Abstract = {{Evidence from cognitive and social neuroscience research suggests that
   Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to attribute mental states to others,
   is mediated by a group of brain regions collectively known as the ToM
   network. Nevertheless, there is significant variability in the
   functional activation of regions within this network across tasks. The
   goal of the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study
   was to examine the common and differential neural mechanisms of two
   aspects of ToM processing (emotion/mental-state recognition and
   intentional attribution) using three distinct, but complementary ToM
   tasks (Reading the Mind in the Eyes (RMIE), Reading the Mind in the
   Voice (RMIV), and Intentional Causal Attribution) in healthy adults.
   Participant accuracy was significantly worse in the ToM compared to the
   control condition across all tasks. Brain activation analyses replicated
   previously reported activation in inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and
   middle temporal gyrus extending to posterior superior temporal sulcus
   (pSTS) in RMIE. Activation in the fusiform gyrus and bilateral middle
   temporal gyrus extending to temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) was unique
   to causality task. A region-of-interest analysis revealed shared
   activation in left IFG for RMIE and RMIV as well as TPJ recruitment
   specific to the causality task. The role of right TPJ in the causality
   task was further supported by a percent signal change analysis. A
   conjunction analysis revealed overlap in left IFG, left precentral
   gyrus, and left superior frontal gyrus activity across all tasks. These
   findings highlight common and differential recruitment of ToM regions
   according to task demand. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IBRO.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Depression is linked to alterations in both emotion and
   self-processing. The current study used functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) to assess neural activation in healthy and depressed
   youth to a novel task that combined emotion processing with self- face
   recognition.
   Methods: An fMRI study involving 81 adolescents (50.6\% females; Mage=
   14.61, SD= 1.65) comprised of depressed (DEP, n= 43), and healthy
   controls (HC, n= 38). Participants completed a clinical interview and
   selfreport measures during an initial assessment. In the scanner,
   adolescents completed a face recognition task, viewing emotional (happy,
   sad, neutral) images of their own face (self) or the face of another
   youth (other).
   Results: DEP youth showed higher activity in the cuneus (F= 26.29) and
   post and precentral gyri (F= 20.76), across all conditions compared to
   HC. Sad faces elicited higher posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus (F=
   10.36) and inferior parietal cortex activity (F= 11.0), and self faces
   elicited higher precuneus, fusiform (F= 16.39), insula and putamen (F=
   16.82) activity in all youth. DEP showed higher middle temporal activity
   to neutral faces but lower activity to sad faces compared to HC, who
   showed the opposite pattern (F= 12.86). DEP also showed hypoactive mid-
   temporal limbic activity relative to controls when identifying their
   self happy face vs. neutral face, yet showed hyperactivity when
   identifying the other happy face vs. neutral face, and HC showed the
   opposite pattern (F= 10.94).
   Conclusions: The neurophysiology of self-face recognition is altered in
   adolescent depression. Specifically, depression was associated with
   decreased activity in neural areas that support emotional and
   associative processing for positive self-faces and increased processing
   for neutral self-faces. These results suggest that depression in
   adolescents is associated with hypoactive emotional processing and
   encoding of positive self-related visual information. This abnormal
   neural activity at the intersection of reward and self-processing among
   depressed youth might have long lasting impact in self-formation and
   future adult self-representations, given that adolescence is a sensitive
   period for self-development.}},

Title = {{Subclinical maternal depressive symptoms modulate right inferior frontal
   response to inferring affective mental states of adults but not of
   infants}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{229}},
Pages = {{32-40}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Being a mother of young children increases the risk of
   depression characterised by deficits in inferring what a person is
   feeling, i.e., affective theory of mind (aToM). Despite the adverse
   consequences for mothers, children, families, and society as a whole,
   little is known of how the brain functions underlying aToM ability are
   affected by subclinical maternal depressive symptoms, and act as a risk
   indicator for major depressive disorders (MDD).
   Methods: Thirty healthy mothers with varying levels of depressive
   symptoms underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while
   performing mind-reading tasks based on the emotional expressions of
   adult eyes and infant faces.
   Results: In the adult eyes-based mind-reading task, mothers with more
   severe depressive symptoms showed less activation in the right inferior
   frontal gyrus (IFG), a central part of the putative mirror neuron system
   (pMNS). This was unrelated to behavioural performance decline in the
   task. However, brain activation involved in the infant face-based
   mind-reading task was not affected by depressive symptoms.
   Limitations: Although aToM ability, assessed by mind-reading tasks, can
   be distinguished from empathy, these can be interacting functions of the
   pMNS, wherein they could mutually affect each other.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that functional activation of the
   right IFG, which underlies aToM ability, has variable vulnerability to
   maternal depressive symptoms according to the type of social signal.
   This functional decline of the right IFG may be a risk indicator for
   clinical maternal depression, which is associated with impaired social
   functioning and communication conflicts with family members and other
   social supporters.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Continued development and refinement of resting state
   functional connectivity (RSFC) fMRI techniques in both animal and
   clinical studies has enhanced our comprehension of the adverse effects
   of stress on psychiatric health. The objective of the current study was
   to assess both maternal behavior and resting state functional
   connectivity (RSFC) changes in these animals when they were dams caring
   for their own young. It was hypothesized that ECSS exposed dams would
   express depressed maternal care and exhibit similar (same networks), yet
   different specific changes in RSFC (different individual nuclei) than
   reported when they were adult females.
   Methods: We have developed an ethologically relevant transgenerational
   model of the role of chronic social stress (CSS) in the etiology of
   postpartum depression and anxiety. Initial fMRI investigation of the CSS
   model indicates that early life exposure to CSS (ECSS) induces long term
   changes in functional connectivity in adult nulliparous female F1
   offspring.
   Results: ECSS in F1 dams resulted in depressed maternal care
   specifically during early lactation, consistent with previous CSS
   studies, and induced changes in functional connectivity in regions
   associated with sensory processing, maternal and emotional
   responsiveness, memory, and the reward pathway, with robust changes in
   anterior cingulate circuits.
   Limitations: The sample sizes for the fMRI groups were low, limiting
   statistical power.
   Conclusion: This behavioral and functional neuroanatomical foundation
   can now be used to enhance our understanding of the neural etiology of
   early life stress associated disorders and test preventative measures
   and treatments for stress related disorders.}},

Abstract = {{The 2016 U.S. presidential election yielded distress among many
   individuals who identify with historically marginalized groups. We used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging and psychological measures to test
   the hypotheses that neural response to reward, probing the nucleus
   accumbens (NAcc) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and social support
   would ameliorate the effects of election distress among those who felt
   negatively affected by the result. Within 4 months of the 2016 U.S.
   presidential election, we tested human participants who felt affected by
   the election result (n = 40, M-age = 21.9 years, 28 female) and control
   participants (n = 20, M-age = 20.25 years, 12 female) who did not feel
   affected by the election result. Election-related distress significantly
   differed between the groups, and distress accounted for over half of the
   relationship between discrimination experiences and depression symptoms
   among affected individuals. NAcc activation, connectivity between the
   NAcc and mPFC, and family support moderated the associations between
   election distress and depression symptoms. Prior work has primarily
   investigated mesolimbic circuitry in reward and motivation contexts, but
   our findings extend the relevance of functioning in this circuitry to
   ameliorating psychological manifestations of acute distress after shifts
   in political climate. These findings highlight the psychological effects
   of this important historic event and identify neurobiological and social
   mechanisms associated with individual differences in response to
   election distress.}},

Abstract = {{Many human characteristics must be evaluated to comprehensively
   understand an individual, and measurements of the corresponding
   cognition/behavior are required. Brain imaging by functional MRI (fMRI)
   has been widely used to examine brain function related to human
   cognition/behavior. However, few aspects of cognition/behavior of
   individuals or experimental groups can be examined through task-based
   fMRI. Recently, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) signals have been shown to
   represent functional infrastructure in the brain that is highly involved
   in processing information related to cognition/behavior. Using rs-fMRI
   may allow diverse information about the brain through a single MRI scan
   to be obtained, as rs-fMRI does not require stimulus tasks. In this
   study, we attempted to identify a set of functional networks
   representing cognition/behavior that are related to a wide variety of
   human characteristics and to evaluate these characteristics using
   rs-fMRI data. If possible, these findings would support the potential of
   rs-fMRI to provide diverse information about the brain. We used
   resting-state fMRI and a set of 130 psychometric parameters that cover
   most human characteristics, including those related to intelligence and
   emotional quotients and social ability/skill. We identified 163 brain
   regions by VBM analysis using regression analysis with 130 psychometric
   parameters. Next, using a 163 x 163 correlation matrix, we identified
   functional networks related to 111 of the 130 psychometric parameters.
   Finally, we made an 8-class support vector machine classifiers
   corresponding to these 111 functional networks. Our results demonstrate
   that rs-fMRI signals contain intrinsic information about brain function
   related to cognition/behaviors and that this set of 111
   networks/classifiers can be used to comprehensively evaluate human
   characteristics.}},

   of these networks, and tests for relationships between neural
   development and behavioral changes in reasoning about others' minds
   ('theory of mind', ToM). A large sample of children (n = 122, 3-12
   years), and adults (n = 33), watched a short movie while undergoing
   fMRI. The movie highlights the characters' bodily sensations (often
   pain) and mental states (beliefs, desires, emotions), and is a feasible
   experiment for young children. Here we report three main findings: (1)
   ToM and pain networks are functionally distinct by age 3 years, (2)
   functional specialization increases throughout childhood, and (3)
   functional maturity of each network is related to increasingly
   anti-correlated responses between the networks. Furthermore, the most
   studied milestone in ToM development, passing explicit false-belief
   tasks, does not correspond to discontinuities in the development of the
   social brain.}},

Title = {{Network-specific sex differentiation of intrinsic brain function in
   males with autism}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR AUTISM}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{MAR 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: The male predominance in the prevalence of autism spectrum
   disorder (ASD) has motivated research on sex differentiation in ASD.
   Multiple sources of evidence have suggested a neurophenotypic
   convergence of ASD-related characteristics and typical sex differences.
   Two existing, albeit competing, models provide predictions on such
   neurophenotypic convergence. These two models are testable with
   neuroimaging. Specifically, the Extreme Male Brain (EMB) model predicts
   that ASD is associated with enhanced brain maleness in both males and
   females with ASD (i.e., a shift-towards-maleness). In contrast, the
   Gender Incoherence (GI) model predicts a shift-towards-maleness in
   females, yet a shift-towards-femaleness in males with ASD.
   Methods: To clarify whether either model applies to the intrinsic
   functional properties of the brain in males with ASD, we measured the
   statistical overlap between typical sex differences and ASD-related
   atypicalities in resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) datasets largely available
   in males. Main analyses focused on two large-scale R-fMRI samples: 357
   neurotypical (NT) males and 471 NT females from the 1000 Functional
   Connectome Project and 360 males with ASD and 403 NT males from the
   Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange.
   Results: Across all R-fMRI metrics, results revealed coexisting, but
   network-specific, shift-towards-maleness and shift-towards-femaleness in
   males with ASD. A shift-towards-maleness mostly involved the default
   network, while a shift-towards-femaleness mostly occurred in the
   somatomotor network. Explorations of the associated cognitive processes
   using available cognitive ontology maps indicated that higher-order
   social cognitive functions corresponded to the shift-towards-maleness,
   while lower-order sensory motor processes corresponded to the
   shift-towards-femaleness.
   Conclusions: The present findings suggest that atypical intrinsic brain
   properties in males with ASD partly reflect mechanisms involved in
   sexual differentiation. A model based on network-dependent atypical sex
   mosaicism can synthesize prior competing theories on factors involved in
   sex differentiation in ASD.}},

Title = {{Adult Attachment Affects Neural Response to Preference-Inferring in
   Ambiguous Scenarios: Evidence From an fMRI Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{MAR 6}},
Abstract = {{Humans are highly social animals, and the ability to cater to the
   preferences of other individuals is encouraged by society.
   Preference-inferring is an important aspect of the theory of mind (TOM).
   Many previous studies have shown that attachment style is closely
   related to TOM ability. However, little is known about the effects of
   adult attachment style on preferences inferring under different levels
   of certainty. Here, we investigated how adult attachment style affects
   neural activity underlying preferences inferred under different levels
   of certainty by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The
   fMRI results demonstrated that adult attachment influenced the
   activation of anterior insula (AI) and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in
   response to ambiguous preference-inferring. More specifically, in the
   ambiguous preference condition, the avoidant attached groups exhibited a
   significantly enhanced activation than secure and anxious attached
   groups in left IPL; the anxious attached groups exhibited a
   significantly reduced activation secure attached group in left IPL. In
   addition, the anxious attached groups exhibited a significantly reduced
   activation than secure and avoidant attached groups in left AI. These
   results were also further confirmed by the subsequent PPI analysis. The
   results from current study suggest that, under ambiguous situations, the
   avoidant attached individuals show lower sensitivity to the preference
   of other individuals and need to invest more cognitive resources for
   preference-reasoning; while compared with avoidant attached group, the
   anxious attached individuals express high tolerance for uncertainty and
   a higher ToM proficiency. Results from the current study imply that
   differences in preference-inferring under ambiguous conditions
   associated with different levels of individual attachment may explain
   the differences in interpersonal interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Selection of sexual partners is among the most critical decisions that
   individuals make and is therefore strongly shaped by evolution. In
   social species, where communication signals can convey substantial
   information about the identity, state, or quality of the signaler,
   accurate interpretation of communication signals for mate choice is
   crucial. Despite the importance of social information processing, to
   date, relatively little is known about the neurobiological mechanisms
   that contribute to sexual decision making and preferences. In this
   study, we used a combination of whole-brain functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI), immediate early gene expression, and behavior
   tests to identify the circuits that are important for the perception and
   evaluation of courtship songs in a female songbird, the zebra finch
   (Taeniopygia guttata). Female zebra finches are sensitive to subtle
   differences in male song performance and strongly prefer the longer,
   faster, and more stereotyped courtship songs to non-courtship
   renditions. Using BOLD fMRI and EGR1 expression assays, we uncovered a
   novel region involved in auditory perceptual decision making located in
   a sensory integrative region of the avian central nidopallium outside
   the traditionally studied auditory forebrain pathways. Changes in
   activity in this region in response to acoustically similar but
   categorically divergent stimuli showed stronger parallels to behavioral
   responses than an auditory sensory region. These data highlight a
   potential role for the caudocentral nidopallium (NCC) as a novel node in
   the avian circuitry underlying the evaluation of acoustic signals and
   their use in mate choice.}},

Abstract = {{Distinguishing the effects of own from others' actions is a prerequisite
   for effective interpersonal functioning. Individuals differ in their
   ability to do this. For example, difficulties in self-other attribution
   have been linked to positive symptoms of schizophrenia such as

   challenge. The goal of the present study was to examine relationships
   between individual differences in resting-state functional connectivity
   and self-other attribution performance. Fifty-five healthy adults
   completed a resting-state fMRI scan and an attribution task that
   involved tapping at irregular intervals while listening to a tone
   sequence. The likelihood that tones in the sequence corresponded to the
   participant's taps was systematically varied. Using group independent
   component analysis (ICA) and dual regression, we found that connectivity
   between prefrontal networks associated with self-referential processing
   and regions sensitive to externally-generated stimuli was modulated by
   participants' ability to accurately assess the proportion of tones
   belonging to self versus other. These findings shed additional light on
   the neural mechanisms of agency, emphasising that connectivity with

Abstract = {{Learning often occurs in communicative and collaborative settings, yet
   almost all research into the neural basis of memory relies on
   participants encoding and retrieving information on their own. We
   investigated whether learning linguistic labels in a collaborative
   context at least partly relies on cognitively and neurally distinct
   representations, as compared to learning in an individual context.
   Healthy human participants learned labels for sets of abstract shapes in
   three different tasks. They came up with labels with another person in a
   collaborative communication task (collaborative condition), by
   themselves (individual condition), or were given pre-determined
   unrelated labels to learn by themselves (arbitrary condition).
   Immediately after learning, participants retrieved and produced the
   labels aloud during a communicative task in the MRI scanner. The fMRI
   results show that the retrieval of collaboratively generated labels as
   compared to individually learned labels engages brain regions involved
   in understanding others (mentalizing or theory of mind) and
   autobiographical memory, including the medial prefrontal cortex, the
   right temporoparietal junction and the precuneus. This study is the
   first to show that collaboration during encoding affects the neural
   networks involved in retrieval.}},

   affective vocalisations is reflected by the neural response in the
   superior temporal sulcus}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},

Abstract = {{Accurate perception of the emotional content of vocalisations is
   essential for successful social communication and interaction. However,
   it is not clear whether our ability to perceive emotional cues from
   vocal signals is specific to human signals, or can be applied to other
   species' vocalisations. Here, we address this issue by evaluating the
   perception and neural response to affective vocalisations from different
   primate species (humans, chimpanzees and macaques). We found that the
   ability of human participants to discriminate emotional valence varied
   as a function of phylogenetic distance between species. Participants
   were most accurate at discriminating the emotional valence of human
   vocalisations, followed by chimpanzee vocalisations. They were, however,
   unable to accurately discriminate the valence of macaque vocalisations.
   Next, we used fMRI to compare human brain responses to human, chimpanzee
   and macaque vocalisations. We found that regions in the superior
   temporal lobe that are closely associated with the perception of complex
   auditory signals, showed a graded response to affective vocalisations
   from different species with the largest response to human vocalisations,
   an intermediate response to chimpanzees, and the smallest response to

Abstract = {{Creativity is an adaptive way of thinking and plays a key role in
   problem solving. Recent brain imaging studies focused on structural and
   functional characteristics of the brain that are correlated with
   creativity. But whether and how the association between creativity and
   the brain is moderated by individuals' cultural traits remains unclear.
   We integrated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
   questionnaire measures (Williams creativity aptitude test) of trait
   creativity and self-construal (e.g., interdependence) in male adults to
   examine whether trait creativity is associated with neural activities
   underlying social cognition and whether and how the association is
   moderated by individuals' self-construals. We found that interdependence
   moderates the association between trait creativity and neural activities
   in the left superior temporal sulcus, right anterior insular, right
   temporal-parietal junction and right precentral gyrus engaged in
   reflection of one's own social attributes. Interdependence also
   moderates the association between trait creativity and neural activities
   in the left superior temporal sulcus and right posterior insular
   involved in reflection of a friend's social attributes. The link of
   trait creativity and the functional connectivity between the medial
   prefrontal cortex and postcentral gyri during reflection of a friend's
   social attributes is also moderated by interdependence. Participants
   with high and low creativity traits can be dissociated in a
   three-dimension space defined by integration of interdependence and the
   brain activity underlying reflection of one's own and the friend's
   attributes. Our findings suggest that trait creativity is imprinted on
   the social brain and the link between trait creativity and the neural
   activities underlying the processing of self and others is moderated by
   a cultural trait.}},

Abstract = {{Now over 20 years old, functional MRI (fMRI) has a large and growing
   literature that is best synthesised with meta-analytic tools. As most
   authors do not share image data, only the peak activation coordinates
   (foci) reported in the article are available for Coordinate-Based
   Meta-Analysis (CBMA). Neuroimaging meta-analysis is used to (i) identify
   areas of consistent activation; and (ii) build a predictive model of
   task type or cognitive process for new studies (reverse inference). To
   simultaneously address these aims, we propose a Bayesian point process
   hierarchical model for CBMA. We model the foci from each study as a
   doubly stochastic Poisson process, where the study-specific log
   intensity function is characterized as a linear combination of a
   high-dimensional basis set. A sparse representation of the intensities
   is guaranteed through latent factor modeling of the basis coefficients.
   Within our framework, it is also possible to account for the effect of
   study-level covariates (meta-regression), significantly expanding the
   capabilities of the current neuroimaging meta-analysis methods
   available. We apply our methodology to synthetic data and neuroimaging
   meta-analysis datasets.}},

Abstract = {{Mimicry is a facilitator of social bonds in humans, from infancy. This
   facilitation is made possible through changing the reward value of
   social stimuli; for example, we like and affiliate more with people who
   mimic us. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are marked by difficulties in
   forming social bonds. In this study, we investigate whether the
   reward-related neural response to being mimicked is altered in
   individuals with ASD, using a simple conditioning paradigm. Multiple
   studies in humans and nonhuman primates have established a crucial role
   for the ventral striatal (VS) region in responding to rewards.In this
   study, adults with ASD and matched controls first underwent a
   conditioning task outside the scanner, where they were mimicked by one
   face and anti-mimicked' by another. In the second part, participants
   passively viewed the conditioned faces in a 3T MRI scanner using a
   multi-echo sequence. The differential neural response towards mimicking
   vs. anti-mimicking faces in the VS was tested for group differences as
   well as an association with self-reported autistic traits. Multiple
   regression analysis revealed lower left VS response to mimicry
   (mimicking>anti-mimicking faces) in the ASD group compared to controls.
   The VS response to mimicry was negatively correlated with autistic
   traits across the whole sample. Our results suggest that for individuals
   with ASD and high autistic traits, being mimicked is associated with
   lower reward-related neural response. This result points to a potential
   mechanism underlying the difficulties reported by many of individuals
   with ASD in building social rapport.}},

Abstract = {{Socio-behavioral impairments are important characteristics of autism
   spectrum disorders (ASD) and MRI-based studies are pursued to identify a
   neurobiological basis behind these conditions. This paper presents an
   MRI-based study undertaken to (i) identify the differences in brain
   activities due to ASD, (ii) verify whether such differences exist within
   the social brain' circuit which is hypothesized to be responsible for
   social functions, and (iii) uncover potential compensatory mechanisms
   within the identified differences in brain activities. In this study, a
   whole-brain voxel-wise analysis is performed using resting-state fMRI
   data from 598 adolescent males, that is openly available from the ABIDE
   consortium. A new method is developed, which can (i) extract the
   discriminative brain activities, that provide high separability between
   the blood oxygenation time-series signals from ASD and neurotypical
   populations, (ii) select the activities that are relevant to ASD by
   evaluating the correlation between the separability and traditional
   severity scores, and (iii) map the spatial pattern of regions
   responsible for generating the discriminative activities. The results
   show that the most discriminative brain activities occur within a subset
   of the social brain that is involved with affective aspects of social
   processing, thereby supporting the idea of the social brain and also its
   fractionalization in ASD. Further, it has also been found that the
   diminished activities in the posterior cingulate area are potentially
   compensated by enhanced activities in the ventromedial prefrontal and
   anterior temporal areas within the social brain. Hemispherical
   lateralization is also observed on such compensatory activities.}},

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized
   by core deficits in social functioning. Core autistics traits refer to
   poor social and imagination skills, poor attention-switching/strong
   focus of attention, exceptional attention to detail, as expressed by the
   autism-spectrum quotient. Over the years, the importance of the
   cerebellum in the aetiology of autism spectrum disorder has been
   acknowledged. Neuroimaging studies have provided a strong support to
   this view, showing both structural and functional connectivity
   alterations to affect the cerebellum in autism spectrum disorder.
   According to the underconnectivity theory, disrupted connectivity within
   cerebello-cerebral networks has been specifically implicated in the
   aetiology of autism spectrum disorder. However, inconsistent results
   have been generated across studies. In this study, an integrated
   approach has been used in a selected population of adults with autism
   spectrum disorder to analyse both cerebellar morphometry and functional
   connectivity. In individuals with autism spectrum disorder, a decreased
   cerebellar grey matter volume affected the right Crus II, a region
   showing extensive connections with cerebral areas related to social
   functions. This grey matter reduction correlates with the degree of
   autistic traits as measured by autism-spectrum quotient. Interestingly,
   altered functional connectivity was found between the reduced cerebellar
   Crus II and contralateral cerebral regions, such as frontal and temporal
   areas. Overall, the present data suggest that adults with autism
   spectrum disorder present with specific cerebellar structural
   alterations that may affect functional connectivity within
   cerebello-cerebral modules relevant to social processing and account for
   core autistics traits.}},

Abstract = {{Schizophrenia is characterized by social interaction deficits
   contributing to poor functional outcome. Hand gesture use is
   particularly impaired, linked to frontal lobe dysfunction and frontal
   grey matter deficits. The functional neural correlates of impaired
   gesturing are currently unclear. We therefore investigated aberrant
   brain activity during impaired gesturing in schizophrenia. We included
   22 patients with schizophrenia and 25 healthy control participants
   matched for age, gender, and education level. We obtained functional
   magnetic resonance imaging data using an event-related paradigm to
   assess brain activation during gesture planning and execution. Group
   differences in whole brain effects were calculated using factorial
   designs. Gesture ratings were performed by a single rater, blind to
   diagnoses and clinical presentation. During gesture planning and
   execution both groups activated brain areas of the praxis network.
   However, patients had reduced dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and
   increased inferior parietal lobe (IPL) activity. Performance accuracy
   was associated with IPL activity in patients. Furthermore, patients
   activated temporal poles, amygdala and hippocampus during gesture
   planning, which was associated with delusion severity. Finally, patients
   demonstrated increased dorsomedial prefrontal cortex activity during
   planning of novel gestures. We demonstrate less prefrontal, but more IPL
   and limbic activity during gesturing in schizophrenia. IPL activity was
   associated with performance accuracy, whereas limbic activity was linked
   to delusion severity. These findings may reflect impaired social action
   planning and a limbic interference with gestures in schizophrenia
   contributing to poor gesture performance and consequently poor social
   functioning in schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{Functional neuroimaging of the human amygdala has been of great interest
   to uncover the neural underpinnings of emotions, mood, motivation,
   social cognition, and decision making, as well as their dysfunction in
   psychiatric disorders. Yet, several factors limit in vivo imaging of
   amygdalar function, most importantly its location deep within the
   temporal lobe adjacent to air-filled cavities that cause magnetic field
   inhomogeneities entailing signal dropouts. Additionally, the amygdala
   and the extended amygdalar region consist of several substructures,
   which have been assigned different functions and have important
   implications for functional and effective connectivity studies. Here we
   show that high-resolution ultra-high field fMRI at 7 T can be used to
   overcome these fundamental challenges for acquisition and can meet some
   of the demands posed by the complex neuroanatomy and -physiology in this
   region. Utilizing the inherently high SNR, we use an optimized
   preprocessing and data analysis strategy to demonstrate that imaging of
   the (extended) amygdala is highly reliable and robust. Using unsmoothed
   single-subject data allowed us to differentiate brain activation during
   processing of emotional faces in the central and basolateral amygdala
   and, for the first time, in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis
   (BNST), which is critically involved in the neural mechanisms of anxiety
   and threat monitoring. We also provide a quantitative assessment of
   single subject sensitivity, which is relevant for connectivity studies
   that rely on time course extraction of functionally-defined volumes of
   interest.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY}},

Volume = {{133}},

Abstract = {{How deja vu works has long been a mystery, partially because of its
   characteristics of unpredictable occurrences and quick disappearances,
   which make it difficult to be explored. Previous studies have described
   the anatomical structures underlying deja vu in healthy subjects;
   however, the functional mechanism of deja vu remains unclear. Therefore,
   this study investigated the brain structural and functional components
   underlying deja vu by combining voxel-based morphometry analysis (VBM)
   with resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC). The VBM analysis
   revealed that the anterior parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) had significantly
   less grey matter volume (GMV) in high deja vu group than low group,
   confirming previous studies. Further functional connectivity analysis
   revealed that the frequency of deja vu experiences was negatively
   correlated with the strength of the rsFC between anterior dorsal lateral
   prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior PHG but positively correlated
   with the strength of the rsFC between posterior DLPFC and posterior PHG.
   Moreover, the frequency of deja vu experiences was negatively correlated
   with the strength of the rsFC between the anterior and posterior regions
   of the PHG. These findings indicated that familiarity without
   recollection (PHG) and superior context monitoring (DLPFC) are critical
   for real-life deja vu experiences.}},

Abstract = {{The transition from adolescent to adult cognition and emotional control
   requires neurodevelopmental maturation likely involving intrinsic
   functional networks (IFNs). Normal neurodevelopment may be vulnerable to
   disruption from environmental insult such as alcohol consumption
   commonly initiated during adolescence. To test potential disruption to
   IFN maturation, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (rs-fMRI) in 581 no-to-low alcohol-consuming and 117
   moderate-to-high-drinking youth. Functional seed-to-voxel connectivity
   analysis assessed age, sex, and moderate alcohol drinking on
   default-mode, executive-control, salience, reward, and emotion networks
   and tested cognitive and motor coordination correlates of network
   connectivity. Among no-to-low alcohol-consuming adolescents,
   executive-control frontolimbicstriatal connectivity was stronger in
   older than younger adolescents, particularly boys, and predicted better
   ability in balance, memory, and impulse control. Connectivity patterns
   in moderate-to-high-drinking youth were tested mainly in late
   adolescence when drinking was initiated. Implicated was the emotion
   network with attenuated connectivity to default-mode network regions.
   Our cross-sectional rs-fMRI findings from this large cohort of
   adolescents show sexual dimorphism in connectivity and suggest
   neurodevelopmental rewiring toward stronger and spatially more
   distributed executive-control networking in older than younger
   adolescents. Functional network rewiring in moderate-to-high-drinking
   adolescents may impede maturation of affective and self-reflection
   systems and obscure maturation of complex social and emotional
   behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Despite accruing evidence showing that positive emotions facilitate
   stress recovery, the neural basis for this effect remains unclear. To
   identify the underlying mechanism, we compared stress recovery for
   people reflecting on a stressor while in a positive emotional context
   with that for people in a neutral context. While blood-oxygen-level
   dependent data were being collected, participants (N = 43) performed a
   stressful anagram task, which was followed by a recovery period during
   which they reflected on the stressor while watching a positive or
   neutral video. Participants also reported positive and negative emotions
   throughout the task as well as retrospective thoughts about the task.
   Although there was no effect of experimental context on emotional
   recovery, we found that ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)
   activation during the stressor predicted more positive emotions during
   recovery, which in turn predicted less negative emotions during
   recovery. In addition, the relationship between vmPFC activation and
   positive emotions during recovery was mediated by decentering-the
   meta-cognitive detachment of oneself from one's feelings. In sum,
   successful recovery from a stressor seems to be due to activation of
   positive emotion-related regions during the stressor itself as well as
   to their downstream effects on certain cognitive forms of emotion
   regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Independent vs interdependent self-construal is a concept that reflects
   how people perceive the relationship between self and other people,
   which has been extensively examined across disciplines. However, little
   evidence on the whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) pattern of
   independent vs interdependent self-construal has been reported. Here, in
   a sample of 51 healthy participants, we used resting-state functional
   magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based FC analysis (i.e. FC strength
   and seed-based FC) by measuring the temporal correlation of blood oxygen
   level-dependent signals between spatially separate brain regions to
   investigate the neural mechanism of independent vs interdependent
   self-construal. First, we found that FC strength of bilateral posterior
   cingulate cortex and precuneus, and left inferior frontal gyrus were
   positively correlated with the independent vs interdependent score.
   Seed-based FC analysis with these three regions as seeds revealed that,
   FC within default mode network and executive control network was
   positively correlated with the independent vs interdependent score.
   Negative correlation with independent vs interdependent score was shown
   in the connections between default mode network and executive control
   regions. Taking together, our results provide a comprehensive FC
   architecture of the independent vs interdependent self-construal and
   advance the understanding of the interplay between culture, mind and

Abstract = {{Behavioral inhibition (BI) is an early temperamental profile
   characterized by negative reactivity to novelty, withdrawal from social
   situations, and increased risk for social anxiety. Previous research
   associated BI assessed in early childhood to striatal hypersensitivity
   in mid-to-late adolescence. The present study examined this association
   among 10 year-olds, characterized with BI at ages 24 and 36 months on
   measures of temperamental reactivity. Participants (n = 40) were studied
   at age 10 using a reward processing task during functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI). Child- and maternal-report of social anxiety
   symptoms was collected at ages 10 and 13. Findings indicate greater
   caudate activation and stronger striatal connectivity in high, compared
   to low, behaviorally inhibited children. Caudate activation related to
   social anxiety symptoms at both ages. These findings suggest that
   enhanced striatal responsivity reliably manifests among high
   behaviorally inhibited children as early as age 10. This may reflect
   hyper-sensitivity to reward or excessive motivation to avoid errors.}},

Abstract = {{Sleep suffers during adolescence and is related to academic, emotional
   and social behaviors. How this normative change relates to ongoing brain
   development remains unresolved. The default mode network (DMN), a
   large-scale brain network important for complex cognition and
   socioemotional processing, undergoes intra-network integration and
   inter-network segregation during adolescence. Using resting state
   functional connectivity and actigraphy over 14 days, we examined
   correlates of naturalistic individual differences in sleep duration and
   quality in the DMN at rest in 45 human adolescents (ages 14-18).
   Variation in sleep quality, but not duration, was related to weaker
   intrinsic DMN connectivity, such that those with worse quality sleep
   evinced weaker intra-network connectivity at rest. These novel findings
   suggest sleep quality, a relatively unexplored sleep index, is related
   to adolescent brain function in a network that contributes to behavioral
   maturation and undergoes development during adolescence.}},

Abstract = {{Proactive interference (PI) is the tendency for information learned
   earlier to interfere with more recently learned information. In the
   present study, we induced PI by presenting items from the same category
   over several trials. This results in a build-up of PI and reduces the
   discriminability of the items in each subsequent trial. We introduced
   emotional (e.g. disgust) and neutral (e.g. furniture) categories and
   examined how increasing levels of PI affected performance for both
   stimulus types. Participants were scanned using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) performing a 5-item probe recognition task. We
   modeled responses and corresponding response times with a hierarchical
   diffusion model. Results showed that PI effects on latent processes
   (i.e. reduced drift rate) were similar for both stimulus types, but the
   effect of PI on drift rate was less pronounced PI for emotional compared
   to neutral stimuli. The decline in the drift rate was accompanied by an
   increase in neural activation in parahippocampal regions and this
   relationship was more strongly observed for neutral stimuli compared to
   emotional stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{Reconciliation is an integral part of our social lives. Nevertheless, if
   a victim perceives the risk of further exploitation by his/her
   transgressor as non-negligible, the victim may well have difficulty
   forgiving the transgressor. Therefore, a key ingredient of
   reconciliation is the transgressor's sincere apology. Theoretical and
   empirical studies have shown that transgressors can make their apologies
   credible by incurring a substantial cost. Therefore, we hypothesized
   that costly apologies, compared to non-costly apologies (i.e., simply
   saying ``sorry{''}), would effectively communicate a transgressor's
   conciliatory intention. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) study, participants were asked to imagine a friend committing a
   mild interpersonal transgression (e.g., standing up the participant) and
   then apologizing in a costly fashion, apologizing in a non-costly
   fashion, or not apologizing at all. Compared to non-costly apologies and
   non-apologies, costly apologies (signals of conciliatory intention) more
   strongly activated the theory-of-mind network (i.e., bilateral
   temporoparietal junction, precuneus, medial prefrontal cortex).
   Moreover, we did not observe any significant differences in brain
   responses to non-costly apologies and non-apology controls. These
   results underscore the importance of costly signals in human
   communication and in human peace-making in particular. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Effortful control, or the ability to suppress a dominant response to
   perform a subdominant response, is an early-emerging temperament trait

   regulatory impairments, suggesting diminished effortful control. This
   study compared the development of effortful control in preschool boys
   with FXS (n = 97) and typical development (n = 32). Unlike their typical
   peers, the boys with FXS did not exhibit growth in effortful control
   over time, which could not be accounted for by adaptive impairments,
   FMR1 molecular measures, or autism symptoms. These results contribute to
   our understanding of the childhood phenotype of FXS that may be linked

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{156-165}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Objective: In previous studies, post-stroke depression (PSD) was found
   to be related to stroke characteristics as well as social and
   psychological factors. This study identified altered functional
   connectivity (FC) in patients with PSD at the subacute phase in three
   brain networks: default mood network (DMN), cognitive control network
   (CCN), and affective network (AN). The correlation between FC and the
   severity of PSD was investigated.
   Materials and methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance image
   (rs-fMRI) was performed on 26 PSD patients (6 females), 24 stroke
   patients without depression (5 females), and 24 age-matched normal
   controls (6 females) all aged 40-75 years. The FC values of DMN, CCN,
   and AN were calculated and compared among the three groups. The Hamilton
   Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) (17 items) was employed and the score was
   correlated with FC in the PSD group.
   Results: The FCs of the three networks were altered in PSD patients at
   the subacute phase compared to stroke patients without depression and
   normal controls (NC). Moreover, the left inferior parietal gyrus, the
   left orbital part of inferior frontal gyrus, and left angular gyrus
   (which indicated altered FC) were significantly correlated with HDRS
   scores in PSD patients.
   Conclusions: Alteration of the three neural networks might be correlated
   with the development of PSD at the subacute phase of stroke.}},

Journal = {{ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{228-230}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Problems related to the capacity to successfully engage response
   inhibition are considered a risk factor for the development of substance
   use disorders (SUDs), but the evidence has been predominantly
   cross-sectional. In this commentary, we argue that recent longitudinal
   studies with multi-modal measures of response inhibition can improve
   understanding of how response inhibition may intersect with substance
   use among adolescents. Most Stop-Signal studies suggest that slower
   response inhibition predicts substance use progressions, with one multi
   site study showing greater fronto-parietal activity indicative of risk.
   Most Go-NoGo studies suggest that blunted activation of prefrontal
   cortical areas during response inhibition predicts substance use
   progressions, while commission errors are less effective in identifying
   adolescents at risk. Studies differ in subject populations, outcome
   measures, statistical methods, and BOLD response contrasts, which
   challenge the capacity to compare and generalize findings. We encourage
   research teams throughout the globe to undertake multi-modal,
   longitudinal studies to assess brain functioning with large sample
   sizes, and when possible, before significant substance use potentially
   obscures interpretation of findings. Systematic review and meta-analysis
   of this growing literature are also important goals for future research.}},

Abstract = {{Responsibility is a necessary prerequisite in the experience of regret.
   The present fMRI study investigated the modulation of responsibility on
   the neural correlates of regret during a sequential risk-taking task.
   Participants were asked to open a series of boxes consecutively and
   decided when to stop. Each box contained a reward, except for one
   containing a devil to zero participant's gain in the trial. Once
   participants stopped, both collected gains and missed chances were
   revealed. We manipulated responsibility by setting two different
   contexts. In the Self (high responsibility) context, participants opened
   boxes and decided when to stop by themselves. In the Computer (low
   responsibility) context, a computer program opened boxes and decided
   when to stop for participants. Before each trial, participants were
   required to decide whether it would be a Self or a Computer context.
   Behaviorally, participants felt less regret (more relief) for gain
   outcome and more regret for the loss outcome in the high-responsibility
   context than low responsibility context. At the neural level, when
   experiencing a gain, high-responsibility trials were characterized by
   stronger activation in mPFC, pgACC, mOFC, and striatum with decreasing
   number of missed chances relative to low responsibility trials. When
   experiencing a loss, low responsibility trials were associated with
   stronger activation in dACC and bilateral insula than
   high-responsibility trials. Conversely, during a loss,
   high-responsibility trials showed more striatum activity than low
   responsibility trials. These results highlighted the sensitivity of the
   frontal region, striatum, and insula to changes in level of
   responsibility.}},

Abstract = {{Encoding the position of another person in space is vital for everyday
   life. Nevertheless, little is known about the specific navigational
   strategies associated with encoding the position of another person in
   the wider spatial environment. We asked two groups of participants to
   learn the location of a target (person or object) during active
   navigation, while optic flow information, a landmark, or both optic flow
   information and a landmark were available in a virtual environment.
   Whereas optic flow information is used for body-based encoding, such as
   the simulation of motor movements, landmarks are used to form an
   abstract, disembodied representation of the environment. During testing,
   we passively moved participants through virtual space, and compared
   their abilities to correctly decide whether the non-visible target was
   before or behind them. Using psychometric functions and the Bayes
   Theorem, we show that both groups assigned similar weights to body-based
   and environment-based cues in the condition, where both cue types were
   available. However, the group who was provided with a person as target
   showed generally reduced position errors compared to the group who was
   provided with an object as target. We replicated this effect in a second
   study with novel participants. This indicates a social advantage in
   spatial encoding, with facilitated processing of both body-based and
   environment-based cues during spatial navigation when the position of a
   person is encoded. This may underlie our critical ability to make
   accurate distance judgments during social interactions, for example,
   during fight or flight responses.}},

   Self-Esteem: A Novel Validity Test of Psychological Measures Using

Abstract = {{Self-esteem, arguably the most important attitudes an individual
   possesses, has been a premier research topic in psychology for more than
   a century. Following a surge of interest in implicit attitude measures
   in the 90s, researchers have tried to assess self-esteem implicitly to
   circumvent the influence of biases inherent in explicit measures.
   However, the validity of implicit self-esteem measures remains elusive.
   Critical tests are often inconclusive, as the validity of such measures
   is examined in the backdrop of imperfect behavioral measures. To
   overcome this serious limitation, we tested the neural validity of the
   most widely used implicit self-esteem measure, the implicit association
   test (IAT). Given the conceptualization of self-esteem as attitude
   toward the self, and neuroscience findings that the reward-related brain
   regions represent an individual's attitude or preference for an object
   when viewing its image, individual differences in implicit self-esteem
   should be associated with neural signals in the reward-related regions
   during passive-viewing of self-face (the most obvious representation of
   the self). Using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) on functional MRI
   (fMRI) data, we demonstrate that the neural signals in the
   reward-related regions were robustly associated with implicit (but not
   explicit) self-esteem, thus providing unique evidence for the neural
   validity of the self-esteem IAT. In addition, both implicit and explicit
   self-esteem were related, although differently, to neural signals in
   regions involved in self-processing. Our finding highlights the utility
   of neuroscience methods in addressing fundamental psychological
   questions and providing unique insights into important psychological
   constructs.}},

Abstract = {{Huntington's disease (HD) can impair social cognition. This study
   investigated whether patients with HD exhibit neural differences to
   healthy controls when they are considering mental and physical states
   relating to the static expressions of human eyes. Thirty-two patients
   with HD and 28 age-matched controls were scanned with fMRI during two
   versions of the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task: The standard version
   requiring mental state judgments, and a comparison version requiring
   judgments about age. HD was associated with behavioral deficits on only
   the mental state eyes task. Contrasting the two versions of the eyes
   task (mental state > age judgment) revealed hypoactivation within left
   middle frontal gyrus and supramarginal gyrus in HD. Subgroup analyses
   comparing premanifest HD patients to age-matched controls revealed
   reduced activity in right supramarginal gyrus and increased activity in
   anterior cingulate during mental state recognition in these patients,
   while manifest HD was associated with hypoactivity in left insula and
   left supramarginal gyrus. When controlling for the effects of healthy
   aging, manifest patients exhibited declining activation within areas
   including right temporal pole. Our findings provide compelling evidence
   for a selective impairment of internal emotional status when patients
   with HD appraise facial features in order to make social judgements.
   Differential activity in temporal and anterior cingulate cortices may
   suggest that poor emotion regulation and emotional egocentricity
   underlie impaired mental state recognition in premanifest patients,
   while more extensive mental state recognition impairments in manifest
   disease reflect dysfunction in neural substrates underlying executive
   functions, and the experience and interpretation of emotion.}},

Abstract = {{Decoding the meaning of others' actions, a crucial step for social
   cognition, involves different neural mechanisms. While the ``mirror{''}
   and ``mentalizing{''} systems have been associated with, respectively,
   the processing of biological actions versus more abstract information,
   their respective contribution to intention understanding is debated.
   Processing social interactions seems to recruit both neural systems,
   with a different weight depending on cues emphasizing either shared
   action goals or shared mental states. We have previously shown that
   observing cooperative and affective social interactions elicits stronger
   activity in key nodes of, respectively, the mirror (left posterior
   superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), superior parietal cortex (SPL), and
   ventral/dorsal premotor cortex (vPMC/dPMC)) and mentalizing
   (ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)) systems. To unveil their causal
   organization, we investigated the effective connectivity underlying the
   observation of human social interactions expressing increasing
   cooperativity (involving left pSTS, SPL, and vPMC) versus affectivity
   (vmPFC) via dynamic causal modeling in 36 healthy human subjects. We
   found strong evidence for a model including the pSTS and vPMC as input
   nodes for the observed interactions. The extrinsic connectivity of this
   model undergoes oppositely valenced modulations, with cooperativity
   promoting positive modulations of connectivity between pSTS and both SPL
   (forward) and vPMC (mainly backward), and affectivity promoting
   reciprocal positive modulations of connectivity between pSTS and vmPFC
   (mainly backward). Alongside fMRI data, such divergent effective
   connectivity suggests that different dimensions underlying the
   processing of social interactions recruit distinct, although strongly
   interconnected, neural pathways associated with, respectively, the
   bottom-up visuomotor processing of motor intentions, and the top-down
   attribution of affective/mental states.}},

Abstract = {{Essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder.
   Drug-resistant ET can benefit from standard surgical stereotactic
   procedures (deep brain stimulation, thalamotomy) or minimally invasive
   high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) or stereotactic radiosurgical
   thalamotomy (SRS-T). Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) is a non-invasive
   imaging method acquired in absence of a task. We examined whether
   rs-fMRI correlates with tremor score on the treated hand (TSTH)
   improvement 1 year after SRS-T.
   We included 17 consecutive patients treated with left unilateral SRS-T
   in Marseille, France. Tremor score evaluation and rs-fMRI were acquired
   at baseline and 1 year after SRS-T. Resting-state data (34 scans) were
   analyzed without a priori hypothesis, in Lausanne, Switzerland. Based on
   degree of improvement in TSTH, to consider SRS-T at least as effective
   as medication, we separated two groups: 1, <= 50\% (n = 6, 35.3\%); 2, >
   50\% (n = 11, 64.7\%). They did not differ statistically by age (p =
   0.86), duration of symptoms (p = 0.41), or lesion volume at 1 year (p =
   0.06).
   We report TSTH improvement correlated with interconnectivity strength
   between salience network with the left claustrum and putamen, as well as
   between bilateral motor cortices, frontal eye fields and left cerebellum
   lobule VI with right visual association area (the former also with
   lesion volume). Longitudinal changes showed additional associations in
   interconnectivity strength between right dorsal attention network with
   ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex and a reminiscent salience network with
   fusiform gyrus.
   Brain connectivity measured by resting-state fMRI relates to clinical
   response after SRS-T. Relevant networks are visual, motor, and
   attention. Interconnectivity between visual and motor areas is a novel
   finding, revealing implication in movement sensory guidance.}},

Title = {{Cognitive control over memory - individual differences in memory
   performance for emotional and neutral material}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{FEB 28}},
Abstract = {{It is widely accepted that people differ in memory performance. The
   ability to control one's memory depends on multiple factors, including
   the emotional properties of the memorized material. While it was widely
   demonstrated that emotion can facilitate memory, it is unclear how
   emotion modifies our ability to suppress memory. One of the reasons for
   the lack of consensus among researchers is that individual differences
   in memory performance were largely neglected in previous studies. We
   used the directed forgetting paradigm in an fMRI study, in which
   subjects viewed neutral and emotional words, which they were instructed
   to remember or to forget. Subsequently, subjects' memory of these words
   was tested. Finally, they assessed the words on scales of valence,
   arousal, sadness and fear. We found that memory performance depended on
   instruction as reflected in the engagement of the lateral prefrontal
   cortex (lateral PFC), irrespective of emotional properties of words.
   While the lateral PFC engagement did not differ between neutral and
   emotional conditions, it correlated with behavioural performance when
   emotional - as opposed to neutral - words were presented. A deeper
   understanding of the underlying brain mechanisms is likely to require a
   study of individual differences in cognitive abilities to suppress
   memory.}},

Abstract = {{Informational social influence theory posits that under conditions of
   uncertainty, we are inclined to look to others for advice. This leaves
   us remarkably vulnerable to being influenced by others' opinions or
   advice. Rational agents, however, do not blindly seek and act on
   arbitrary information, but often consider the quality of its source
   before committing to a course of action. Here, we ask the question of
   whether a collaborator's reputation can increase their social influence
   and, in turn, bias perception and anxiety under changing levels of
   uncertainty. Human male and female participants were asked to provide
   estimations of dot direction using the random dot motion (RDM)
   perceptual discrimination task and were paired with transient
   collaborators of high or low reputation whom provided their own
   estimations. The RDM varied in degrees of uncertainty and joint
   performance accuracy was linked to risk of an electric shock. Despite
   providing identical information, we show that collaborating with a high
   reputation compared with a low reputation partner, led to significantly
   more conformity during the RDM task for uncertain perceptual decisions.
   Consequently, high reputation partners decreased the subjects' anxiety
   during the anticipatory shock periods. fMRI data showed that parametric
   changes in conformity resulted in increased activity in the ventromedial
   PFC, whereas dissent was associated with increased in activity in the
   dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Furthermore, the dACC and
   insula, regions involved in anticipatory pain, were significantly more
   active when collaborating with a low reputation partner. These results
   suggest that information about reputation can influence both cognitive
   and affective processes and in turn alter the neural circuits that
   underlie decision-making and emotion.}},

   The GSAD patients underwent an additional fMRI scan after group
   cognitive behavior therapy (GCBT). Amplitude of low-frequency
   fluctuation (ALFF) and degree centrality (DC) measures were used to
   examine altered regional and integrated spontaneous brain activity in
   group comparisons. After GCBT, ALFF of the right precuneus decreased. At
   baseline, the GSAD group showed higher ALFF in the left precuneus and
   the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and lower ALFF in the lingual gyrus
   compared with the HC group. The DC of the left precuneus and the MTG
   were attenuated and the right putamen increased in the post-treatment
   group. The changes in DC in the precuneus were positively correlated
   with changes in clinical symptom. The abnormal ALFF of the precuneus,

   the neural response to symptom remission after GCBT was achieved by a

Title = {{Large-Scale Brain Networks Supporting Divided Attention across Spatial
   Locations and Sensory Modalities}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{FEB 27}},
Abstract = {{Higher-order cognitive processes were shown to rely on the interplay
   between large-scale neural networks. However, brain networks involved
   with the capability to split attentional resource over multiple spatial
   locations and multiple stimuli or sensory modalities have been largely
   unexplored to date. Here I re-analyzed data from Santangelo et al.
   (2010) to explore the causal interactions between large-scale brain
   networks during divided attention. During fMRI scanning, participants
   monitored streams of visual and/or auditory stimuli in one or two
   spatial locations for detection of occasional targets. This design
   allowed comparing a condition in which participants monitored one
   stimulus/modality (either visual or auditory) in two spatial locations
   vs. a condition in which participants monitored two stimuli/modalities
   (both visual and auditory) in one spatial location. The analysis of the
   independent components (ICs) revealed that dividing attentional
   resources across two spatial locations necessitated a brain network
   involving the left ventro- and dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex plus the
   posterior parietal cortex, including the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and
   the angular gyrus, bilaterally. The analysis of Granger causality
   highlighted that the activity of lateral prefrontal regions were
   predictive of the activity of all of the posteriors parietal nodes. By
   contrast, dividing attention across two sensory modalities necessitated
   a brain network including nodes belonging to the dorsal frontoparietal
   network, i.e., the bilateral frontal eye-fields (FEF) and IPS, plus
   nodes belonging to the salience network, i.e., the anterior cingulated
   cortex and the left and right anterior insular cortex (aIC). The
   analysis of Granger causality highlights a tight interdependence between
   the dorsal frontoparietal and salience nodes in trials requiring divided
   attention between different sensory modalities. The current findings
   therefore highlighted a dissociation among brain networks implicated
   during divided attention across spatial locations and sensory
   modalities, pointing out the importance of investigating effective
   connectivity of largescale brain networks supporting complex behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies indicated that time perspective can affect many
   behaviors, such as decisions, risk taking, substance abuse and health
   behaviors. However, very little is known about the neural substrates of
   time perspective (TP). To address this question, we characterized
   different dimensions of TP (including the Past, Present, and Future TP)
   using standardized Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI), and
   quantified the gray matter volume using voxel-based morphometry (VBM)
   method across two independent samples. Our whole-brain analysis (sample
   1, N = 150) revealed Past-Negative TP was positively correlated with the
   GMV of a cluster in LPFC whereas Past-Positive was negatively correlated
   with the GMV in OFC, and Future TP was negatively correlated with GMV in
   mPFC. Moreover, two present scales (Present-Hedonistic and
   Present-Fatalistic TPs) were positively correlated with the GMV of
   regions in MTG and precuneus, respectively. We further examined the
   reliability of these correlations between multidimensional TPs and
   neuroanatomical structures in another independent sample (sample 2, N =
   58). Results verified our findings that GMV in LPFC could predict Past
   Negative TP while GMV in OFC could predict Past-Positive TP, and the GMV
   in MTG could predict Present Hedonistic while the GMV in presuneus could
   predict Present-Fatalistic, as well as the GMV in mPFC could predict
   Future TP. Thus, our findings suggest that the existence of selective
   neural basis underlying TPs, and further provide the stable biomarkers
   for multidimensional TPs.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Face processing is regularly found to be impaired in schizophrenia (SZ),
   thus suggesting that social malfunctioning might be caused by
   dysfunctional face processing. Most studies focused on emotional face
   processes, whereas non-emotional face processing received less
   attention. While current reports on abnormal face processing in SZ are
   mixed, examinations of non-emotional face processing compared to
   adequate control stimuli may clarify whether SZ is characterized by a
   face-processing deficit. Patients with SZ (n = 28) and healthy controls
   (n = 30) engaged in an fMRI scan where images of non-emotional faces and
   houses were presented. A simple inverted-picture detection task
   warranted the participants' attention. Region of interest (ROI) analyses
   were conducted on face-sensitive regions including the fusiform face
   area, the occipital face area, and the superior temporal sulcus.
   Scene-sensitivity was assessed in the para-hippocampal place area (PPA)
   and served as control condition. Patients did not show aberrant
   face-related neural processes in face-sensitive regions. This finding
   was also evident when analyses were done on individually defined ROIs or
   on in-house-localizer ROIs. Patients revealed a decreased specificity
   toward house stimuli as reflected in decreased neural response toward
   houses in the PPA. Again, this result was supported by supplementary
   analyses. Neural activation toward neutral faces was not found to be
   impaired in SZ, therefore speaking against an overall face-processing
   deficit. Aberrant activation in scene-sensitive PPA is also found in
   assessments of memory processes in SZ. It is up to future studies to
   show how impairments in PPA relate to functional outcome in SZ.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{A self-enhancing humor style (SEHS) plays an important role in the
   regulation of negative emotion through humorous perspective-taking.
   Following the mind-reading theories of humor, we investigated the
   relationship between gray-matter volume (GMV) of brain areas related to
   theory of mind and SEHS in young college students, using voxel-based
   morphometry analysis. We then performed a voxel-wise analysis of
   covariance to assess any moderation effect of cognitive empathy on the
   relationship. Results demonstrated that higher SEHS scores were
   associated with larger GMV of the precuneus in the group with high
   cognitive empathy, but there was no association in the group with low
   cognitive empathy. These results suggest that high cognitive empathy and
   increased precuneus volume can predict greater use of self-enhancing
   humor in young healthy individuals.}},

Title = {{The Neural Basis of Taste-visual Modal Conflict Control in Appetitive
   and Aversive Gustatory Context}},
Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{372}},
Pages = {{154-160}},
Month = {{FEB 21}},
Abstract = {{The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique was used to
   investigate brain activations related to conflict control in a
   taste-visual cross-modal pairing task. On each trial, participants had
   to decide whether the taste of a gustatory stimulus matched or did not
   match the expected taste of the food item depicted in an image. There
   were four conditions: Negative match (NM; sour gustatory stimulus and
   image of sour food), negative mismatch (NMM; sour gustatory stimulus and
   image of sweet food), positive match (PM; sweet gustatory stimulus and
   image of sweet food), positive mismatch (PMM; sweet gustatory stimulus
   and image of sour food). Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)
   contrasts between the NMM and the NM conditions revealed an increased
   activity in the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) (BA 6), the lingual gyrus
   (LG) (BA 18), and the postcentral gyrus. Furthermore, the NMM minus NM
   BOLD differences observed in the MFG were correlated with the NMM minus
   NM differences in response time. These activations were specifically
   associated with conflict control during the aversive gustatory
   stimulation. BOLD contrasts between the PMM and the PM condition
   revealed no significant positive activation, which supported the
   hypothesis that the human brain is especially sensitive to aversive
   stimuli. Altogether, these results suggest that the MFG is associated
   with the taste-visual cross-modal conflict control. A possible role of
   the LG as an information conflict detector at an early perceptual stage
   is further discussed, along with a possible involvement of the
   postcentral gyrus in the processing of the taste-visual cross-modal
   sensory contrast. (C) 2018 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{FEB 20}},
Abstract = {{The current functional MRI study aimed to investigate how responders'
   fairness considerations and related decision-making processes were
   affected by social support in the ultimatum game (UG). During scanning,
   responders either played the standard UG with proposers (control
   condition) or played the modified UG in which three unknown observers
   showed social support for responders by acknowledging proposers' norm
   violation. Results revealed that participants reported higher unfairness
   feelings and rejection rates of unfair offers in the social support
   condition relative to the control condition. At the neural level,
   compared to the control condition, perception of social support from
   others induced greater activations of anterior cingulate gyrus and right
   anterior insula when receiving unfair (vs. fair) offers. The medial
   prefrontal cortex and right anterior insula were more active when the
   unfair offers were rejected (vs. accepted) in the social support
   condition than the control condition. These results highlighted the
   modulation effect of social support on responders' fairness
   considerations and related decision-making processes.}},

   Subregions Predicting Prosocial Consumer Decisions}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{FEB 20}},
Abstract = {{Although it is now well documented that observation by others can be a
   powerful elicitor of prosocial behaviour, the underlying neural
   mechanism is yet to be explored. In the present fMRI study, we
   replicated the previously reported observer effect in ethical
   consumption, in that participants were more likely to purchase social
   products that are sold to support people in need than non-social
   products when being observed by others. fMRI data revealed that the
   anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex
   (dmPFC) encoded subject-specific value parameters of purchase decisions
   for social and non-social products, respectively, under social
   observation. The ACC showed strong functional coupling with the amygdala
   and the anterior insula when participants in the observation condition
   were making purchases of social versus non-social products. Finally,
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity predicted faster
   reaction time and increased prosocial behavior during decisions to
   purchase social versus non-social products, regardless of social
   observation. The present findings suggest that subregions of the mPFC,
   namely the dmPFC, ACC, and vmPFC, are hierarchically organized to encode
   different levels of decision values from the value of context-sensitive
   reputation to that of internalized prosociality.}},

Title = {{Spatial Arrangement and Set Size Influence the Coding of Non-symbolic
   Quantities in the Intraparietal Sulcus}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{FEB 20}},
Abstract = {{Performance in visual quantification tasks shows two characteristic
   patterns as a function of set size. A precise subitizing process for
   small sets (up to four) was contrasted with an approximate estimation
   process for larger sets. The spatial arrangement of elements in a set
   also influences visual quantification performance, with frequently
   perceived arrangements (e.g., dice patterns) being faster enumerated
   than random arrangements. Neuropsychological and imaging studies
   identified the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), as key brain area for
   quantification, both within and above the subitizing range. However, it
   is not yet clear if and how set size and spatial arrangement of elements
   in a set modulate IPS activity during quantification. In an fMRI study,
   participants enumerated briefly presented dot patterns with random,
   canonical or dice arrangement within and above the subitizing range. We
   evaluated how activity amplitude and pattern in the IPS were influenced
   by size and spatial arrangement of a set. We found a discontinuity in
   the amplitude of IPS response between subitizing and estimation range,
   with steep activity increase for sets exceeding four elements. In the
   estimation range, random dot arrangements elicited stronger IPS response
   than canonical arrangements which in turn elicited stronger response
   than dice arrangements. Furthermore, IPS activity patterns differed
   systematically between arrangements. We found a signature in the IPS
   response for a transition between subitizing and estimation processes
   during quantification. Differences in amplitude and pattern of IPS
   activity for different spatial arrangements indicated a more precise
   representation of non-symbolic numerical magnitude for dice and
   canonical than for random arrangements. These findings challenge the
   idea of an abstract coding of numerosity in the IPS even within a single
   notation.}},

Abstract = {{Across species, fears often spread between individuals through social
   learning. Yet, little is known about the neural and computational
   mechanisms underlying social learning. Addressing this question, we
   compared social and direct (Pavlovian) fear learning showing that they
   showed indistinguishable behavioral effects, and involved the same
   cross-modal (self/other) aversive learning network, centered on the
   amygdala, the anterior insula (AI), and the anterior cingulate cortex
   (ACC). Crucially, the information flow within this network differed
   between social and direct fear learning. Dynamic causal modeling
   combined with reinforcement learning modeling revealed that the amygdala
   and AI provided input to this network during direct and social learning,
   respectively. Furthermore, the AI gated learning signals based on
   surprise (associability), which were conveyed to the ACC, in both
   learning modalities. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms
   underlying social fear learning, with implications for understanding
   common psychological dysfunctions, such as phobias and other anxiety

Volume = {{167}},
Pages = {{211-223}},

Abstract = {{It is known that prior knowledge can facilitate memory acquisition. It
   is unclear, however, whether prior knowledge can affect post-encoding
   brain activity to facilitate memory consolidation. In this fMRI study,
   we asked participants to associate novel houses with famous/nonfamous
   faces and investigated how associative-encoding tasks with/without prior
   knowledge differentially affected post-encoding brain connectivity
   during rest. Besides memory advantages in the famous condition, we found
   that post-encoding hippocampal connectivity with the fusiform face area
   (FFA) and ventral-medial-prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was stronger
   following encoding of associations with famous than non-famous faces.
   Importantly, post-encoding functional connectivity between the
   hippocampus (HPC) and FFA, and between the anterior temporal pole region
   (aTPL) and posterior perceptual regions (i.e., FFA and the
   parahippocampal place area), together predicted a large proportion of
   the variance in subsequent memory performance. This prediction was
   specific for face-house associative memory, not face/house item memory,
   and only in the famous condition where prior knowledge was involved.
   These results support the idea that when prior knowledge is involved,
   the HPC, vmPFC, and aTPL, which support prior episodic,
   social-evaluative/schematic, and semantic memories, respectively,
   continue to interact with each other and posterior perceptual brain
   regions during the post-encoding rest to facilitate off-line processing
   of the newly formed memory, and enhance memory consolidation.}},

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is often characterized by atypical
   language profiles and auditory and speech processing. These can
   contribute to aberrant language and social communication skills in ASD.
   The study of the neural basis of speech perception in ASD can serve as a
   potential neurobiological marker of ASD early on, but mixed results
   across studies renders it difficult to find a reliable neural
   characterization of speech processing in ASD. To this aim, the present
   study examined the functional neural basis of speech perception in ASD
   versus typical development (TD) using an activation likelihood
   estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of 18 qualifying studies. The present
   study included separate analyses for TD and ASD, which allowed us to
   examine patterns of within group brain activation as well as both common
   and distinct patterns of brain activation across the ASD and TD groups.
   Overall, ASD and TD showed mostly common brain activation of speech
   processing in bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG) and left inferior
   frontal gyms (IFG). However, the results revealed trends for some
   distinct activation in the TD group showing additional activation in
   higher-order brain areas including left superior frontal gyrus (SFG),
   left medial frontal gyrus (MFG), and right IFG. These results provide a
   more reliable neural characterization of speech processing in ASD
   relative to previous single neuroimaging studies and motivate future
   work to investigate how these brain signatures relate to behavioral
   measures of speech processing in ASD.}},

   Decision Making}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{FEB 13}},
Abstract = {{Gaze direction is a common social cue implying potential interpersonal
   interaction. However, little is known about the neural processing of
   social decision making influenced by perceived gaze direction. Here, we
   employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method to
   investigate 27 females when they were engaging in an economic exchange
   game task during which photos of direct or averted eye gaze were shown.
   We found that, when averted but not direct gaze was presented, prosocial
   vs. selfish choices were associated with stronger activations in the
   right superior temporal gyrus (STG) as well as larger functional
   couplings between right STG and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC).
   Moreover, stronger activations in right STG was associated with quicker
   actions for making prosocial choice accompanied with averted gaze. The
   findings suggest that, when the cue implying social contact is absent,
   the processing of understanding others' intention and the relationship
   between self and others is more involved for making prosocial than
   selfish decisions. These findings could advance our understanding of the
   roles of subtle cues in influencing prosocial decision making, as well
   as shedding lights on deficient social cue processing and functioning
   among individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).}},

Abstract = {{Romantic love is a cross-culturally universal phenomenon that serves as
   a commitment device for motivating pair bonding in human beings. Women
   and men may experience different feelings when viewing the same warm,
   romantic scenes. To determine which brain systems may be involved in
   romance perception and examine possible sex differences, we scanned 16
   women and 16 men who were intensely in love, using functional MRI.
   Participants were required to rate the romance level of 60 pictures
   showing romantic events that may frequently occur during romantic
   relationship formation. The results showed that greater brain activation
   was found for men in the insula, PCC (posterior cingulate cortex), and
   prefrontal gyrus compared with women, primarily under the High-romance
   condition. In addition, enhanced functional connectivity between the
   brain regions involved in the High-romance condition in contrast to the
   Low-romance condition was only found for men. These data suggest that
   men and women differ in the processing of romantic information and that
   it may be more effortful for men to perceive and evaluate romance

Title = {{Classification of Autism Spectrum Disorder Using Random Support Vector
   Machine Cluster}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN GENETICS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{FEB 6}},
Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is mainly reflected in the communication
   and language barriers, difficulties in social communication, and it is a
   kind of neurological developmental disorder. Most researches have used
   the machine learning method to classify patients and normal controls,
   among which support vector machines (SVM) are widely employed. But the
   classification accuracy of SVM is usually low, due to the usage of a
   single SVM as classifier. Thus, we used multiple SVMs to classify ASD
   patients and typical controls (TC). Resting-state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) data of 46 TC and 61 ASD patients were obtained
   from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database. Only 84 of
   107 subjects are utilized in experiments because the translation or
   rotation of 7 TC and 16 ASD patients has surpassed 2 mm or 2. Then the
   random SVM cluster was proposed to distinguish TC and ASD. The results
   show that this method has an excellent classification performance based
   on all the features. Furthermore, the accuracy based on the optimal
   feature set could reach to 96.15\%. Abnormal brain regions could also be
   found, such as inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) (orbital and opercula part),
   hippocampus, and precuneus. It is indicated that the method of random
   SVM cluster may apply to the auxiliary diagnosis of ASD.}},

Abstract = {{Facial mimicry (FM) is an automatic response to imitate the facial
   expressions of others. However, neural correlates of the phenomenon are
   as yet not well established. We investigated this issue using
   simultaneously recorded EMG and BOLD signals during perception of
   dynamic and static emotional facial expressions of happiness and anger.
   During display presentations, BOLD signals and zygomaticus major (ZM),
   corrugator supercilii (CS) and orbicularis oculi (00) EMG responses were
   recorded simultaneously from 46 healthy individuals. Subjects reacted
   spontaneously to happy facial expressions with increased EMG activity in
   ZM and 00 muscles and decreased CS activity, which was interpreted as
   FM. Facial muscle responses correlated with BOLD activity in regions
   associated with motor simulation of facial expressions {[}i.e., inferior
   frontal gyrus, a classical Mirror Neuron System (MNS)]. Further, we also
   found correlations for regions associated with emotional processing
   (i.e., insula, part of the extended MNS). It is concluded that FM
   involves both motor and emotional brain structures, especially during
   perception of natural emotional expressions.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{FEB 5}},
Abstract = {{Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder with dimensional behavioral
   symptoms and various damages in the structural and functional brain.
   Previous neuroimaging studies focused on exploring the differences of
   brain development between individuals with and without autism spectrum
   disorders (ASD). However, few of them have attempted to investigate the
   individual differences of the brain features among subjects within the
   Autism spectrum. Our main goal was to explore the individual differences
   of neurodevelopment in young children with Autism by testing for the
   association between the functional network efficiency and levels of
   autistic behaviors, as well as the association between the functional
   network efficiency and age. Forty-six children with Autism (ages 2.0-8.9
   years old) participated in the current study, with levels of autistic
   behaviors evaluated by their parents. The network efficiency (global and
   local network efficiency) were obtained from the functional networks
   based on the oxy-, deoxy-, and total-Hemoglobin series, respectively.
   Results indicated that the network efficiency decreased with age in
   young children with Autism in the deoxy-and
   total-Hemoglobin-based-networks, and children with a relatively higher
   level of autistic behaviors showed decreased network efficiency in the
   oxy-hemoglobin-based network. Results suggest individual differences of
   brain development in young children within the Autism spectrum,
   providing new insights into the psychopathology of ASD.}},

Title = {{How Do Acquired Political Identities Influence Our Neural Processing
   toward Others within the Context of a Trust Game?}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{FEB 2}},
Abstract = {{Trust is essential for mutually beneficial human interactions in
   economic exchange and politics and people's social identities notably
   have dramatic effects on trust behaviors toward others. Previous
   literature concerning social identities generally suggests that people
   tend to show in-group favoritism toward members who share the same
   identity. However, how our brains process signals of identity while
   facing uncertain situations in interpersonal interactions remains
   largely unclear. To address this issue, we performed an fMRI experiment
   with 54 healthy adults who belonged to two identity groups of opposing
   political orientations. The identity information of participants was
   extracted from a large-scale social survey on the 2012 Taiwan
   presidential election. Accordingly, participants were categorized as
   either the Kuomintang (KMT) or the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
   supporters. During the experiment, participants played trust games with
   computer agents with labels of the same or the opposing political
   identity. Interestingly, our results suggest that the behaviors of the
   two groups cannot be equally attributed to in-group favoritism.
   Behaviorally, only the DPP supporter group showed a significant trust
   preference toward in-group members, which did not hold for the KMT
   supporter group. Consistently, neurophysiological findings further
   revealed that only the DPP supporter group showed neuronal responses to
   both unexpected negative feedback from in-group members in anterior
   insula, temporoparietal junction, and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex,
   as well as to unexpected rewards from out-group members in caudate.
   These findings therefore suggest that acquired identities play a more
   complex role in modulating people's social expectation in interpersonal
   trust behaviors under identity-relevant contexts.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Typically, about 30 to 50\% of adolescents with depression
   fail to respond to evidence-based treatments, including antidepressant
   medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
   Efforts for identifying predictors and moderators of treatment response
   are needed to begin to address critical questions relevant to
   personalized care in adolescent depression. In this pilot study, we aim
   to identify biological predictors of response to antidepressant
   treatment.
   Method: We used a multiple levels of analysis approach to evaluate
   threat system functioning (fronto-limbic system and the associated
   hormonal cascade) to determine if key biological indexes at baseline
   could predict improvement in depressive symptoms after eight weeks of
   antidepressant treatment in adolescents with depression.
   Results: Neural predictors of favorable treatment response included
   lower amygdala connectivity with left supplementary motor area and with
   right precentral gyrus, and greater amygdala connectivity with right
   central opercular cortex and Heschl's gyrus connectivity during rest.
   During an emotion task, neural predictors of treatment response were
   greater activation of the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex and left
   medial frontal gyrus. Additionally, different patterns of salivary
   cortisol obtained in the context of a modified Trier Social Stress Test
   were associated with those whose depressive symptoms remitted as
   compared to those whose symptoms persisted.
   Conclusions: This approach shows significant promise for identifying
   predictors of treatment response in adolescents with depression. Future
   work is needed that incorporates sufficiently powered, randomized
   control trials to provide the basis by which both predictors and
   moderators of treatment response are identified. The hope is that this
   work will inform the development of methods that can guide clinician
   decision-making in assigning beneficial treatments for adolescents who
   are suffering from depression.}},

Journal = {{NEUROBIOLOGY OF STRESS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{186-201}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Experimental imaging studies on the effects of acute stress have
   revealed functional changes in the amygdalae, hippocampi and medial
   frontal cortices. However, much less is known about the association
   between perceived stress and neurological function which may have
   implications for the development of stress related disorders.
   Participants completed a working-memory task and an inhibition task
   whilst undergoing a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan.
   Task related and resting-state fMRI data from 22 women and 24 men were
   analysed to investigate changes in task activations and functional
   connectivity associated with perceived stress over the past month.
   Analyses were stratified by gender due to gender differences in the
   stress response. Stress was associated with faster working memory
   response time in women, but not men. Stress was not associated with any
   differences in task activations in either gender. There were many
   significant associations between stress and connectivity: findings in
   women were consistent with increased emotional regulation; men exhibited
   decreases in connectivity between affective processing areas during the
   tasks and showed no relation between perceived stress and resting-state
   connectivity; very few of the within gender differences were
   significantly different between gender. Dysregulated connectivity
   between areas involved in the neural stress response and
   self-referential thoughts (e.g. the default mode network) suggests that
   perceived stress may have a subtle impact on cognitive processing and
   neural correlates. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Parents' emotional functioning represents a central mechanism in the
   caregiving environment's influence on adolescent affective brain
   function. However, a paucity of research has examined links between
   parental emotional arousal and regulation and adolescents' affective
   brain function. Thus, the present study examined associations between
   parents' self-rated negative emotion, parent emotion regulation
   difficulties, and adolescent brain responsivity to negative and positive
   emotional stimuli. Participants included 64 12-14 year-old adolescents
   (31 females) and their female primary caregivers. Adolescents viewed
   negative, positive, and neutral emotional stimuli during an fMRI
   scanning session. Region of interest analyses showed that higher parent
   negative emotion was related to adolescents' greater ACC and vmPFC
   response to both negatively- and positively-valenced emotional stimuli;
   whereas, parent negative emotion was related to adolescents' greater
   amygdala response to negative emotional stimuli only. Furthermore,
   parent emotion regulation moderated the association between parent
   negative emotion and adolescents' brain response to negative emotional
   stimuli, such that parents with high negative emotion and high emotion
   regulation difficulties had adolescents with the greatest affective
   brain response. Findings highlight the importance of considering both
   parent emotional arousal and regulation in understanding the family
   affective environment and its relation to adolescent emotion-related
   brain development.}},

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have found that individuals with autism spectrum
   disorders show impairments in mentalizing processes and aberrant brain
   activity compared with typically developing participants. However, the
   findings are mainly from male participants and the aberrant effects in
   autism spectrum disorder females and sex differences are still unclear.
   To address these issues, this study analyzed intrinsic functional
   connectivity of mentalizing regions using resting-state functional
   magnetic resonance imaging data of 48 autism spectrum disorder males and
   females and 48 typically developing participants in autism brain imaging
   data exchange. Whole-brain analyses showed that autism spectrum disorder
   males had hyperconnectivity in functional connectivity of the bilateral
   temporal-parietal junction, whereas autism spectrum disorder females
   showed hypoconnectivity in functional connectivity of the medial
   prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and right temporal-parietal junction.
   Interaction between sex and autism was found in both short- and
   long-distance functional connectivity effects, confirming that autism
   spectrum disorder males showed overconnectivity, while autism spectrum
   disorder females showed underconnectivity. Furthermore, a regression
   analysis revealed that in autism spectrum disorder, males and females
   demonstrated different relations between the functional connectivity
   effects of the mentalizing regions and the core autism spectrum disorder
   deficits. These results suggest sex differences in the mentalizing
   network in autism spectrum disorder individuals. Future work is needed
   to examine how sex interacts with other factors such as age and the sex
   differences during mentalizing task performance.}},

Abstract = {{Sleep plays an important role for successful fear memory consolidation.
   Growing evidence suggests that sleep disturbances might contribute to
   the development and the maintenance of posttraumatic stress disorder
   (PTSD), a disorders characterized by dysregulations in fear learning
   mechanisms, as well as exaggerated arousal and salience processing.
   Against this background, the present study examined the effects of sleep
   deprivation (SD) on the acquisition of fear and the subsequent neural
   consolidation. To this end, the present study assessed fear acquisition
   and associated changes in fMRI-based amygdala-functional connectivity
   following 24 h of SD. Relative to non-sleep deprived controls, SD
   subjects demonstrated increased fear ratings and skin conductance
   responses (SCR) during fear acquisition. During fear consolidation SD
   inhibited increased amygdala-ventromendial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)
   connectivity and concomitantly increased changes in amygdala-insula
   connectivity. Importantly, whereas in controls fear indices during
   acquisition were negatively associated with amygdala-vmPFC connectivity
   during consolidation, fear indices were positively associated with
   amygdala-insula coupling following SD. Together the findings suggest
   that SD may interfere with vmPFC control of the amygdala and increase
   bottom-up arousal signaling in the amygdala-insula pathway during fear
   consolidation, which might mediate the negative impact of sleep
   disturbances on PSTD symptomatology.}},

Abstract = {{The capacity to adaptively respond to negative emotion is in part
   dependent upon lateral areas of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Lateral PFC
   areas are particularly susceptible to age-related atrophy, which affects
   executive function (EF). We used structural and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) to test the hypothesis that older age is
   associated with greater medial PFC engagement during processing of
   negative information, and that this engagement is dependent upon the
   integrity of grey matter structure in lateral PFC as well as EF.
   Participants (n = 64, 38-79 years) viewed negative and neutral scenes
   while in the scanner, and completed cognitive tests as part of a larger
   study. Grey matter probability (GMP) was computed to index grey matter
   integrity. FMRI data demonstrated less activity in the left
   ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC) and greater ventromedial PFC (VMPFC) activity
   with increasing age during negative-picture viewing. Age did not
   correlate with amygdala responding. GMP in VLPFC and EF were negatively
   associated with VMPFC activity. We conclude that this change from
   lateral to medial PFC engagement in response to picture-induced negative
   affect reflects decreased reliance on executive function-related
   processes, possibly associated with reduced grey matter in lateral PFC,
   with advancing age to maintain emotional functioning.}},

Abstract = {{While prior work has demonstrated that fear-conditioning changes the
   neural representation of previously neutral stimuli, it remains unknown
   to what extent this new representation abstracts away from specific
   fears and which brain areas are involved therein. To investigate this
   question, we sought commonalities between experimentally-induced fear
   via electric shocks and pre-existing phobia. Using functional MRI, we
   tested the effect of fear-conditioning pictures of dogs in 21
   spider-fearful participants across three phases: baseline,
   post-conditioning, and extinction. Considering phobic stimuli as a
   reference point for the state of fear allowed us to examine whether
   fear-conditioning renders information patterns of previously neutral
   stimuli more similar to those of phobic stimuli. We trained a
   classification algorithm to discriminate information patterns of neutral
   stimuli (rats) and phobic stimuli and then tested the algorithm on
   information patterns from the conditioned stimuli (dogs). Performing
   this cross-decoding analysis at each experimental phase revealed brain
   regions in which dogs were classified as rats during baseline, as
   spiders following conditioning, and again as rats after extinction. A
   follow-up analysis showed that changes in visual perception information
   cannot explain the changing classification performance. These results
   demonstrate a common neural representation for processing fear-eliciting
   information, either pre-existing or acquired by classical conditioning.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals react differently to social experiences; for example, people
   who are more sensitive to negative social experiences, such as being
   excluded, may be more likely to adapt their behavior to fit in with
   others. We examined whether functional brain connectivity during social
   exclusion in the fMRI scanner can be used to predict subsequent
   conformity to peer norms. Adolescent males (n = 57) completed a two-part
   study on teen driving risk: a social exclusion task (Cyberball) during
   an fMRI session and a subsequent driving simulator session in which they
   drove alone and in the presence of a peer who expressed risk-averse or
   risk-accepting driving norms. We computed the difference in functional
   connectivity between social exclusion and social inclusion from each
   node in the brain to nodes in two brain networks, one previously
   associated with mentalizing (medial prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal
   junction, precuneus, temporal poles) and another with social pain
   (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula). Using predictive
   modeling, this measure of global connectivity during exclusion predicted
   the extent of conformity to peer pressure during driving in the
   subsequent experimental session. These findings extend our understanding
   of how global neural dynamics guide social behavior, revealing
   functional network activity that captures individual differences.}},

Abstract = {{The personality dimensions of neuroticism and extraversion are strongly
   associated with emotional experience and affective disorders. Previous
   studies reported functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity
   correlates of these traits, but no study has used brain-based measures
   to predict them. Here, using a fully cross-validated approach, we
   predict novel individuals' neuroticism and extraversion from functional
   connectivity (FC) data observed as they simply rested during fMRI
   scanning. We applied a data-driven technique, connectome-based
   predictive modeling (CPM), to resting-state FC data and neuroticism and
   extraversion scores (self-reported NEO Five Factor Inventory) from 114
   participants of the Nathan Kline Institute Rockland sample. After
   dividing the whole brain into 268 nodes using a predefined functional
   atlas, we defined each individual's FC matrix as the set of correlations
   between the activity timecourses of every pair of nodes. CPM identified
   networks consisting of functional connections correlated with
   neuroticism and extraversion scores, and used strength in these networks
   to predict a left-out individual's scores. CPM predicted neuroticism and
   extraversion in novel individuals, demonstrating that patterns in
   resting-state FC reveal trait-level measures of personality. CPM also
   revealed predictive networks that exhibit some anatomical patterns
   consistent with past studies and potential new brain areas of interest
   in personality.}},

Abstract = {{Facial expressions and voice modulations are among the most important
   communicational signals to convey emotional information. The ability to
   correctly interpret this information is highly relevant for successful
   social interaction and represents an integral component of emotional
   competencies that have been conceptualized under the term emotional
   intelligence. Here, we investigated the relationship of emotional
   intelligence as measured with the
   Salovey-Caruso-Emotional-Intelligence-Test (MSCEIT) with cerebral voice
   and face processing using functional and structural magnetic resonance
   imaging. MSCEIT scores were positively correlated with increased
   voice-sensitivity and gray matter volume of the insula accompanied by
   voice-sensitivity enhanced connectivity between the insula and the
   temporal voice area, indicating generally increased salience of voices.
   Conversely, in the face processing system, higher MSCEIT scores were
   associated with decreased face-sensitivity and gray matter volume of the
   fusiform face area. Taken together, these findings point to an
   alteration in the balance of cerebral voice and face processing systems
   in the form of an attenuated face-vs-voice bias as one potential factor
   underpinning emotional intelligence.}},

Abstract = {{The late positive potential (LPP) and fMRI blood-oxygen-level dependent
   (BOLD) activity can provide complementary measures of the processing of
   affective and social stimuli. Separate lines of research using these
   measures have often employed the same stimuli, paradigms, and samples;
   however, there remains relatively little understanding of the way in
   which individual differences in one of these measures relates to the
   other, and all prior research has been conducted in psychiatrically
   healthy samples and using emotional scenes (not faces). Here, 32
   combat-exposed U.S. military veterans with varying levels of
   posttraumatic stress symptomatology viewed affective social stimuli
   (angry, fearful, and happy faces) and geometric shapes during separate
   EEG and fMRI BOLD recordings. Temporospatial principal component
   analysis was used to quantify the face-elicited LPP in a data-driven
   manner, prior to conducting whole-brain correlations between resulting
   positivities and fMRI BOLD elicited by faces. Participants with larger
   positivities to fearful faces (> shapes) showed increased activation in
   the amygdala; larger positivities to angry and happy faces (> shapes)
   were associated with increased BOLD activation in the posterior fusiform
   gyrus and inferior temporal gyrus, respectively. Across all face types,
   larger positivities were associated with increased activation in the
   fusiform ``face{''} area. Correlations using mean area amplitude LPPs
   showed an association with increased activation in the anterior insula
   for angry faces (> shapes). LPP-BOLD associations were not moderated by
   PTSD. Findings provide the first evidence of correspondence between
   face-elicited LPP and BOLD activation across a range of (normal to
   disordered) psychiatric health.}},

Title = {{Schizophrenia patients have higher-order language and extralinguistic
   impairments}},
Journal = {{SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{192}},
Pages = {{274-280}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: The extralinguistic and paralinguistic aspects of the
   language refer to higher-order language functions such as
   lexical-semantic processes, prosody, indirect speech acts or discourse
   comprehension and production. Studies suggest that these processes are
   mediated by the Right Hemisphere (RH) and there is also some evidence of
   RH dysfunctions in schizophrenia. The aim of the paper is to investigate
   the extralinguistic and para-linguistic processing mediated by Right
   Hemisphere in schizophrenia patients using a validated and standardized
   battery of tests.
   Methods: Two groups of participants were examined: a schizophrenia
   sample (40 participants) and a control group (39 participants).
   Extralinguistic and paralinguistic processing was assessed in all
   subjects by the Polish version of the Right Hemisphere Language Battery
   (RHLB-PL), which measures comprehension of implicit information, naming,
   understanding humor, inappropriate remarks and comments, explanation and
   understanding of metaphors, understanding emotional and language prosody
   and discourse understanding.
   Results: Schizophrenia patients scored significantly lower than controls
   in subtests measuring comprehension of implicit information,
   interpretation of humor, explanation of metaphors, inappropriate remarks
   and comments, discernment of emotional and language prosody and
   comprehension of discourse. No differences were observed in naming,
   understanding metaphors or in processing visuo-spatial information.
   Conclusions: Extralinguistic and paralinguistic dysfunctions appear to
   be present in schizophrenia patients and they suggest that RH processing
   may be disturbed in that group of patients. As the disturbances of
   higher-order language processes mediated by the RH may cause serious
   impairments in the social communication of patients, it is worth
   evaluating them during clinical examination. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Advertisements featuring celebrities have increased over the years.
   While we know that the effectiveness of celebrities stems from a
   transfer of positive affect from celebrity to product, it is still
   unclear whether celebrities are also able to improve product
   favorableness in commercials. In the current study, by employing a
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment that presented
   subjects with a combination of a celebrity face and a car that was
   familiar to their culture, we investigated the neural correlates of
   celebrity power on car favorableness in advertising. The results showed
   that neural activity in brain areas associated with reward, memory,
   semantics, and attention was higher when viewing a combination of a
   celebrity face and a car compared to viewing a combination of a
   non-celebrity face and a car. Furthermore, it was found that the scores
   of car favorableness were positively correlated with neural activity of
   left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), left anterior insula and left
   higher-order visual cortex in the occipital lobe. This suggests a
   possible ``transfer effect{''} of positive attitude, and a feeling for
   the celebrity, while making a preference-judgment for car.}},

Abstract = {{Stimuli that capture the central tendency of presented exemplars are
   often preferred-a phenomenon also known as the classic
   beauty-in-averageness effect. However, recent studies have shown that
   this effect can reverse under certain conditions. We propose that a key
   variable for such ugliness-in-averageness effects is the category
   structure of the presented exemplars. When exemplars cluster into
   multiple subcategories, the global average should no longer reflect the
   underlying stimulus distributions, and will thereby become unattractive.
   In contrast, the subcategory averages (i.e., local averages) should
   better reflect the stimulus distributions, and become more attractive.
   In 3 studies, we presented participants with dot patterns belonging to 2
   different subcategories. Importantly, across studies, we also
   manipulated the distinctiveness of the subcategories. We found that
   participants preferred the local averages over the global average when
   they first learned to classify the patterns into 2 different
   subcategories in a contrastive categorization paradigm (Experiment 1).
   Moreover, participants still preferred local averages when first
   classifying patterns into a single category (Experiment 2) or when not
   classifying patterns at all during incidental learning (Experiment 3),
   as long as the subcategories were sufficiently distinct. Finally, as a
   proof-of-concept, we mapped our empirical results onto predictions
   generated by a well-known computational model of category learning (the
   Generalized Context Model {[}GCM]). Overall, our findings emphasize the
   key role of categorization for understanding the nature of preferences,
   including any effects that emerge from stimulus averaging.}},

Abstract = {{Although the majority of our social interactions are with people we
   know, few studies have investigated the neural correlates of sharing
   valuable resources with familiar others. Using an ecologically valid
   research paradigm, this functional magnetic resonance imaging study
   examined the neural correlates of prosocial and selfish behavior in
   interactions with real-life friends and disliked peers in young adults.
   Participants (N = 27) distributed coins between themselves and another
   person, where they could make selfish choices that maximized their own
   gains or prosocial choices that maximized outcomes of the other.
   Participants were more prosocial toward friends and more selfish toward
   disliked peers. Individual prosociality levels toward friends were
   associated negatively with supplementary motor area and anterior insula
   activity. Further preliminary analyses showed that prosocial decisions
   involving friends were associated with heightened activity in the
   bilateral posterior temporoparietal junction, and selfish decisions
   involving disliked peers were associated with heightened superior
   temporal sulcus activity, which are brain regions consistently shown to
   be involved in mentalizing and perspective taking in prior studies.
   Further, activation of the putamen was observed during prosocial choices
   involving friends and selfish choices involving disliked peers. These
   findings provide insights into the modulation of neural processes that
   underlie prosocial behavior as a function of a positive or negative
   relationship with the interaction partner.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Sexual objectification is a widespread phenomenon characterized by a
   focus on the individuals physical appearance over his/her mental state.
   This has been associated with negative social consequences, as
   objectified individuals are judged to be less human, competent, and
   moral. Moreover, behavioral responses toward the person change as a
   function of the degree of the perceived sexual objectification. In the
   present study, we investigated how behavioral and neural representations
   of other social pain are modulated by the degree of sexual
   objectification of the target. Using a within-subject fMRI design, we
   found reduced empathic feelings for positive (but not negative) emotions
   toward sexually objectified women as compared to non-objectified
   (personalized) women when witnessing their participation to a
   ball-tossing, game. At the brain level, empathy for social exclusion of
   personalized women recruited areas coding the affective component of
   pain (i.e., anterior insula and cingulate cortex), the somatosensory
   components of pain (i.e., posterior insula and secondary somatosensory
   cortex) together with the mentalizing network (i.e., middle frontal
   cortex) to a greater extent than for the sexually objectified women.
   This diminished empathy is discussed in light of the gender-based
   violence that is afflicting the modern society. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Impaired facial affect recognition (FAR) is observed in schizophrenia
   and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and has been linked to amygdala and
   fusiform gyrus dysfunction. ASD patients impairments seem to be more
   pronounced during implicit rather than explicit FAR, whereas for
   schizophrenia data are inconsistent. However, there are no studies
   comparing both patient groups in an identical design. The aim of this
   three-group study was to identify (i) whether FAR alterations are
   equally present in both groups, (ii) whether they are present rather
   during implicit or explicit FAR, (iii) and whether they are conveyed by
   similar or disorder-specific neural mechanisms. Using fMRI, we
   investigated neural activation during explicit and implicit negative and
   neutral FAR in 33 young-adult individuals with ASD, 20 subjects with
   paranoid schizophrenia and 25 IQ- and gender-matched controls
   individuals. Differences in activation patterns between each clinical
   group and controls, respectively were found exclusively for implicit FAR
   in amygdala and fusiform gyrus. In addition, the ASD group additionally
   showed reduced activations in medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), bilateral
   dorso-lateral PFC, ventrolateral PFC, posterior-superior temporal sulcus
   and left temporo-parietal junction. Although subjects with ASD showed
   more widespread altered activation patterns, a direct comparison between
   both patient groups did not show disorder-specific deficits in neither
   patient group. In summary, our findings are consistent with a common
   neural deficit during implicit negative facial affect recognition in
   schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. and

Abstract = {{The prediction of emotion has been explored in a variety of functional
   brain imaging and neurophysiological studies. However, an overall
   picture of the areas involved this process remains unexploited. Here, we
   quantitatively summarized the published literature on emotional
   prediction using activation likelihood estimation (ALE) in functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Furthermore, the current study
   employed a meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) to map the
   meta-analytic coactivation maps of regions of interest (ROIs). Our ALE
   analysis revealed significant convergent activations in some vital brain
   areas involved in emotional prediction, including the dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC),
   orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). For the
   MACM analysis, we identified that the DLPFC, VLPFC and OFC were the core
   areas in the coactivation network of emotional prediction. Overall, the
   results of ALE and MACM indicated that prefrontal brain areas play
   critical roles in emotional prediction.}},

Abstract = {{Our recent functional magnetic resonance imaging study revealed
   decreased activities in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and

   aforementioned activities are common for women and men and explored
   potential gender differences. We scanned twenty males while they
   performed a color-naming task on death-related, negative-valence, and
   neutral-valence words. Whole-brain analysis showed increased left
   frontal activity and decreased activities in the ACC and bilateral
   insula to death-related versus negative-valence words for both men and
   women. However, relative to women, men showed greater increased activity
   in the left middle frontal cortex and decreased activity in the right
   cerebellum to death-related versus negative-valence words. The results
   suggest, while implicit processing of death-related words is
   characterized with weakened sense of oneself for both women and men, men
   may recruit stronger cognitive regulation of emotion than women.}},

Abstract = {{Current neural models of value-based decision-making consider choices as
   a 2-stage process, proceeding from the ``valuation{''} of each option
   under consideration to the ``selection{''} of the best option on the
   basis of their subjective values. However, little is known about the
   computational mechanisms at play at the selection stage and its
   implementation in the human brain. Here, we used drift-diffusion models
   combined with model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging,
   effective connectivity, and multivariate pattern analysis to
   characterize the neuro-computational architecture of value-based
   decisions. We found that 2 key drift-diffusion computations at the
   selection stage, namely integration and choice readout, engage distinct
   brain regions, with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex integrating a
   decision value signal computed in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
   and the posterior parietal cortex reading out choice outcomes. Our
   findings suggest that this prefronto-parietal network acts as a hub
   implementing behavioral selection through a distributed drift-diffusion
   process.}},

Title = {{Sustained opioid antagonism modulates striatal sensitivity to baby
   schema in opioid use disorder}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{70-77}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background: Chronic opioid misuse is associated with reduced sensitivity
   to natural rewards and social motivation deficits that include impaired
   caregiving. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying these deficits and
   their response to treatment are not well understood. Baby schema
   (Kindchenschema) is a set of juvenile physical features, which is
   perceived as ``cute{''} and triggers motivation for caregiving. Recent
   studies suggest that the ``baby schema effect{''} is mediated by the
   brain ``reward{''} network. We studied the impact of opioid antagonist
   treatment on the baby schema response in patients with opioid use
   disorder.
   Methods: Forty-seven (24 F) recently detoxified patients with opioid use
   disorder underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while
   viewing infant portraits that were parametrically manipulated for baby
   schema content and rating them for cuteness, at baseline and during
   treatment with the injectable extended release opioid antagonist
   naltrexone (XRNTX). The study was not placebo-controlled.
   Results: The behavioral effect of baby schema, indexed by ``cuteness{''}
   ratings, was present and unaffected by XRNTX. The brain response to baby
   schema was absent at baseline, but present in the bilateral ventral
   striatum after two weeks of XRNTX treatment. The decline in
   self-reported craving for opioids was positively correlated with the
   brain fMRI response to baby schema in the bilateral ventral striatum.
   Conclusions: Opioid antagonist treatment modulated the brain reward
   system response to a marker of caregiving motivation in patients with
   opioid use disorder. Neural response to baby schema may offer a novel
   probe of social motivation and affiliative behaviors in this population.

Abstract = {{Better understanding the psychological factors related to certainty in
   one's beliefs (i.e., dogmatism) has important consequences for both
   individuals and social groups. Generally, beliefs can find support from
   at least two different routes of information processing: social/moral
   considerations or analytic/empirical reasoning. Here, we investigate how
   these two psychological constructs relate to dogmatism in two groups of
   individuals who preferentially draw on the former or latter sort of
   information when forming beliefs about the world-religious and
   nonreligious individuals. Across two studies and their pooled analysis,
   we provide evidence that although dogmatism is negatively related to
   analytic reasoning in both groups of individuals, it shares a divergent
   relationship with measures of moral concern depending on whether one
   identifies as religious or not. Study 1 showed that increasing levels of
   dogmatism were positively related to prosocial intentions among the
   religious and negatively related to empathic concern among the
   nonreligious. Study 2 replicated and extended these results by showing
   that perspective taking is negatively related to dogmatism in both
   groups, an effect which is particularly robust among the nonreligious.
   Study 2 also showed that religious fundamentalism was positively related
   to measures of moral concern among the religious. Because the current
   studies used a content-neutral measure to assess dogmatic certainty in
   one's beliefs, they have the potential to inform practices for most
   effectively communicating with and persuading religious and nonreligious
   individuals to change maladaptive behavior, even when the mode of
   discourse is unrelated to religious belief.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanisms linking ovarian hormones to negative affect are poorly
   characterized, but important clues may come from the examination of the
   brain's intrinsic organization. Here, we studied the effects of both the
   menstrual cycle and oral contraceptives (OCs) on amygdala and salience
   network resting-state functional connectivity using a double-blind,
   randomized, and placebo-controlled design. Hormone levels, depressive
   symptoms, and resting-state functional connectivity were measured in 35
   healthy women (24.9 +/- 4.2 years) who had previously experienced
   OC-related negative affect. All participants were examined in the
   follicular phase of a baseline cycle and in the third week of the
   subsequent cycle during treatment with either a combined OC (30 mu g
   ethinyl estradiol/0.15 mg levonorgestrel) or placebo. The latter time
   point targeted the midluteal phase in placebo users and steady-state
   ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel concentrations in OC users.
   Amygdala and salience network connectivity generally increased with both
   higher endogenous and synthetic hormone levels, although
   amygdala-parietal cortical connectivity decreased in OC users. When in
   the luteal phase, the naturally cycling placebo users demonstrated
   higher connectivity in both networks compared with the women receiving
   OCs. Our results support a causal link between the exogenous
   administration of synthetic hormones and amygdala and salience network
   connectivity. Furthermore, they suggest a similar, potentially stronger,
   association between the natural hormonal variations across the menstrual
   cycle and intrinsic network connectivity.}},

Abstract = {{Attachment experiences substantially influence emotional and cognitive
   development. Narratives comprising attachment-dependent content were
   proposed to modulate activation of cognitive-emotional schemata in
   listeners. We studied the effects after listening to prototypical
   attachment narratives on wellbeing and countertransference-reactions in
   149 healthy participants. Neural correlates of these cognitive-emotional
   schema activations were investigated in a 7 Tesla rest-task-rest
   fMRI-study (23 healthy males) using functional connectivity (FC)
   analysis of the social approach network (seed regions: left and right
   Caudate Nucleus, CN). Reduced FC between left CN and bilateral
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) represented a general effect of
   prior auditory stimulation. After presentation of the
   insecure-dismissing narrative, FC between left CN and bilateral
   temporo-parietal junction, and right dorsal posterior Cingulum was
   reduced, compared to baseline. Post-narrative FC-patterns of
   insecure-dismissing and insecure-preoccupied narratives differed in
   strength between left CN and right DLPFC. Neural correlates of the
   moderating effect of individual attachment anxiety were represented in a
   reduced CN-DLPFC FC as a function of individual neediness-levels. These
   findings suggest specific neural processing of prolonged mood-changes
   and schema activation induced by attachment-specific speech patterns.
   Individual desire for interpersonal proximity was predicted by
   attachment anxiety and furthermore modulated FC of the social approach
   network in those exposed to such narratives.}},

Abstract = {{Social norms have a critical role in everyday decision-making, as
   frequent interaction with others regulates our behavior. Neuroimaging
   studies show that social-based and fairness-related decision-making
   activates an inconsistent set of areas, which sometimes includes the
   anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and others lateral
   prefrontal cortices. Social-based decision-making is complex and
   variability in findings may be driven by socio-cognitive activities
   related to social norms. To distinguish among social-cognitive
   activities related to social norms, we identified 36 eligible articles
   in the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) literature, which we
   separate into two categories (a) social norm representation and (b) norm
   violations. The majority of original articles (>60\%) used tasks
   associated with fairness norms and decision-making, such as ultimatum
   game, dictator game, or prisoner's dilemma; the rest used tasks
   associated to violation of moral norms, such as scenarios and sentences
   of moral depravity ratings. Using quantitative metaanalyses, we report
   common and distinct brain areas that show concordance as a function of
   category. Specifically, concordance in ventromedial prefrontal regions
   is distinct to social norm representation processing, whereas
   concordance in right insula, dorsolateral prefrontal, and dorsal
   cingulate cortices is distinct to norm violation processing. We propose
   a neurocognitive model of social norms for healthy adults, which could
   help guide future research in social norm compliance and mechanisms of
   its enforcement.}},

Abstract = {{In this review we focus on the exciting new opportunities in comparative
   neuroscience to study neural processes of vocal social perception by
   comparing dog and human neural activity using fMRI methods. The dog is a
   relatively new addition to this research area; however, it has a large
   potential to become a standard species in such investigations. Although
   there has been great interest in the emergence of human language
   abilities, in case of fMRI methods, most research to date focused on
   homologue comparisons within Primates. By belonging to a very different
   clade of mammalian evolution, dogs could give such research agendas a
   more general mammalian foundation. In addition, broadening the scope of
   investigations into vocal communication in general can also deepen our
   understanding of human vocal skills. Being selected for and living in an
   anthropogenic environment, research with dogs may also be informative
   about the way in which human non-linguistic and linguistic signals are
   represented in a mammalian brain without skills for language production.}},

Title = {{The influence of perceptual similarity and individual differences on
   false memories in aging}},
Journal = {{NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{221-230}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Previous false memory research has suggested that older adults' false
   memories are based on an over-reliance on gist processing in the absence
   of item-specific details. Yet, false memory studies have rarely taken
   into consideration the precise role of item-item similarity on the
   cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying perceptual false memories in
   older adults. In addition, work in our laboratory has suggested that
   when investigating the neural basis of false memories in older adults,
   it is equally as critical to take into account interindividual
   variability in behavior. With both factors in mind, the present study
   was the first to examine how both controlled, systematic differences in
   perceptual relatedness between targets and lures and individual
   differences in true and false recognition contribute to the neural basis
   of both true and false memories in older adults. Results suggest that
   between-subject variability in memory performance modulates neural
   activity in key regions associated with false memories in aging, whereas
   systematic differences in perceptual similarity did not modulate neural
   activity associated with false memories. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Real-time fMRI neurofeedback is a feasible tool to learn the volitional
   regulation of brain activity. So far, most studies provide continuous
   feedback information that is presented upon every volume acquisition.
   Although this maximizes the temporal resolution of feedback information,
   it may be accompanied by some disadvantages. Participants can be
   distracted from the regulation task due to (1) the intrinsic delay of
   the hemodynamic response and associated feedback and (2) limited
   cognitive resources available to simultaneously evaluate feedback
   information and stay engaged with the task. Here, we systematically
   investigate differences between groups presented with different variants
   of feedback (continuous vs. intermittent) and a control group receiving
   no feedback on their ability to regulate amygdala activity using
   positive memories and feelings. In contrast to the feedback groups, no
   learning effect was observed in the group without any feedback
   presentation. The group receiving intermittent feedback exhibited better
   amygdala regulation performance when compared with the group receiving
   continuous feedback. Behavioural measurements show that these effects
   were reflected in differences in task engagement. Overall, we not only
   demonstrate that the presentation of feedback is a prerequisite to learn
   volitional control of amygdala activity but also that intermittent
   feedback is superior to continuous feedback presentation.}},

   (fMRI), this study (N = 24 undergraduate students) compared neural bases
   of mathematical problem solving (i.e., number series completion,
   mathematical word problem solving, and geometric problem solving) and
   arithmetical computation. Direct subject- and item-wise comparisons
   revealed that mathematical problem solving typically had greater
   activation than arithmetical computation in all 7 regions of the
   semantic system (which was based on a meta-analysis of 120 functional
   neuroimaging studies on semantic processing). Arithmetical computation
   typically had greater activation in the supplementary motor area and
   left precentral gyrus. The results suggest that the semantic system in
   the brain supports mathematical problem solving.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: In their relentless pursuit of thinness, individuals with
   anorexia nervosa (AN) engage in maladaptive behaviors (restrictive food
   choices and overexercising) that may originate in altered decision
   making and learning.
   METHODS: In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we
   employed computational modeling to elucidate the neural correlates of
   feedback learning and value-based decision making in 36 female patients
   with AN and 36 age-matched healthy volunteers (12-24 years).
   Participants performed a decision task that required adaptation to
   changing reward contingencies. Data were analyzed within a hierarchical
   Gaussian filter model that captures interindividual variability in
   learning under uncertainty.
   RESULTS: Behaviorally, patients displayed an increased learning rate
   specifically after punishments. At the neural level, hemodynamic
   correlates for the learning rate, expected value, and prediction error
   did not differ between the groups. However, activity in the posterior
   medial frontal cortex was elevated in AN following punishment.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the neural underpinning of
   feedback learning is selectively altered for punishment in AN.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated alterations of resting-state networks (RSNs) in
   primary insomnia patients as well as relationships between these changes
   and clinical features.
   Fifty-nine primary insomnia patients and 53 healthy control subjects
   underwent a resting-state fMRI scan (rs-fMRI). Ten RSNs were identified
   using independent component analysis of rs-fMRI data. To assess
   significant differences between the two groups, voxel-wise analysis of
   ten RSNs was conducted using dual regression with FSL randomised
   non-parametric permutation testing and a threshold-free cluster enhanced
   technique to control for multiple comparisons. Relationships between
   abnormal functional connectivity and clinical variables were then
   investigated with Pearson's correlation analysis.
   Primary insomnia patients showed decreased connectivity in regions of
   the right frontoparietal network (FPN), including the superior parietal
   lobule and superior frontal gyrus. Moreover, decreased connectivity in
   the right middle temporal gyrus and right lateral occipital cortex with
   the FPN showed significant positive correlations with disease duration
   and self-rated anxiety, respectively.
   Our study suggests that primary insomnia patients are characterised by
   abnormal organisation of the right FPN, and dysfunction of the FPN is
   correlated with disease duration and anxiety. The results enhance our
   understanding of neural substrates underlying symptoms of primary
   insomnia from the viewpoint of resting-state networks.
   aEuro cent Primary insomnia patients showed altered functional
   connectivity in the right FPN.

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{30-39}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Previous research has shown that exposure to prosocial video games
   increases empathy and related-prosocial behaviors. However, little is
   known about the neural correlates of this effect. This work examined the
   electrophysiological features of the prosocial video game effect on
   prosociality by using a help-needed decision task. Seventy participants
   played either prosocial or neutral video games for 20 min and then
   participated in an event-related potential (ERP) experiment that
   estimated the perceived need for help in others and prosocial behavior
   (i.e., charitable money donated). The results showed no significant
   differences between the two games in perceived need for help and money
   donation (prosocial behavior). Moreover, there were inconsistent results
   for N2 and P300 waves, in which weak evidence was found for larger
   frontal N2 when help was needed but not offered in the prosocial video
   game group; however, there were no differences in right-parietal P300
   amplitudes. These findings provide no supportive evidence for the
   general learning model, which proposes that prosocial video games may
   promote empathy and prosocial-related behaviors. However, we should note
   the limitation of the small sample size. Further implications and
   limitations are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Successful social relationships require a consideration of a partner's
   thoughts and intentions. This aspect of social life is captured in the
   social mindfulness paradigm (SoMi task), in which participants make
   decisions that either limit or preserve options for their interaction
   partner's subsequent choice. Here we investigated the neural correlates
   of spontaneous socially mindful and unmindful behaviours. Functional
   magnetic resonance data were acquired from 47 healthy adolescents and
   young adults (age 16-27) as they completed the SoMi task. Being faced
   with socially relevant choices was associated with activity in the
   medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, caudate, and insula, which
   is consistent with prior neuroeconomical research. Importantly, socially
   mindful choices were associated with activity in the right parietal
   cortex and the caudate, whereas unmindful choices were associated with
   activity in the left prefrontal cortex. These neural findings were
   consistent with the behavioural preference for mindful choices,
   suggesting that socially mindful decisions are the basic inclination,
   whereas socially unmindful responses may require greater effort and
   control. Together, these results begin to uncover the neural correlates
   of socially mindful and unmindful choices, and illuminate the
   psychological processes involved in cooperative social behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{According to the Empathizing-Systemizing theory (E-S Theory), individual
   differences in how people understand the physical world (systemizing)
   and the social world (empathizing), are two continuums in the general
   population with several implications, from vocational interests to
   skills in the social and physical domains. The underlying mechanisms of
   intuitive physics performance among individuals with strong systemizing
   and weak empathizing (systemizers) are, however, unknown. Our results
   affirm higher intuitive physics skills in healthy adult systemizers
   (N=36), and further reveal the brain mechanisms that are characteristic
   for those individuals in carrying out such tasks. When the participants
   performed intuitive physics tasks during functional magnetic resonance
   imaging, combined higher systemizing and lower empathizing was
   associated with stronger activations in parts of the default mode
   network (DMN, cuneus and posterior cingulate gyrus), middle occipital
   gyrus, and parahippocampal region. The posterior cingulate gyrus and
   parahippocampal gyrus were specifically associated with systemizing
   ``brain type{''} even after controlling for task performance, while
   especially in the parietal cortex, the activation changes were simply
   explained by higher task performance. We therefore suggest that
   utilization of DMN-parahippocampal complex, suggested to play a role in
   internalizing and activating long-term spatial memory representations,
   is the factor that distinguishes systemizers from empathizers with the
   opposite ``brain type{''} in intuitive physics tasks.}},

Title = {{The neural correlates of self-referential memory encoding and retrieval
   in schizophrenia}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{19-27}},
Month = {{JAN 31}},
Abstract = {{Background: Enhanced memory for self-oriented information is known as
   the self-referential memory (SRM) effect. fMRI studies of the SRM effect
   have focused almost exclusively on encoding, revealing selective
   engagement of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during ``self{''}
   relative to other processing conditions. Other critical areas for
   self-processing include ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC),
   temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and posterior cingulate/precuneus
   (PCC/PC). Previous behavioral studies show that individuals with
   schizophrenia fail to benefit from this memory boost. However, the
   neural correlates of this deficit, at either encoding or retrieval, are
   unknown.
   Methods: Twenty individuals with schizophrenia and 16 healthy controls
   completed an event-related fMRI SRM paradigm. During encoding, trait
   adjectives were judged in terms of structural features ({''}case{''}
   condition), social desirability ({''}other{''} condition), or as
   self-referential ({''}self{''} condition). Participants then completed
   an unexpected recognition test (retrieval phase). We examined BOLD
   activation during both encoding and retrieval within mPFC, vlPFC, TPJ,
   and PCC/PC regions-of-interest (ROIs).
   Results: During encoding, fMRI data indicated both groups had greater
   activation during the ``self{''} relative to the ``other{''} condition
   across ROIs. Controls showed this primarily in mPFC whereas patients
   showed this in PCC/PC. During retrieval, fMRI data indicated controls
   showed differentiation across ROIs between ``self{''} and ``other{''}
   conditions, but patients did not.
   Conclusions: Results suggest regional differences in the neural
   processing of self-referential information in individuals with
   schizophrenia, perhaps because representation of the self is not as well
   established in patients relative to controls. The current study presents
   novel findings that add to the literature implicating impaired

Abstract = {{We have previously reported that threat-related amygdala activity
   measured during a baseline fMRI scan predicts the experience of
   depression and anxiety associated with stressful life events years
   later. Here, we examine whether two broad measures of childhood
   environmental enrichment, namely parental educational achievement and
   subjective parental socioeconomic status, buffer against the effects of
   amygdala activity on future vulnerability to stress. Analyses of data
   available from 579 young adults revealed that maternal, but not
   paternal, educational achievement moderates the association between
   amygdala activity, recent life stress, and changes in mood and anxiety
   symptoms, even when controlling for participants' current subjective
   socioeconomic status. Specifically, only participants reporting lower
   maternal educational achievement exhibited our previously observed
   interaction between amygdala activity and future life stress predicting
   increases in depression and anxiety. These results suggest that higher
   maternal educational achievement may help buffer stress sensitivity
   associated with heightened threat-related amygdala activity.}},

Title = {{Social affective context reveals altered network dynamics in
   schizophrenia patients}},
Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JAN 31}},
Abstract = {{Impairments in social cognition and interactions are core
   psychopathologies in schizophrenia, often manifesting as an inability to
   appropriately relate to the intentions and feelings of others.
   Neuroimaging has helped to demarcate the dynamics of two distinct
   functional connectivity circuits underlying the social-affective
   processes related to mentalization (known as Theory of Mind, ToM) and
   somatic-affiliation (known as Embodied Simulation, ES). While evidence
   points to abnormal activation patterns within these networks among those
   suffering from schizophrenia, it is yet unclear however, if these
   patients exhibit this abnormal functional connectivity in the context of
   social-affective experiences. The current fMRI study, investigated
   functional connectivity dynamics within ToM and ES networks as subjects
   experienced evolving cinematic portrayals of fear. During scanning,
   schizophrenia patients and healthy controls passively watched a
   cinematic scene in which a mother and her son face various threatening
   events. Participants then provided a continuous and retrospective report
   of their fear intensity during a second viewing outside the scanner.
   Using network cohesion index (NCI) analysis, we examined modulations of
   ES-related and ToM-related functional connectivity dynamics and their
   relation to symptom severity and the continuous emotional ratings of the
   induced cinematic fear. Compared to patients, healthy controls showed
   higher ES-NCI and marginally lower ToM-NCI during emotional peaks.
   Cross-correlation analysis revealed an intriguing dynamic between NCI
   and the inter-group difference of reported fear. Schizophrenia patients
   rated their fear as lower relative to healthy controls, shortly after
   exhibiting lower ES connectivity. This increased difference in rating
   was also followed by higher ToM connectivity among schizophrenia
   patients. The clinical relevance of these findings is further
   highlighted by the following two results: (a) ToM-NCI was found to have
   a strong correlation with the severity of general symptoms during one of
   the two main emotional peaks (Spearman R = 0.77); and (b) k-mean
   clustering demonstrated that the networks' NCI dynamic during the
   social-affective context reliably differentiated between patients and
   controls. Together, these findings point to a possible neural marker for
   abnormal social-affective processing in schizophrenia, manifested as the
   disturbed balance between two functional networks involved in
   social-affective affiliation. This in turn suggests that exaggerated
   mentalization over somatic-affiliative processing, in response to
   another's' distress may underlie social-affective deficits in
   schizophrenia.}},

Title = {{Altered reward system reactivity for personalized circumscribed
   interests in autism}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR AUTISM}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JAN 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Neurobiological research in autism spectrum disorders (ASD)
   has paid little attention on brain mechanisms that cause and maintain
   restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests (RRBIs). Evidence
   indicates an imbalance in the brain's reward system responsiveness to
   social and non-social stimuli may contribute to both social deficits and
   RRBIs. Thus, this study's central aim was to compare brain
   responsiveness to individual RRBI (i.e., circumscribed interests), with
   social rewards (i.e., social approval), in youth with ASD relative to
   typically developing controls (TDCs).
   Methods: We conducted a 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   study to investigate the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent effect of
   personalized circumscribed interest rewards versus social rewards in 39
   youth with ASD relative to 22 TDC. To probe the reward system, we
   employed short video clips as reinforcement in an instrumental incentive
   delay task. This optimization increased the task's ecological validity
   compared to still pictures that are often used in this line of research.
   Results: Compared to TDCs, youth with ASD had stronger reward system
   responses for CIs mostly within the non-social realm (e.g., video games)
   than social rewards (e.g., approval). Additionally, this imbalance
   within the caudate nucleus' responsiveness was related to greater social
   impairment.
   Conclusions: The current data support the idea of reward system
   dysfunction that may contribute to enhanced motivation for RRBIs in ASD,
   accompanied by diminished motivation for social engagement. If a
   dysregulated reward system indeed supports the emergence and maintenance
   of social and non-social symptoms of ASD, then strategically targeting
   the reward system in future treatment endeavors may allow for more
   efficacious treatment practices that help improve outcomes for
   individuals with ASD and their families.}},

Abstract = {{Impairment in simulation, i.e., the generation of internal
   representations of experiences, may contribute to social dysfunction in
   schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SZ). Using a novel fMRI task, we
   identified neural representations generated during simulation of
   sensorimotor experiences and evaluated their associations with
   socioemotional function in 19 individuals with SZ and 24
   psychiatrically-healthy controls (HC). Participants watched videos
   depicting a painful sensorimotor experience in the hand or foot of
   another person and were then asked to imagine how unpleasant it would be
   to undergo that experience themselves, eliciting simulation. A localizer
   task identified regions-of-interest (ROIs) within each participant's
   sensorimotor cortices (SC) recruited by firsthand sensory experiences in
   hands and feet. Simulation engaged these ROIs in HC and SZ.
   Simulationrelated activation in ROIs did not differ between groups but
   was associated with participants' social function. Findings indicate
   that simulation elicits specific neural representations within the SC
   and the strength of these representations might be linked to social
   function.}},

   affective mentalizing in individuals with psychotic disorders and
   varying symptom levels (positive, negative, cognitive). Participants
   were drawn from an adjudicated inpatient forensic psychiatric population

   32-channel ultra-fast multiband imaging sequence. Mentalizing task
   performance and functional connectivity were assessed in psychotic
   criminal offenders (n = 46) and nonpsychotic offenders (n = 41).
   Temporal coherent brain networks were estimated with group independent
   component analysis (ICA). Relative to nonpsychotic offenders, psychotic
   offenders showed impaired task performance and reduced activation in a
   component comprising the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, superior

Title = {{Neural correlates underlying change in state self-esteem}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JAN 29}},
Abstract = {{State self-esteem, the momentary feeling of self-worth, functions as a
   sociometer involved in maintenance of interpersonal relations. How
   others' appraisal is subjectively interpreted to change state
   self-esteem is unknown, and the neural underpinnings of this process
   remain to be elucidated. We hypothesized that changes in state
   self-esteem are represented by the mentalizing network, which is
   modulated by interactions with regions involved in the subjective
   interpretation of others' appraisal. To test this hypothesis, we
   conducted task-based and resting-state fMRI. Participants were
   repeatedly presented with their reputations, and then rated their
   pleasantness and reported their state self-esteem. To evaluate the
   individual sensitivity of the change in state self-esteem based on
   pleasantness (i.e., the subjective interpretation of reputation), we
   calculated evaluation sensitivity as the rate of change in state
   self-esteem per unit pleasantness. Evaluation sensitivity varied across
   participants, and was positively correlated with precuneus activity
   evoked by reputation rating. Resting-state fMRI revealed that evaluation
   sensitivity was positively correlated with functional connectivity of
   the precuneus with areas activated by negative reputation, but
   negatively correlated with areas activated by positive reputation. Thus,
   the precuneus, as the part of the mentalizing system, serves as a
   gateway for translating the subjective interpretation of reputation into
   state self-esteem.}},

   Leader Name among Christians: An ERP Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JAN 25}},
Abstract = {{Existing neuroimaging studies have shown that religion, as a subjective
   culture, can influence self-referential processing. However, the time
   course of this impact remains unclear. The present study examined how
   Christians process their own names, the name of their religious leader
   (i.e., Jesus), and a famous person's name (i.e., Yao Ming). Behavioral
   and EEG data were recorded while the participants performed a name-color
   judgment task for these three names. The behavioral data showed no
   significant differences in reaction time or accuracy among the names.
   However, the ERP data showed that the P200 and P300 amplitudes elicited
   by the self-name and religious leader name were larger than those
   elicited by the famous name. Furthermore, the self-name also elicited a
   larger P300 amplitude than the religious leader name did. These results
   suggested that both the self-name and the religious leader name were
   processed preferentially due to their important social value for the
   self as compared to a generally famous name. Importantly, the
   dissociation between the self-name and the religious leader name was
   observed at a high-order cognitive stage, which might be attributed to
   their different roles in one's self-concept.}},

Title = {{The real-life costs of emotion regulation in anorexia nervosa: a
   combined ecological momentary assessment and fMRI study}},
Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JAN 24}},
Abstract = {{Regulation of emotions is necessary for successful attainment of
   short-term and long-term goals. However, overregulation may also have
   its costs. In anorexia nervosa (AN), forgoing food intake despite
   emaciation and endocrine signals that promote eating is an example of
   ``too much{''} self-control. Here we investigated whether voluntary
   emotion regulation in AN patients comes with associated
   disorder-relevant costs. Thirty-five patients with acute AN and
   thirty-five age-matched healthy controls (HCs) performed an established
   emotion regulation paradigm during functional magnetic resonance imaging
   after an overnight fast. The task required reducing emotions induced by
   positively valenced pictures via distancing. We calculated a neural
   regulation score from responses recorded in a reward-related brain
   region of interest (ventral striatum; VS) by subtracting activation
   measured on ``positive distance{''} trials from that elicited under the
   ``positive watch{''} (baseline) condition. Complementing the imaging
   data, we used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to probe
   disorder-related rumination and affect six times/day for 2 weeks
   following the scanning session. The neural regulation score indicating
   reduced VS activation during emotion regulation was used as a predictor
   in hierarchical linear models with EMA measures as outcomes. No group
   differences in neural activity were found for the main contrasts of the
   task. However, regulation of VS activity was associated with increased
   body-related rumination and increased negative affect in AN, but not in
   HC. In line with this finding, correlational analysis with longitudinal
   BMI measurements revealed a link between greater VS regulation and
   poorer treatment outcome after 60 and 90 days. Together, these results
   identify a neural correlate of altered emotion regulation in AN, which
   seems to be detrimental to psychological well-being and may interfere
   with recovery.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{974-988}},
Month = {{JAN 24}},
Abstract = {{As adolescents transition to the complex world of adults, optimizing
   predictions about others' preferences becomes vital for successful
   social interactions. Mounting evidence suggests that these social
   learning processes are affected by ongoing brain development across
   adolescence. A mechanistic understanding of how adolescents optimize
   social predictions and how these learning strategies are implemented in
   the brain is lacking. To fill this gap, we combined computational
   modeling with functional neuroimaging. In a novel social learning task,
   male and female human adolescents and adults predicted the preferences
   of peers and could update their predictions based on trial-by-trial
   feedback about the peers' actual preferences. Participants also rated
   their own preferences for the task items and similar additional items.
   To describe how participants optimize their inferences over time, we
   pitted simple reinforcement learning models against more specific
   ``combination{''} models, which describe inferences based on a
   combination of reinforcement learning from past feedback and
   participants' own preferences. Formal model comparison revealed that, of
   the tested models, combination models best described how adults and
   adolescents update predictions of others. Parameter estimates of the
   best-fitting model differed between age groups, with adolescents showing
   more conservative updating. This developmental difference was
   accompanied by a shift in encoding predictions and the errors thereof
   within the medial prefrontal and fusiform cortices. In the adolescent
   group, encoding of own preferences and prediction errors scaled with
   parent-reported social traits, which provides additional external
   validity for our learning task and the winning computational model. Our
   findings thus help to specify adolescent-specific social learning
   processes.}},

Title = {{Decoding Pedophilia: Increased Anterior Insula Response to Infant Animal
   Pictures}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JAN 23}},
Abstract = {{Previous research found increased brain responses of men with sexual
   interest in children (i.e., pedophiles) not only to pictures of naked
   children but also to pictures of child faces. This opens the possibly
   that pedophilia is linked (in addition to or instead of an aberrant
   sexual system) to an over-active nurturing system. To test this
   hypothesis we exposed pedophiles and healthy controls to pictures of
   infant and adult animals during functional magnetic resonance imaging of
   the brain. By using pictures of infant animals (instead of human
   infants), we aimed to elicit nurturing processing without triggering
   sexual processing. We hypothesized that elevated brain responses to
   nurturing stimuli will be found-in addition to other brain areas - in
   the anterior insula of pedophiles because this area was repeatedly found
   to be activated when adults see pictures of babies. Behavioral ratings
   confirmed that pictures of infant or adult animals were not perceived as
   sexually arousing neither by the pedophilic participants nor by the
   heathy controls. Statistical analysis was applied to the whole brain as
   well as to the anterior insula as region of interest. Only in pedophiles
   did infants relative to adult animals increase brain activity in the
   anterior insula, supplementary motor cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal
   areas. Within-group analysis revealed an increased brain response to
   infant animals in the left anterior insular cortex of the pedophilic
   participants. Currently, pedophilia is considered the consequence of
   disturbed sexual or executive brain processing, but details are far from
   known. The present findings raise the question whether there is also an
   over-responsive nurturing system in pedophilia.}},

Title = {{The rewarding nature of provocation-focused rumination in women with
   borderline personality disorder: a preliminary fMRI investigation}},
Journal = {{BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER AND EMOTION DYSREGULATION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JAN 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Understanding why individuals with borderline personality
   disorder (BPD) ruminate on prior provocations, despite its negative
   outcomes, is crucial to improving interventions. Provocation-focused
   rumination may be rewarding in the short term by amplifying anger and
   producing feelings of justification, validation, and increased energy,
   while reducing self-directed negative affect. If provocation-focused
   rumination is utilized regularly as a rewarding emotion regulation
   strategy, it could result in increased activation in reward-related
   neural regions. The present pilot study examined neural correlates of
   provocation-focused rumination, relative to other forms of thought, in
   BPD.
   Method: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was utilized to
   examine this theory in a pilot study of women diagnosed with BPD (n =
   13) and healthy controls (n = 16). All participants received highly
   critical feedback on a previously written essay in the scanner, followed
   by prompts to engage in provocation-focused, self-focused, and neutral
   thought.
   Results: Whole-brain analyses showed that in response to the
   provocation, participants with BPD (compared to controls) demonstrated
   increased activation in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). BPD
   participants also showed greater activation in the dorsomedial PFC
   during provocation-focused rumination (relative to neutral-focus).
   Subsequent ROI analyses revealed that provocation-focused rumination
   (compared to neutral-focus) increased activation in the nucleus
   accumbens for the BPD group only.
   Conclusions: These findings, while preliminary due to the small sample
   size and limitations of the protocol, provide initial data consistent
   with the proposed neurobiological mechanism promoting
   provocation-focused rumination in BPD. Directions for further research
   are discussed.}},

Title = {{Connectivity of the hippocampus and Broca's area during acquisition of a
   novel grammar}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{165}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Following Opitz and Friederici (2003) suggesting interactions of the
   hippocampal system and the prefrontal cortex as the neural mechanism
   underlying novel grammar learning, the present fMRI study investigated
   functional connectivity of bilateral BA 44/45 and the hippocampus during
   an artificial grammar learning (AGL) task. Our results, contrary to the
   previously reported interactions, demonstrated parallel (but separate)
   contributions of both regions, each with their own interactions, to the
   process of novel grammar acquisition. The functional connectivity
   pattern of Broca's area pointed to the importance of coherent activity
   of left frontal areas around the core language processing region for
   successful grammar learning. Furthermore, connectivity patterns of left
   and right hippocampi (predominantly with occipital areas) were found to
   be a strong predictor of high performance on the task. Finally,
   increasing functional connectivity over time of both left and right BA
   44/45 with the right posterior cingulate cortex and the right
   temporo-parietal areas points to the importance of multimodal and
   attentional processes supporting novel grammar acquisition. Moreover, it
   highlights the right-hemispheric involvement in initial stages of L2
   learning. These latter interactions were found to operate irrespective
   of the task performance, making them an obligatory mechanism
   accompanying novel grammar learning.}},

Title = {{The role of the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) in action observation:
   Agent detection rather than visuospatial transformation}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{165}},
Pages = {{48-55}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Recognizing and understanding the actions of others is usually coupled
   with perceiving someone else's body movements from a third person
   perspective (3pp) whereas we perceive our own actions from a first
   person perspective (1pp). From a neural viewpoint, a recent finding is
   that perceiving actions from a 3pp as compared to a 1pp activates the
   temporoparietal junction, a brain region associated with visuospatial
   transformation and perspective taking but also with mental state
   inference and Theory of Mind (ToM). The present fMRI study characterizes
   the response profile of TPJ to elucidate its role in action observation.
   Participants observed naturalistic and pixelized object-directed actions
   from a 3pp and 1pp. Critically, in the pixelized condition the action
   goal could only be inferred from the movement kinematics. Both left and
   right TPJ revealed an interaction: Neural activity in TPJ was enhanced
   for 3pp vs. 1pp actions in the naturalistic but not pixelized condition.
   This finding contradicts theories proposing that TPJ is generally
   involved in transforming the action into the observer's perspective to
   match perceived body movements with visuomotor representations in the
   observer's motor system, which would be particularly required when
   actions can only be inferred from movement kinematics. Instead, our
   results support the theory that perceptual 3pp-selective cues trigger
   ToM-related processes such as detection of other agents and reasoning
   about an action's underlying mental states.}},

Abstract = {{We used fMRI to investigate neural correlates of responses to erotic
   pictures and videos in heterosexual (N = 26), bisexual (N = 26), and
   homosexual (N = 24) women, ages 25-50. We focused on the ventral
   striatum, an area of the brain associated with desire, extending
   previous findings from the sexual psychophysiology literature in which
   homosexual women had greater category specificity (relative to
   heterosexual and bisexual women) in their responses to male and female
   erotic stimuli. We found that homosexual women's subjective and neural
   responses reflected greater bias towards female stimuli, compared with
   bisexual and heterosexual women, whose responses did not significantly
   differ. These patterns were also suggested by whole brain analyses, with
   homosexual women showing category-specific activations of greater
   extents in visual and auditory processing areas. Bisexual women tended
   to show more mixed patterns, with activations more responsive to female
   stimuli in sensory processing areas, and activations more responsive to
   male stimuli in areas associated with social cognition.}},

   Games on Aggression: A Resting-State fMRI Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JAN 12}},
Abstract = {{A great many of empirical researches have proved that longtime exposure
   to violent video game can lead to a series of negative effects. Although
   research has focused on the neural basis of the correlation between
   violent video game and aggression, little is known whether the
   spontaneous brain activity is associated with violent video game
   exposure. To address this question, we measured the spontaneous brain
   activity using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI). We used the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and
   fractional ALFF (fALFF) to quantify spontaneous brain activity. The
   results showed there is no significant difference in ALFF, or fALFF,
   between violent video game group and the control part, indicating that
   long time exposure to violent video games won't significantly influence
   spontaneous brain activity, especially the core brain regions such as
   execution control, moral judgment and short-term memory. This implies
   the adverse impact of violent video games is exaggerated.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 11}},
Abstract = {{Many forms of joint action involve physical coupling between the
   participants, such as when moving a sofa together or dancing a tango. We
   report the results of a novel two-person functional MRI study in which
   trained couple dancers engaged in bimanual contact with an experimenter
   standing next to the bore of the magnet, and in which the two alternated
   between being the leader and the follower of joint improvised movements.
   Leading showed a general pattern of self-orientation, being associated
   with brain areas involved in motor planning, navigation, sequencing,
   action monitoring, and error correction. In contrast, following showed a
   far more sensory, externally-oriented pattern, revealing areas involved
   in somatosensation, proprioception, motion tracking, social cognition,
   and outcome monitoring. We also had participants perform a ``mutual{''}
   condition in which the movement patterns were pre-learned and the roles
   were symmetric, thereby minimizing any tendency toward either leading or
   following. The mutual condition showed greater activity in brain areas
   involved in mentalizing and social reward than did leading or following.
   Finally, the analysis of improvisation revealed the dual importance of
   motor-planning and working-memory areas. We discuss these results in
   terms of theories of both joint action and improvisation.}},

Month = {{JAN 11}},
Abstract = {{Whether empathic racial bias could be modulated is a subject of intense
   interest. The present study was carried out to explore whether empathic
   racial bias for pain is modulated by minimal group. Chinese/Western
   faces with neutral expressions receiving painful (needle penetration) or
   non-painful (Q-tip touch) stimulation were presented. Participants were
   asked to rate the pain intensity felt by Chinese/Western models of
   ingroup/outgroup members. Their implicit racial bias were also measured.
   Two lines of evidence indicated that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
   was modulated by racial bias: (1) Chinese models elicited stronger
   activity than Western did in the ACC, and (2) activity in the ACC was
   modulated by implicit racial bias. Whereas the right anterior insula
   (rAI) were modulated by ingroup bias, in which ingroup member elicited
   stronger activity than outgroup member did. Furthermore, activity in the
   ACC was modulated by activity of rAI (i.e., ingroup bias) in the pain
   condition, while activity in the rAI was modulated by activity of ACC
   (i.e., racial bias) in the nopain condition. Our results provide
   evidence that there are different neural correlates for racial bias and
   ingroup bias, and neural racial bias for pain can be modulated by
   minimal group.}},

   an fMRI Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JAN 9}},
Abstract = {{Anticipation for future confers great benefits to human well-being and
   mental health. However, previous work focus on how people's well-being
   correlate with brain activities during perception of emotional stimuli,
   rather than anticipation for the future events. Here, the current study
   investigated how well-being relates to neural circuitry underlying the
   anticipating process of future desired events. Using event-related
   functional magnetic resonance imaging, 40 participants were scanned
   while they were performing an emotion anticipation task, in which they
   were instructed to anticipate the positive or neutral events. The
   results showed that bilateral medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) were
   activated during anticipation for positive events relative to neutral
   events, and the enhanced brain activation in MPFC was associated with
   higher level of well-being. The findings suggest a neural mechanism by
   which the anticipation process to future desired events correlates to
   human well-being, which provide a future-oriented view on the neural
   sources of well-being.}},

Title = {{Altered Neural Activity during Irony Comprehension in Unaffected
   First-Degree Relatives of Schizophrenia Patients-An fMRI Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JAN 9}},
Abstract = {{Irony is a type of figurative language in which the literal meaning of
   the expression is the opposite of what the speaker intends to
   communicate. Even though schizophrenic patients are known as typically
   impaired in irony comprehension and in the underlying neural functions,
   to date no one has explored the neural correlates of figurative language
   comprehension in first-degree relatives of schizophrenic patients. In
   the present study, we examined the neural correlates of irony
   understanding in schizophrenic patients and in unaffected first-degree
   relatives of patients compared to healthy adults with functional MRI.
   Our aim was to investigate if possible alterations of the neural
   circuits supporting irony comprehension in first-degree relatives of
   patients with schizophrenia would fulfill the familiality criterion of
   an endophenotype. We examined 12 schizophrenic patients, 12 first-degree
   relatives of schizophrenia patients and 12 healthy controls with
   functional MRI while they were performing irony and control tasks.
   Different phases of irony processing were examined, such as context
   processing and ironic statement comprehension. Patients had
   significantly more difficulty understanding irony than controls or
   relatives. Patients also showed markedly different neural activation
   pattern compared to controls in both stages of irony processing.
   Although no significant differences were found in the performance of the
   irony tasks between the control group and the relative group, during the
   fMRI analysis, the relatives showed stronger brain activity in the left
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during the context processing phase of
   irony tasks than the control group. However, the controls demonstrated
   higher activations in the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and in the
   right inferior frontal gyrus during the ironic statement phase of the
   irony tasks than the relative group. Our results show that despite good
   task performance, first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients had
   alterations in the neural circuits during irony processing. Thus, we
   suggest that neural alteration of irony comprehension could be a
   potential endophenotypic marker of schizophrenia.}},

   Brain Regions in Adult Cortex: an fNIRS Study}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JAN 9}},
Abstract = {{Emotional expressions of others embedded in speech prosodies are
   important for social interactions. This study used functional
   near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate how speech prosodies of
   different emotional categories are processed in the cortex. The results
   demonstrated several cerebral areas critical for emotional prosody
   processing. We confirmed that the superior temporal cortex, especially
   the right middle and posterior parts of superior temporal gyrus (BA
   22/42), primarily works to discriminate between emotional and neutral
   prosodies. Furthermore, the results suggested that categorization of
   emotions occurs within a high-level brain region-the frontal cortex,
   since the brain activation patterns were distinct when positive (happy)
   were contrasted to negative (fearful and angry) prosody in the left
   middle part of inferior frontal gyrus (BA 45) and the frontal eye field
   (BA8), and when angry were contrasted to neutral prosody in bilateral
   orbital frontal regions (BA 10/11). These findings verified and extended
   previous fMRI findings in adult brain and also provided a ``developed
   version{''} of brain activation for our following neonatal study.}},

   Social Encounters}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JAN 4}},
Abstract = {{Despite evidence for the role of group membership in the neural
   correlates of social cognition, the mechanisms associated with
   processing non-verbal behaviors displayed by racially ingroup vs.
   outgroup members remain unclear. Here, 20 Caucasian participants
   underwent fMRI recording while observing social encounters with ingroup
   and outgroup characters displaying dynamic and static non-verbal
   behaviors. Dynamic behaviors included approach and avoidance behaviors,
   preceded or not by a handshake; both dynamic and static behaviors were
   followed by participants' ratings. Behaviorally, participants showed
   bias toward their ingroup members, demonstrated by faster/slower
   reaction times for evaluating ingroup static/approach behaviors,
   respectively. At the neural level, despite overall similar responses in
   the action observation network to ingroup and outgroup encounters, the
   medial prefrontal cortex showed dissociable activation, possibly
   reflecting spontaneous processing of ingroup static behaviors and
   positive evaluations of ingroup approach behaviors. The anterior
   cingulate and superior frontal cortices also showed sensitivity to race,
   reflected in coordinated and reduced activation for observing ingroup
   static behaviors. Finally, the posterior superior temporal sulcus showed
   uniquely increased activity to observing ingroup handshakes. These
   findings shed light on the mechanisms of racial ingroup bias in
   observing social encounters, and have implications for understanding
   factors related to successful interactions with individuals from diverse
   backgrounds.}},

   Pain}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JAN 4}},
Abstract = {{The questions whether and how empathy for pain can be modulated by acute
   alcohol intoxication in the non-dependent population remain unanswered.
   To address these questions, a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
   within-subject study design was adopted in this study, in which healthy
   social drinkers were asked to complete a pain-judgment task using
   pictures depicting others' body parts in painful or non-painful
   situations during fMRI scanning, either under the influence of alcohol
   intoxication or placebo conditions. Empathic neural activity for pain
   was reduced by alcohol intoxication only in the dorsal anterior
   cingulate cortex (dACC). More interestingly, we observed that empathic
   neural activity for pain in the right anterior insula (rAI) was
   significantly correlated with trait empathy only after alcohol
   intoxication, along with impaired functional connectivity between the
   rAI and the fronto-parietal attention network. Our results reveal that
   alcohol intoxication not only inhibits empathic neural responses for
   pain but also leads to trait empathy inflation, possibly via impaired
   top-down attentional control. These findings help to explain the neural
   mechanism underlying alcohol-related social problems.}},

Abstract = {{Peer victimization is associated with increased risk for mental health
   problems. These adverse psychological outcomes are linked with altered
   cognitive and emotional processes and their related neural functioning.
   In the present study, by using functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI), we examined whether peer victimization was associated with
   heightened neural response to social exclusion. Participants (N = 45;
   M-age = 17.7 years, SD = 0.60; 36 women) included three mutually
   exclusive groups: peer-victimized individuals (targets of bullying),
   cyberdefenders (defended peers who were being cyberbullied), and
   controls (not involved as targets or cyberdefenders). All participants
   underwent an fMRI scan while playing Cyberball, an experimental paradigm
   that simulates social exclusion. Peer victimization was associated with
   increased neural response in the left amygdala, left parahippocampal
   gyrus, left inferior frontal operculum, and right fusiform gyrus.
   Understanding the acute neural response to social exclusion in
   peer-victimized individuals may provide insight into their increased

Abstract = {{Scientific progress in recent neurofeedback research may bring about a
   new type of moral neuroenhancement, namely, neurofeedback-based moral
   enhancement; however, this has yet to be examined thoroughly. This paper
   presents an ethical analysis of the possibility of neurofeedback-based
   moral enhancement and demonstrates that this type of moral enhancement
   sheds new light on the moral enhancement debate. First, I survey this
   debate and extract the typical structural flow of its arguments. Second,
   by applying structure to the case of neurofeedback-based moral
   enhancement, I examine the ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI) to
   show that this technique is unique and traditionalist, which makes it
   compatible with almost all our conservative notions, so that it,
   accordingly, can be seen as an ethically acceptable option. Third, by
   rejecting the premise in the moral enhancement debate that
   bio/neuro-enhancement has its unique ELSI that traditional methods would
   never create, I demonstrate that, by virtue of its traditional or
   conservative features, neurofeedback-based moral enhancement can be
   incorporated into the traditional moral education network. Finally, I
   conclude that, being apart of the traditional moral education network,
   neurofeedback-based moral enhancement can be a unique and ethically
   acceptable option of moral neuroenhancement.}},

Abstract = {{The tendency of people to punish unfair behavior, even when this
   behavior does not directly affect them, or the punishment implies a
   personal cost, has been reported in the literature. Different types of
   punishment have been identified: altruistic punishment, the punishment
   of unfair behaviour; parochial altruism, the tendency to use punishment
   to protect and favor members of one's group at the expense of members of
   other groups, even when it involves no personal gain; and anti-social
   punishment, punishment of loyal or cooperative behaviors which entails a
   personal cost. Recently, research in neuroscience has focused on how
   neuronal processes involved in cooperation and punishment behaviors may
   be modulated across different personal and group membership contexts.
   Recent studies have investigated not only behavioral differences, but
   also the neural correlates of punishing unfair behaviors, which may
   violate the principle of cooperation in certain group contexts.
   Behavioral studies show how the punishment of unfair behavior occurs in
   different group settings. Recent research into the neural correlates of
   punishment shows the recruitment of the reward areas and the
   gratification system, suggesting these play a central role in motivation
   and gratification for punishment of unfair behavior.}},

Title = {{Can brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) be an indicator of
   effective rehabilitation interventions in schizophrenia?}},
Journal = {{PSYCHIATRIA POLSKA}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{52}},

Abstract = {{The increasing body of evidence implies that brain-derived neurotrophic
   factor (BDNF) is the most common neurotrophin in the nervous system,
   playing an important role as an effectiveness indicator for
   rehabilitation interventions in schizophrenia patients. Currently, with
   the modem laboratory and instrumental diagnostic methods it is possible
   to diagnose deficits influencing the level of patient's functioning and
   use them as a basis for establishing individual re-adaptation programs
   for schizophrenia patients considering various forms of the therapy in
   different environments. Based on the PubMed and Scopus search tools a
   review of the available literature was performed and the paper presents
   current results of studies analyzing a relationship between selected
   rehabilitation interventions used in schizophrenia patients and changes
   in BDNF levels (a correlation between BDNF levels and physical activity
   and EEG Biofeedback therapy). Out of 240 records identified in total,
   the ones concerning the subject matter of the paper were taken into
   account. Studies concerning use of the presented method appear to
   indicate usefulness of BDNF factor in evaluation of effectiveness of
   implemented rehabilitation interventions in this group of patients.
   Changes in neurotrophin levels may indicate a synergy of the central and
   the peripheral nervous system. and high BDNF levels depending on
   physical activity and a neuromodulating effect of the PEG Biofeedback
   therapy may indicate their effectiveness. Use of various
   neurorehabilitation methods may improve the social functioning in
   schizophrenia patients. Treating BDNF as a biological indicator of those
   processes may represent an interesting hypothesis.}},

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{295-304}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: The ``autonomous sensory meridian response{''} (ASMR) is a
   neologism used to describe an internal sensation of deep relaxation and
   pleasant head tingling which is often stimulated by gentle sounds, light
   touch, and personal attention.
   Methods: An fMRI-based methodology was employed to examine the brain
   activation of subjects prescreened for ASMR-receptivity (n=10) as they
   watched ASMR videos and identified specific moments of relaxation and
   tingling.
   Results: Subjects who experienced ASMR showed significant activation in
   regions associated with both reward (NAcc) and emotional arousal (dACC
   and Insula/IFG). Brain activation during ASMR showed similarities to
   patterns previously observed in musical frisson as well as affiliative
   behaviors.
   Conclusion: This is the first study to measure the activation of various
   brain regions during ASMR and these results may help to reveal the
   mechanistic underpinnings of this sensation.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{553-565}},
Abstract = {{A dominant theory of humor comprehension suggests that people understand
   humor by first perceiving some incongruity in an expression and then
   resolving it. This is called ``the incongruity-resolution theory.{''}
   Experimental studies have investigated the neural basis of humor
   comprehension, and multiple neural substrates have been proposed;
   however, the specific substrate for incongruity resolution is still
   unknown. The reason may be that the resolution phase, despite its
   importance in humor comprehension, has not been successfully
   distinguished from the perception phase because both phases occur almost
   simultaneously. To reveal the substrate, we conducted a functional
   magnetic resonance study using 51 healthy participants. We used a
   humor-producing frame of ``Given A, I'd say B, because C{''} so as to
   focus on the resolution phase independently by suspending humor
   processing just after the perception phase. This frame allowed us to
   separate the two phases. Based on our results, incongruity resolution
   evoked positive emotion and activated the left amygdala, which is known
   to be related to positive emotion. On the basis of these findings, we
   argue that the amygdala plays an important role in humor comprehension,
   considering its functional role in emotional evaluation, particularly
   the relevance detection for incoming stimuli.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{616-627}},
Abstract = {{Using the empathizing-systemizing theory as our framework, we
   investigated how people with high self-reported empathizing (having good
   social skills and being interested in people) and systemizing (being
   interested in physical things and processes) differ in the social
   information processing of emotionally negative photographs of people
   during ``spontaneous watching{''} and emotional and cognitive empathy
   tasks. Empathizers evaluated the pictures as more emotionally touching
   and the reactions in the photographs more understandable than the
   systemizers. Compared to the empathizers, systemizers had stronger
   activations in the posterior cingulate cortex, an area related to
   cognitive empathy, as well as in the left superior temporal gyrus and
   middle frontal gyrus when watching emotional photographs spontaneously.
   During guided emotional and cognitive empathy tasks, these differences
   disappeared. However, during the emotional empathy task, higher
   systemizing was associated with weaker activation of the right inferior
   frontal gyrus /insula. Furthermore, during emotional and cognitive
   empathy tasks, empathizing was related to increased activations of the
   amygdala which were in turn related to higher behavioral ratings of
   emotional and cognitive empathy. The results suggest that empathizers
   and systemizers engage in social information processing differently:
   systemizers in more cognitive terms and empathizers with stronger
   automatic emotional reactions.}},

Abstract = {{We report 4 experiments aiming to replicate and extend the finding that

   accuracy on an episodic recollection task. Our first 3 experiments
   failed to replicate the tDCS effect in planned analyses, but post-hoc
   analyses uncovered tDCS effects on recollection accuracy during morning
   sessions. To further investigate, Experiment 4 randomly assigned
   participants to morning or afternoon sessions. As predicted, tDCS
   (compared to sham stimulation) improved recollection accuracy in the
   morning. We hypothesize that tDCS effects are easier to detect during
   nonoptimal cognitive processing times (e.g., mornings for younger
   adults). Importantly, we found both significant and null tDCS results
   across our experiments, indicating that more research is needed to
   determine the extent that anodal tDCS to left prefrontal cortex reliably
   improves recollection accuracy at different stimulation times.}},

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL AGING RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{271-283}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although engaging explicit regulatory strategies may reduce
   negative bias toward outgroup members, these strategies are cognitively
   demanding and thus may not be effective for older adults (OA) who have
   reduced cognitive resources. The current study therefore examines
   whether individual differences in cognitive capacity disrupt OA' ability
   to explicitly regulate their bias to stigmatized individuals. Methods:
   Young and OA were instructed to explicitly regulate their negative bias
   toward stigmatized individuals by using an explicit reappraisal
   strategy. Regulatory success was assessed as a function of age and
   individual differences in cognitive capacity (Experiment 1). In
   Experiment 2, the role of executive function in implementing cognitive
   reappraisal strategies was examined by using a divided attention
   manipulation. Results: Results from Experiment 1 revealed that
   individual differences in OA' cognitive capacity disrupted their ability
   to regulate their negative emotional response to stigma. In Experiment
   2, it was found that dividing attention in young adults (YA)
   significantly reduced their regulatory success as compared to YA'
   regulatory capacity in the full attention condition. As expected,
   dividing YA' attention made their performance similar to OA with
   relatively preserved cognitive capacity. Conclusion: Together, the
   results from this study demonstrated that individual differences in
   cognitive capacity predicted OA' ability to explicitly regulate their
   negative bias to a range of stigmatized individuals.}},

Journal = {{PSYCHOTHERAPY AND PSYCHOSOMATICS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{350-365}},
Abstract = {{Background: Patients suffering from panic disorder and agoraphobia are
   significantly impaired in daily life due to anxiety about getting into a
   situation due to apprehension about experiencing a panic attack,
   especially if escape may be difficult. Dysfunctional beliefs and
   behavior can be changed with cognitive behavioral therapy; however, the
   neurobiological effects of such an intervention on the anticipation and
   observation of agoraphobia-specific stimuli are unknown. Methods: We
   compared changes in neural activation by measuring the blood oxygen
   level-dependent signal of 51 patients and 51 healthy controls between
   scans before and those after treatment (group by time interaction)
   during anticipation and observation of agoraphobia-specific compared to
   neutral pictures using 3-T fMRI. Results: A significant group by time
   interaction was observed in the ventral striatum during anticipation and
   in the right amygdala during observation of agoraphobia-specific
   pictures; the patients displayed a decrease in ventral striatal
   activation during anticipation from pre- to posttreatment scans, which
   correlated with clinical improvement measured with the Mobility
   Inventory. During observation, the patients displayed decreased
   activation in the amygdala. These activational changes were not observed
   in the matched healthy controls. Conclusions: For the first time, neural
   effects of cognitive behavioral therapy were shown in patients suffering
   from panic disorder and agoraphobia using disorder-specific stimuli. The
   decrease in activation in the ventral striatum indicates that cognitive
   behavioral therapy modifies anticipatory anxiety and may ameliorate

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{20}},
Pages = {{16-23}},
Abstract = {{Error-monitoring abnormalities in stimulant-dependent individuals (SDIs)
   may be due to reduced awareness of committed errors, or to reduced
   sensitivity upon such awareness. The distinction between these
   alternatives remains largely undifferentiated, but may have substantial
   clinical relevance. We sought to better characterize the nature, and
   clinical relevance, of SDIs' error-monitoring processes by comparing
   carefully isolated neural responses during the presentation of negative
   feedback to a) stimulant dependence status and b) lifetime stimulant
   use. Forty-eight SDIs and twenty-three non-SDIs performed an fMRI-based
   time-estimation task specifically designed to isolate neural responses
   associated with the presentation (versus expectation) of contingent
   negative feedback. SDIs showed reduced dACC response compared to
   non-SDIs following the presentation of negative feedback, but only when
   error expectancies were controlled. Moreover, lifetime stimulant use
   correlated negatively with magnitude of expectancy-controlled dACC
   attenuation. While this finding was minimized after controlling for age,
   these results suggest that SDIs may be characterized by a core reduction
   in neural activity following error feedback, in the context of intact
   feedback expectancies. Correlations with lifetime stimulant use suggest
   that this neural attenuation may hold clinical significance.}},

Title = {{Distinct neural correlates of trait resilience within core
   neurocognitive networks in at-risk children and adolescents}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{20}},
Pages = {{24-34}},
Abstract = {{Background: Most children who are exposed to threat-related adversity
   (e.g., violence, abuse, neglect) are resilient - that is, they show
   stable trajectories of healthy psychological development. Despite this,
   most research on neurodevelopmental changes following adversity has
   focused on the neural correlates of negative outcomes, such as
   psychopathology. The neural correlates of trait resilience in pediatric
   populations are unknown, and it is unclear whether they are distinct
   from those related to adversity exposure and the absence of negative
   outcomes (e.g., depressive symptomology).
   Methods: This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study reports
   on a diverse sample of 55 children and adolescents (ages 6-17 years)
   recruited from a range of stressful environments (e.g., lower income,
   threat-related adversity exposure). Participants completed a multi-echo
   multi-band resting-state fMRI scan and self-report measures of trait
   resilience and emotion-related symptomology (e.g., depressive symptoms).
   Resting-state data were submitted to an independent component analysis
   (ICA) to identify core neurocognitive networks (salience and emotion
   network {[}SEN], default mode network {[}DMN], central executive network
   {[}CEN]). We tested for links among trait resilience and dynamic (i.e.,
   time-varying) as well as conventional static (i.e., averaged across the
   entire session) resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of core
   neurocognitive networks.
   Results: Youth with higher trait resilience spent a lower fraction of
   time in a particular dynamic rsFC state, characterized by heightened
   rsFC between the anterior DMN and right CEN. Within this state, trait
   resilience was associated with lower rsFC of the SEN with the right CEN
   and anterior DMN. There were no associations among trait resilience and
   conventional static rsFC. Importantly, although more resilient youth
   reported lower depressive symptoms, the effects of resilience on rsFC
   were independent of depressive symptoms and adversity exposure.
   Conclusions: The present study is the first to report on the neural
   correlates of trait resilience in youth, and offers initial insight into
   potential adaptive patterns of brain organization in the context of
   environmental stressors. Understanding the neural dynamics underlying
   positive adaptation to early adversity will aid in the development of
   interventions that focus on strengthening resilience rather than
   mitigating already-present psychological problems.}},

Title = {{Hippocampal functional connectivity is related to self-reported
   cognitive concerns in breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant therapy}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{20}},
Pages = {{110-118}},
Abstract = {{Nearly three out of four survivors experience Cancer-Related Cognitive
   Impairment (CRCI) for months or years following treatment. Both clinical
   and animal studies point to the hippocampus as a likely brain region
   affected in CRCI, however no previous study has investigated the
   functional connectivity of the hippocampus in CRCI. We compared
   hippocampal connectivity in cancer survivors and healthy controls and
   tested the relationship between functional connectivity differences and
   measures of objective and subjective cognition. Exploratory analysis of
   inflammatory markers was conducted in a small subset of participants as
   well. FMRI data were acquired during a memory task from 16 breast cancer
   survivors and 17 controls. The NIH Toolbox was used to assess cognitive
   performance and Neuro-QoL was used to measure self-reported cognitive
   concerns. Whole-brain group-level comparisons identified clusters with
   different connectivity to the hippocampus in survivors versus controls
   during task. Average connectivity was extracted from clusters of
   significant difference between the groups and correlated with cognitive
   performance and subjective report. Survivors performed worse on a test
   of episodic memory and reported greater cognitive concern than controls.
   Exploratory analysis found higher IL6 in cancer survivors compared to
   controls. Cancer survivors demonstrated higher connectivity of
   hippocampus with left cuneus, left lingual, left precuneus, and right
   middle prefrontal gyrus compared with controls. In survivors, higher
   task-related hippocampal-cortical connectivity was related to worse
   subjective measures of cognitive concern. Of the four significant
   clusters, higher connectivity of the precuneus with hippocampus was
   significantly associated with worse cognitive concern in survivors. The
   observed greater hippocampal-cortical connectivity in survivors compared
   to controls is the first reported fMRI biomarker of subjective concern,
   and may represent a compensatory response to cancer and its treatments.
   This compensation could explain, in part, the subjective feelings of
   cognitive impairment that were reported by survivors.}},

   and prefrontal-amygdala functional circuitry}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{20}},
Pages = {{267-274}},
Abstract = {{Our brain during distinct developmental phases may show differential
   responses to perceived psychological stress, yet existing research
   specifically examining neurodevelopmental changes in stress processing
   is scarce. To fill in this research gap, this functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) study examined the relationship between
   perceived stress and resting-state neural connectivity patterns among 67
   healthy volunteers belonging to three age groups (adolescents, young
   adults and adults), who were supposed to be at separate
   neurodevelopmental phases and exhibit different affect regulatory
   processes in the brain. While the groups showed no significant
   difference in self-reported general perceived stress levels, the
   functional connectivity between amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex (vmPFC) was positively and negatively correlated with perceived
   stress in adolescents and young adults respectively, while no
   significant correlations were observed in adults. Furthermore, among
   adolescents, the causal functional interaction between amygdala and
   vmPFC exhibited bottom-up connectivity, and that between amygdala and
   subgenual anterior cingulate cortex exhibited top-down connectivity,
   both of which changed to bilateral directions, i.e. both bottom-up and
   top-down connections, in both young adults and adults, supporting the
   notion that the amygdala and prefrontal cortical circuitries undergo
   functional reorganizations during brain development. These novel
   findings have important clinical implications in treating stress-related
   affective disorders in young individuals.}},

   biological motion in schizophrenia}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{20}},
Pages = {{380-387}},
Abstract = {{Social perceptual deficits in schizophrenia are well established. Recent
   work suggests that the ability to extract social information from bodily
   cues is reduced in patients. However, little is known about the
   neurobiological mechanisms underlying this deficit. In the current
   study, 20 schizophrenia patients and 16 controls completed two tasks
   using point-light animations during fMRI: a basic biological motion task
   and an emotion in biological motion task. The basic biological motion
   task was used to localize activity in posterior superior temporal sulcus
   (pSTS), a critical region for biological motion perception. During the
   emotion in biological motion task, participants viewed brief videos
   depicting happiness, fear, anger, or neutral emotions and were asked to
   decide which emotion was portrayed. Activity in pSTS and amygdala was
   interrogated during this task. Results indicated that patients showed
   overall reduced activation compared to controls in pSTS and at a trend
   level in amygdala across emotions, despite similar task performance.
   Further, a functional connectivity analysis revealed that controls, but
   not patients, showed significant positive connectivity between pSTS and
   left frontal regions as well as bilateral angular gyrus during the
   emotion in biological motion task. These findings indicate that
   schizophrenia patients show aberrant neural activity and functional
   connectivity when extracting complex social information from simple
   motion stimuli, which may contribute to social perception deficits in
   this disorder.}},

Title = {{Insight and emotion regulation in schizophrenia: A brain activation and
   functional connectivity study}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{20}},
Pages = {{762-771}},
Abstract = {{Background: Insight is impaired in the majority of schizophrenia
   patients. The exact neural correlates of impaired insight remain
   unclear. We assume that the ability to regulate emotions contributes to
   having good clinical insight, as patients should be able to regulate
   their emotional state in such a way that they can adapt adequately in
   order to cope with impaired functioning and negative stigma associated
   with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Numerous studies have shown emotional
   dysregulation in schizophrenia. We investigated the association between
   insight and brain activation and connectivity during emotion regulation.
   Methods: Brain activation during emotion regulation was measured with
   functional MRI in 30 individuals with schizophrenia. Two emotion
   regulation strategies were examined: cognitive reappraisal and
   expressive suppression. Clinical insight was measured with the Schedule
   for the Assessment of Insight - Expanded, and cognitive insight was
   measured with the Beck Cognitive Insight Scale. Whole brain random
   effects multiple regression analyses were conducted to assess the
   relation between brain activation during emotion regulation and insight.
   Generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) was used to
   investigate the relation between task related connectivity and insight.
   Results: No significant associations were found between insight and
   neural correlates of cognitive reappraisal. For clinical insight and
   suppression, significant positive associations were found between
   symptom relabeling and activation in the left striatum, thalamus and
   insula, right insula and caudate, right pre-and postcentral gyrus, left
   superior occipital gyrus and cuneus and right middle and superior
   occipital gyrus and cuneus. Furthermore, reduced clinical insight was
   associated with more connectivity between midline medial frontal gyrus
   and right middle occipital gyrus. For cognitive insight and suppression,
   significant positive associations were found between self-reflectiveness
   and activation in pre-and postcentral gyrus and left middle cingulate
   gyrus.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest an association between the capacity to
   relabel symptoms and activation of brain systems involved in
   cognitive-emotional control and visual processing of negative stimuli.
   Furthermore, poorer self-reflectiveness may be associated with brain
   systems subserving control and execution.}},

Title = {{Draining the pond and catching the fish: Uncovering the ecosystem of
   auditory verbal hallucinations}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{20}},
Pages = {{830-843}},
Abstract = {{The various models proposed for the mediation of auditory verbal
   hallucinations (AVH) implicate a considerable number of brain areas and
   mechanisms. To establish which of those mechanisms are actually involved
   in the mediation of AVH, we developed a novel method to analyze
   functional MRI data, which allows for the detection of the full network
   of mutually interacting brain states, and the identification of those
   states that are relevant to the mediation of AVH, while applying a
   minimum number of preconceived assumptions. This method is comparable to
   the draining of a pond to lay bare the full ecosystem that affects the
   presence of a particular fish species. We used this model to analyze the
   fMRI data of 85 psychotic patients experiencing AVH. The data were
   decomposed into 98 independent components (ICs) representing all major
   functions active in the brain during scanning. ICs involved in mediating
   AVH were identified by associating their time series with the
   hallucination time series as provided by subjects within the scanner.
   Using graph theory, a network of interacting ICs was created, which was
   clustered into IC modules. We used causal reasoning software to
   determine the direction of links in this network, and discover the chain
   of events that leads to the conscious experience of hallucinations.
   Hallucinatory activity was linked to three of the seven IC clusters and
   11 of the 98 ICs. ICs with the most influential roles in producing
   AVH-related activity were those within the so-called salience network
   (comprising the anterior cingulate gyrus, right insula, Broca's
   homologue, premotor cortex, and supramarginal gyrus). Broca's area and
   the cerebellar regions were significantly, but more distantly involved
   in the mediation of AVH. These results support the notion that AVH are
   largely mediated by the salience network. We therefore propose that the
   mediation of AVH in the context of schizophrenia spectrum disorders
   involves the attribution of an excess of negative salience by
   anterior-cingulate areas to linguistic input from Broca's right
   homologue, followed by subsequent processing errors in areas further `
   downstream' the causal chain of events. We provide a detailed account of
   the origin of AVH for this patient group, and make suggestions for
   selective interventions directed at the most relevant brain areas.}},

Abstract = {{Vestibular neuritis (VN) is characterised by acute vertigo due to a
   sudden loss of unilateral vestibular function. A considerable proportion
   of VN patients proceed to develop chronic symptoms of dizziness,
   including visually induced dizziness, specifically during head turns.
   Here we investigated whether the development of such poor clinical
   outcomes following VN, is associated with abnormal visuo-vestibular
   cortical processing. Accordingly, we applied functional magnetic
   resonance imaging to assess brain responses of chronic VN patients and
   compared these to controls during both congruent (co-directional) and
   incongruent (opposite directions) visuo-vestibular stimulation (i.e.
   emulating situations that provoke symptoms in patients). We observed a
   focal significant difference in BOLD signal in the primary visual cortex
   V1 between patients and controls in the congruent condition (small
   volume corrected level of p < .05 FWE). Importantly, this reduced BOLD
   signal in V1 was negatively correlated with functional status measured
   with validated clinical questionnaires. Our findings suggest that
   central compensation and in turn clinical outcomes in VN are partly
   mediated by adaptive mechanisms associated with the early visual cortex.}},

Title = {{Using fMRI and machine learning to predict symptom improvement following
   cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{20}},
Pages = {{1053-1061}},
Abstract = {{Cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis (CBTp) involves helping
   patients to understand and reframe threatening appraisals of their
   psychotic experiences to reduce distress and increase functioning.
   Whilst CBTp is effective for many, it is not effective for all patients
   and the factors predicting a good outcome remain poorly understood.
   Machine learning is a powerful approach that allows new predictors to be
   identified in a data-driven way, which can inform understanding of the
   mechanisms underlying therapeutic interventions, and ultimately make
   predictions about symptom improvement at the individual patient level.
   Thirty-eight patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia completed a
   social affect task during functional MRI. Multivariate pattern analysis
   assessed whether treatment response in those receiving CBTp (n = 22)
   could be predicted by pre-therapy neural responses to facial affect that
   was either threat-related (ambiguous `neutral' faces perceived as
   threatening in psychosis, in addition to angry and fearful faces) or
   prosocial (happy faces). The models predicted improvement in psychotic
   (r = 0.63, p = 0.003) and affective (r = 0.31, p = 0.05) symptoms
   following CBTp, but not in the treatment-as-usual group (n = 16).
   Psychotic symptom improvement was predicted by neural responses to
   threat-related affect across sensorimotor and frontal-limbic regions,
   whereas affective symptom improvement was predicted by neural responses
   to fearful faces only as well as prosocial affect across sensorimotor
   and frontal regions. These findings suggest that CBTp most likely
   improves psychotic and affective symptoms in those endorsing more
   threatening appraisals and mood-congruent processing biases,
   respectively, which are explored and reframed as part of the therapy.
   This study improves our understanding of the neurobiology of treatment
   response and provides a foundation that will hopefully lead to greater
   precision and tailoring of the interventions offered to patients.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{20}},
Pages = {{1115-1122}},
Abstract = {{Background: Exaggerated reactivity to acute psychosocial stress is
   associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic
   disease. A dysfunction of the cortico-limbic network coordinating the
   peripheral adaptation to acute stress exposure may constitute a brain
   mechanism underlying this association. We opted to characterize the
   changes of this network associated with acute psychosocial stress
   exposure in individuals with low and high cardiometabolic risk (CMR).
   Methods: In 57 subjects without overt cardiac or cerebral disease, the
   Framingham risk score and presence/absence of type 2 diabetes or
   metabolic syndrome defined CMR. Psychosocial stress was induced during
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain activity by an
   established social threat paradigm. Measurements of heart rate, blood
   pressure and saliva cortisol quantified the peripheral stress reaction.
   Regression analyses for the anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus,
   amygdala, insula and regulatory prefrontal regions evaluated the
   association of stress-associated brain activation and CMR.
   Results: Psychosocial stress exposure was associated with an increased
   activity of a brain network including anterior and posterior cingulate
   cortex, putamen, insula, parahippocampus and right hippocampus.
   Psychosocial stress-associated brain activation did neither covary with
   Framingham risk score nor differ between groups with low or high CMR.
   Conclusion: Exposure to acute psychosocial stress induces the activation
   of a well-defined cortico-limbic network. However, we did not find an
   association between CMR and this network's stress reactivity.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To identify whether the amplitude of low-frequency
   fluctuations (ALFF) analysis has the potential to serve as a biological
   marker to detect alcohol-induced spontaneous brain activities and
   distinguish the patients with alcohol dependence from the healthy
   subjects.
   Methods: We utilized the ALFF analysis to report on the alcohol-induced
   spontaneous brain activities in 29 patients with alcohol dependence (9
   female, 20 male) relative to 29 status-matched healthy subjects (11
   female, 18 male). Receiver operating characteristic curve was used to
   test the ability of the ALFF analysis in discriminating the patients
   with alcohol dependence from the healthy subjects. Pearson correlation
   was used to evaluate the relationships between the signal value of those
   ALFF differences in brain areas and behavioral characteristics.
   Results: Alcohol-induced brain differences located in the right inferior
   parietal lobule and right supplementary motor area with significant
   higher ALFF values, and in the left precuneus and bilateral cerebellum
   posterior lobe with lower ALFF values. The movement-related areas were
   significantly correlated with each other (P<0.05). Receiver operating
   characteristic curve revealed good area under the curve values (mean,
   0.86 +/- 0.079; 0.774-0.951) of the ALFF differences in those specific
   brain areas, as well as high degree of sensitivities (mean, 80.84\%+/-

   83.32\%+/- 9.31\%; 70.8\%-95.8\% or 84.16\%+/- 8\%; 75\%-95.8\%).
   Conclusion: The ALFF analysis may serve as a biological indicator to
   detect the spontaneous brain activities in patients with alcohol
   dependence. The prefrontal-parietall-cerebellar circuit appears to be
   disturbed by long-term alcoholism in patients with alcohol dependence.}},

Abstract = {{Recent progress in resting-state neuroimaging demonstrates that the
   brain exhibits highly individualized patterns of functional
   connectivity-a ``connectotype.{''} How these individualized patterns may
   be constrained by environment and genetics is unknown. Here we ask
   whether the connectotype is familial and heritable. Using a novel
   approach to estimate familiality via a machine-learning framework, we
   analyzed resting-state fMRI scans from two well-characterized samples of
   child and adult siblings. First we show that individual connectotypes
   were reliably identified even several years after the initial scanning
   timepoint. Familial relationships between participants, such as siblings
   versus those who are unrelated, were also accurately characterized. The
   connectotype demonstrated substantial heritability driven by high-order
   systems including the fronto-parietal, dorsal attention, ventral
   attention, cingulo-opercular, and default systems. This work suggests
   that shared genetics and environment contribute toward producing
   complex, individualized patterns of distributed brain activity, rather
   than constraining local aspects of function. These insights offer new
   strategies for characterizing individual aberrations in brain function
   and evaluating heritability of brain networks.}},

Abstract = {{Major depression is associated with persistent negative affect,
   increased mental rumination, difficulties in concentration and
   attention, and impaired ability to interact with people. In this paper,
   we review the cerebral imaging data supporting these different
   depressive symptoms at neural level. Beyond neurobiological features,
   brain imaging has implicated several brain regions and networks in the
   pathophysiology of major depression. Among these regions, the subgenual
   cortex, the anterior right insula and the medial prefrontal cortex play
   major role in precipitating a depressive episode and in maintaining
   depressive symptoms. Those areas partly belong to the default mode
   system and to the salience network. We propose here a neural working
   model suggesting that depression is marked by increased sensitivity to
   negative social signal and by problem to adequately allocate attentional
   resources in responses to social stress. This model may pave the way to
   the development of preventive treatment in subjects at risk for
   depression.}},

Abstract = {{Self-compassion has been shown to have significant relationships with
   psychological health and well-being. Despite the increasing growth of
   research on the topic, no studies to date have investigated how
   self-compassion relates to neural responses to threats to the self. To
   investigate whether self-compassion relates to threat-regulatory
   mechanisms at the neural level of analysis, we conducted a functional
   MRI study in a sample of college-aged students. We hypothesized that
   self-compassion would relate to greater negative connectivity between
   the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) and amygdala during a social
   feedback task. Interestingly, we found a negative correlation between
   self-compassion and VMPFC-amygdala functional connectivity as predicted;
   however, this seemed to be due to low levels of self-compassion relating
   to greater positive connectivity in this circuit (rather than high
   levels of self-compassion relating to more negative connectivity). We
   also found significant relationships with multiple subcomponents of
   self-compassion (Common Humanity, Self-Judgment). These results shed
   light on how self-compassion might affect neural responses to threat and
   informs our understanding of the basic psychological regulatory
   mechanisms linking a lack of self-compassion with poor mental health.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions with conspecifics are key to any social species. In order
   to navigate this social world, it is crucial for individuals to learn
   from and about others. From learning new skills by observing parents
   perform them tomaking complex collective decisions, understanding the
   mechanisms underlying social cognitive processes has been of
   considerable interest to psychologists and neuroscientists. Here, we
   review studies that have used computational modelling techniques,
   combined with neuroimaging, to shed light on how people learn and make
   decisions in social contexts. As opposed to standard social neuroscience
   methods, the computational approach allows one to directly examine where
   in the brain particular computations, as estimated by models of
   behavior, are implemented. Findings suggest that people use several
   strategies tolearn from others: vicarious reward learning, where one
   learns from observing the reward outcomes of another agent; action
   imitation, which relies on encoding a prediction error between the
   expected and actual actions of the other agent; and social inference,
   where one learns by inferring the goals and intentions of others. These
   computations are implemented indistinct neural networks, which may be
   recruited adaptively depending on task demands, the environment and

Pages = {{648-666}},
Abstract = {{Relational Models Theory or RMT proposes that there are four universal
   ways in which socio-economic relations can be organized. According to
   the RMT, each of its four relational models (Communal Sharing, Authority
   Ranking, Equality Matching, and Market Pricing) is associated with a
   distinct cognitive representation, with a cumulative pattern in which
   each relational model is a superset of the next lower model. This report
   for the first time uses a combination of cognitive and the social
   neuroscience to put this model to the test.RMT proposes that members of
   every culture use all four relational models, just in different
   proportions. It should therefore be possible to study their neural
   correlates in a mono-cultural sample. In this study, thirty-nine
   European-American students were imaged in a 3T Siemens Trio with a
   24-channel head coil while rating the extent to which each relational
   model organized relationships with each of thirty-two
   acquaintances/friend/relatives in a boxcar design. FreeSurfer Functional
   Analysis Stream (FS-FAST) analyses revealed distinct patterns of

   follow a cumulative hierarchical pattern, suggestive that this aspect of

Abstract = {{How do we decide to keep interacting (e.g., stay) with a social partner
   or to switch (e.g., leave) to another? This paper investigated the
   neural mechanisms of stay/leave decision-making. We hypothesized that
   these decisions fit within a framework of value-based decision-making,
   and explored four potential mechanisms underlying a hypothesized bias to
   stay. Twenty-six participants underwent functional Magnetic Resonance
   Imaging (fMRI) while completing social and nonsocial versions of a
   stay/leave decision-making task. On each trial, participants chose
   between four alternative options, after which they received a monetary
   reward. Crucially, in the social condition, reward magnitude was
   ostensibly determined by the generosity of social partners, whereas in
   the nonsocial condition, reward amounts were ostensibly determined in a
   pre-programmed manner. Results demonstrated that participants were more
   likely to stay with options of relatively high expected value, with
   these values updated through Reinforcement Learning mechanisms and
   represented neurally within ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Moreover, we
   demonstrated that greater brain activity in ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex, caudate nucleus, and septo-hypothalamic regions for social
   versus nonsocial decisions to stay may underlie a bias towards staying
   with social partners in particular. These findings complement existing
   social psychological theories by investigating the neural mechanisms of
   actual stay/leave decisions.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{718-738}},
Abstract = {{Previous research has shown that specific goals and intentions influence
   a person's allocation of social attention. From a neural viewpoint, a
   growing body of evidence suggests that the inferior fronto-parietal
   network, including the mirror neuron system, plays a role in the
   planning and the understanding of motor intentions. However, it is
   unclear whether and when the mirror neuron system plays a role in social
   intentions. Combining a behavioral task with electrical neuroimaging in
   22 healthy male participants, the current study investigates whether the
   temporal brain dynamic of the mirror neuron system differs during two
   types of social intentions i.e., lust vs. romantic intentions. Our
   results showed that 62\% of the stimuli evoking lustful intentions also
   evoked romantic intentions, and both intentions were sustained by
   similar activations of the inferior frontal gyrus and the inferior
   parietal lobule/angular gyrus for the first 432ms after stimulus onset.
   Intentions to not love or not lust, on the other hand, were
   characterized by earlier differential activations of the inferior
   fronto-parietal network i.e., as early as 244ms after stimulus onset.
   These results suggest that the mirror neuron system may not only code
   for the motor correlates of intentions, but also for the social meaning
   of intentions and its valence at both early/automatic and later/more
   elaborative stages of information processing.}},

Abstract = {{The role of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in moral decision-making is
   well established. However, OFC activity is highly context dependent. It
   is affected by the extent to which choices are morally justified and
   whom they concern. In the current study, we specifically focus on
   contextual factors and investigate the differential role of the OFC
   during justified and unjustified violence towards ingroup versus
   outgroup members. Muslims were chosen as the outgroup, as they are
   currently stereotypically seen as an outgroup and a potential threat by
   some Non-Muslims. Importantly, we also introduce a context where
   participants are the actual agents responsible for doing harm. During
   fMRI scanning, Non-Muslim participants had to decide to either shoot a
   Non-Muslim (i.e., ingroup member) or Muslim (outgroup member) depending

   Neuroimaging results showed increased activation in the lateral OFC

Title = {{Personality modulates amygdala and insula connectivity during humor
   appreciation: An event-related fMRI study}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{756-768}},
Abstract = {{Previous research and theory implicate that personality traits, such as
   extraversion and neuroticism, influence the processing of humor, as
   indicated by alterations in the activation of fronto-temporal and
   mesocorticolimbic brain regions during humor processing. In the current
   study, we sought to complement these findings by testing whether
   inter-individual differences in functional connectivity of humor-related
   brain regions are modulated by stable personality characteristics during
   humor processing. Using fMRI techniques, we studied 19 healthy subjects
   during the processing of standardized humorous and neutral cartoons. In
   order to isolate the specific effects of humor appreciation, subjective
   funniness ratings, collected during the scanning procedure, were
   implemented in the analysis as parametric modulation. Two distinct
   clusters in the right amygdala and the left insula were identified.
   Seed-to-voxel connectivity analysis investigating the effects of
   personality on inter-individual differences in functional connectivity
   revealed that amygdala and insula connectivity with brain areas
   previously related to humor comprehension (e.g. middle temporal gyrus)
   and appreciation (e.g. caudate nucleus) were significantly modulated by
   personality dimensions. These results underscore the sensitivity of
   humor processing to moderating influences, such as personality, and call
   attention to the importance of brain connectivity measures for the
   investigation of inter-individual differences in the processing of
   humor.}},

Title = {{Dynamic functional network connectivity discriminates mild traumatic
   brain injury through machine learning}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{19}},
Pages = {{30-37}},
Abstract = {{Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) can result in symptoms that affect a
   person's cognitive and social abilities. Improvements in diagnostic
   methodologies are necessary given that current clinical techniques have
   limited accuracy and are solely based on self-reports. Recently, resting
   state functional network connectivity (FNC) has shown potential as an
   important imaging modality for the development of mTBI biomarkers. The
   present work explores the use of dynamic functional network connectivity
   (dFNC) for mTBI detection. Forty eight mTBI patients (24 males) and
   age-gender matched healthy controls were recruited. We identified a set
   of dFNC states and looked at the possibility of using each state to
   classify subjects in mTBI patients and healthy controls. A linear
   support vector machine was used for classification and validated using
   leave-one-out cross validation. One of the dFNC states achieved a high
   classification performance of 92\% using the area under the curve
   method. A series of t-test analysis revealed significant dFNC increases
   between cerebellum and sensorimotor networks. This significant increase
   was detected in the same dFNC state useful for classification. Results
   suggest that dFNC can be used to identify optimal dFNC states for
   classification excluding those that does not contain useful features.}},

   clinical-high risk for psychosis}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{19}},
Pages = {{137-146}},
Abstract = {{The cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit (CTCC) has been implicated in
   schizophrenia. However, this work has been limited to structural and
   functional networks, or behavior, and to date, has not been evaluated in
   clinical high-risk (CHR) youth, a group at elevated risk for psychosis.
   Here, we used an innovative learning paradigm known to activate the CTCC
   (while limiting potential motor confounds) to evaluate CHR and healthy
   control individuals during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   20 CHR and 21 healthy control individuals performed a second-order rule
   learning task while undergoing fMRI. This was preceded and followed by
   the paradigm under dual-task conditions. In addition, all participants
   underwent structured clinical interviews to confirm a prodromal syndrome
   and assess symptom severity. The rate of learning did not differ between
   groups. However, the CHR group consistently performed more poorly under
   dual-task conditions, and exhibited a higher dual-task cost after
   learning. Further, learning rate in the CHR group was significantly
   associated with symptom severity. Both groups showed activation in
   regions of the CTCC. During early learning, the CHR group exhibited
   greater engagement of regions of the default mode network, suggesting
   that they were less able to engage the appropriate task positive
   networks. During late learning, there were qualitative differences
   wherein controls showed more prefrontal cortical activation. Higher
   order cognitive rule learning is related to symptom severity in CHR
   individuals. fMRI revealed that CHR individuals may not reliably
   disengage the default mode network, and during late learning high-risk
   youth may not engage the prefrontal cortex as extensively as controls.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},

Abstract = {{MIR137 gene has been repeatedly reported as a schizophrenia risk gene in
   genome-wide association studies (GWAS). A polymorphism (rs1625579) at
   the MIR137 gene has been associated with both neural activation and
   behavioral performance during a working memory task. This study examined
   MIR137' s associations with task-related (N-back working memory) fMRI,
   resting state fMRI, and diffusion tensor images (DTI) data in 177
   healthy adults. We found less deactivation of the PCC in risk allele
   homozygotes (TT) as compared to the GT heterozygotes (cluster size = 630
   voxels, cluster level P-FWE < 0.001) during the N-back task, which
   replicated previous findings. Using the identified cluster within the
   PCC as the seed, we further found decreased functional connectivity
   between the PCC and the anterior cingulate cortex and its adjacent
   medial prefrontal cortex (ACC/MPFC) in risk allele homozygotes during
   both resting state (cluster size = 427 voxels, cluster level P-FWE =
   0.001) and the N-back task (cluster size = 73 voxels, cluster level
   P-FWE = 0.05). Finally, an analysis of our DTI data showed decreased
   white matter integrity of the posterior cingulum in risk allele
   homozygotes (cluster size = 214 voxels, cluster level P-FWE = 0.03).
   Taken together, rs1625579 seems to play an important role in both
   functional and structural connectivity between the PCC and the ACC/MPFC,
   which may serve as the brain mechanisms for the link between rs1625579
   and schizophrenia.}},

Title = {{Patients with a severe prolonged Disorder of Consciousness can show
   classical EEG responses to their own name compared with others' names}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{19}},
Pages = {{311-319}},
Abstract = {{Patients in Vegetative State (VS), also known as Unresponsive
   Wakefulness State (UWS) are deemed to be unaware of themselves or their
   environment. This is different from patients diagnosed with Minimally
   Conscious state (MCS), who can have intermittent awareness. In both
   states, there is a severe impairment of consciousness; these disorders
   are referred to as disorders of consciousness (DOC) and if the state is
   prolonged, pDOC. There is growing evidence that some patients who are
   behaviourally in VS/UWS can show neural activation to environmental
   stimuli and that this response can be detected using functional brain
   imaging (fMRI/PET) and electroencephalography (EEG). Recently, it has
   also been suggested that a more reliable detection of brain
   responsiveness and hence a more reliable differentiation between VS/UWS
   and MCS requires person-centred and person-specific stimuli, such as the
   subject's own name stimulus.
   In this study we obtained event related potential data (ERP) from 12
   healthy subjects and 16 patients in pDOC, five of whom were in the
   VS/UWS and 11 in the Minimally Conscious State (MCS). We used as the ERP
   stimuli the subjects' own name, others' names and reversed other names.
   We performed a sensor level analysis using Statistical Parametric
   Mapping (SPM) software. Using this paradigm in 4 DOC patients (3 in MCS,
   and 1 in VS/UWS) we detected a statistically significant difference in
   EEG response to their own name versus other peoples' names with ERP
   latencies (similar to 300 ms and similar to 700 ms post stimuli). Some
   of these differences were similar to those found in a control group of
   healthy subjects.
   This study shows the feasibility of using self-relevant stimuli such as

Title = {{Altered perspective-dependent brain activation while viewing hands and
   associated imitation difficulties in individuals with autism spectrum
   disorder}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{19}},
Pages = {{384-395}},
Abstract = {{Background: Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) appear to
   have a unique awareness of their own body, which may be associated with
   difficulties of gestural interaction. In typically developing (TD)
   individuals, the perception of body parts is processed in various brain
   regions. For instance, activation of the lateral occipito-temporal
   cortex (LOTC) is known to depend on perspective (i.e., first-or
   third-person perspective) and identity (i.e., own vs. another person's
   body). In the present study, we examined how perspective and identity
   affect brain activation in individuals with ASD, and how perspective-and
   identity-dependent brain activation is associated with gestural
   imitation abilities.
   Methods: Eighteen young adults with ASD and 18 TD individuals
   participated in an fMRI study in which the participants observed their
   own or another person's hands from the first-and third-person
   perspectives. We examined whether the brain activation associated with
   perspective and identity was altered in individuals with ASD.
   Furthermore, we identified the brain regions the activity of which
   correlated with gestural imitation difficulties in individuals with ASD.
   Results: In the TD group, the left LOTC was more strongly activated by
   viewing a hand from the third-person perspective compared with the
   first-person perspective. This perspective effect in the left LOTC was
   significantly attenuated in the ASD group. We also observed significant
   group differences in the perspective effect in the medial prefrontal
   cortex (mPFC). Correlation analysis revealed that the perspective effect
   in the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and cerebellum was associated with
   the gestural imitation ability in individuals with ASD.
   Conclusions: Our study suggests that atypical visual self-body
   recognition in individuals with ASD is associated with an altered
   perspective effect in the LOTC and mPFC, which are thought to be
   involved in the physical and core selves, respectively. Furthermore, the
   gestural imitation difficulty in individuals with ASD might be
   associated with the altered activation in the IPL and cerebellum, but
   not in the LOTC. These findings shed light on common and divergent
   neural mechanisms underlying atypical visual self-body awareness and
   gestural interaction in ASD.}},

Abstract = {{Paleoneurology deals with the study of brain anatomy in fossil species,
   as inferred from the morphology of their endocranial features. When
   compared with other living and extinct hominids, Homo sapiens is
   characterized by larger parietal bones and, according to the
   paleoneurological evidence, also by larger parietal lobes. The dorsal
   elements of the posterior parietal cortex (superior parietal lobules,
   precuneus, and intraparietal sulcus) may be involved in these
   morphological changes. This parietal expansion was also associated with
   an increase in the corresponding vascular networks, and possibly with
   increased heat loads. Only H. sapiens has a specific early ontogenetic
   stage in which brain form achieves such globular appearance. In adult
   modern humans, the precuneus displays remarkable variation, being
   largely responsible for the longitudinal parietal size. The precuneus is
   also much more expanded in modern humans than in chimpanzees. Parietal
   expansion is not influenced by brain size in fossil hominids or living
   primates. Therefore, our larger parietal cortex must be interpreted as a
   derived feature. Spatial models suggest that the dorsal and anterior
   areas of the precuneus might be involved in these derived morphological
   variations. These areas are crucial for visuospatial integration, and
   are sensitive to both genetic and environmental influences. This article
   reviews almost 20 years of my collaborations on human parietal lobe
   evolution, integrating functional craniology, paleoneurology, and
   evolutionary neuroanatomy. (C) 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Abstract = {{Cooperation can be viewed as a social norm that is expected in our
   society. In this work, a framework based on spatial public goods game
   theory is established to study how peer pressure and incentive
   mechanisms can influence the evolution of cooperation. A unified model
   with adjustable parameters is developed to represent the effects of pure
   Personal Mechanism, Personal Mechanism with peer pressure and Social
   Mechanism, which demonstrates that when the sum of rewards plus the peer
   pressure felt by defectors is larger than the effective cost of
   cooperation, cooperation can prevail. As the peer pressure is caused by
   other cooperators in a game, group size and network structure play an
   important role. In particular, larger group size and more heterogeneous
   structured population can make defectors feel more peer pressure, which
   will promote the evolution and sustainment of cooperation. Copyright (C)

Journal = {{ACTA NEUROBIOLOGIAE EXPERIMENTALIS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{78}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{114-131}},
Abstract = {{The ability to ``read{''} the information about facial identity,
   expressed emotions, and intentions is crucial for non-verbal social
   interaction. Neuroimaging and clinical studies consequently link face
   perception with fusiform gyrus (FG) and occipital face area (OFA)
   activity. Here we investigated face processing in an adult, patient PK,
   diagnosed with both high functioning autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and
   developmental prosopagnosia (DP). Both disorders have a significant
   impact on face perception and recognition, thus creating a unique
   neurodevelopmental condition. We used eye-tracking and functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method. Eye-tracking and fMRI results
   of PK were compared to results of control subjects. Patient PK showed
   atypical gaze-fixation strategy during face perception and typical
   patterns of brain activations in the FG and OFA. However, a significant
   difference between PK and control subjects was found in the left
   anterior superior temporal sulcus/middle temporal gyrus (aSTS/MTG). In
   PK the left aSTS/MTG was hypo-activated in comparison to the control
   subjects. Additionally, functional connectivity analysis revealed
   decreased inter-hemispheric connectivity between right and left aSTS/MTG
   in `ASD and DP' patient during face recognition performance as compared
   to the control subjects. The lack of activity in the left aSTS/MTG
   observed in the case of the clinical subject, combined with the
   behavioral, eye-tracking, and neuropsychological results, suggests that
   impairment of the cognitive mechanism of face recognition involves
   higher level of processing. It seems to be related to insufficient
   access to semantic knowledge about the person when prompted by face
   stimuli.}},

Title = {{Dance Training Shapes Action Perception and Its Neural Implementation
   within the Young and Older Adult Brain}},
Journal = {{NEURAL PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Abstract = {{How we perceive others in action is shaped by our prior experience. Many
   factors influence brain responses when observing others in action,
   including training in a particular physical skill, such as sport or
   dance, and also general development and aging processes. Here, we
   investigate how learning a complex motor skill shapes neural and
   behavioural responses among a dance-naive sample of 20 young and 19
   older adults. Across four days, participants physically rehearsed one
   set of dance sequences, observed a second set, and a third set remained
   untrained. Functional MRI was obtained prior to and immediately
   following training. Participants' behavioural performance on motor and
   visual tasks improved across the training period, with younger adults
   showing steeper performance gains than older adults. At the brain level,
   both age groups demonstrated decreased sensorimotor cortical engagement
   after physical training, with younger adults showing more pronounced
   decreases in inferior parietal activity compared to older adults. Neural
   decoding results demonstrate that among both age groups, visual and
   motor regions contain experience-specific representations of new motor
   learning. By combining behavioural measures of performance with
   univariate and multivariate measures of brain activity, we can start to
   build a more complete picture of age-related changes in
   experience-dependent plasticity.}},

Title = {{Processing and regulation of negative emotions in anorexia nervosa: An
   fMRI study}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Pages = {{1-8}},
Abstract = {{Theoretical models and recent advances in the treatment of anorexia
   nervosa (AN) have increasingly focused on the role of alterations in the
   processing and regulation of emotions. To date, however, our
   understanding of these changes is still limited and reports of emotional
   dysregulation in AN have been based largely on self-report data, and
   there is a relative lack of objective experimental evidence or
   neurobiological data.
   The current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study
   investigated the hemodynamic correlates of passive viewing and voluntary
   downregulation of negative emotions by means of the reappraisal strategy
   detachment in AN patients. Detachment is regarded as adaptive regulation
   strategy associated with a reduction in emotion-related amygdala
   activity and increased recruitment of prefrontal brain regions
   associated with cognitive control processes. Emotion regulation efficacy
   was assessed via behavioral arousal ratings and fMRI activation elicited
   by an established experimental paradigm including negative images.
   Participants were instructed to either simply view emotional pictures or
   detach themselves from feelings triggered by the stimuli.
   The sample consisted of 36 predominantly adolescent female AN patients
   and a pairwise age-matched healthy control group. Behavioral and
   neuroimaging data analyses indicated a reduction of arousal and amygdala
   activity during the regulation condition for both patients and controls.
   However, compared with controls, individuals with AN showed increased
   activation in the amygdala as well as in the right dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) during the passive viewing of aversive
   compared with neutral pictures.
   These results extend previous findings indicative of altered processing
   of salient emotional stimuli in AN, but do not point to a general
   deficit in the voluntary regulation of negative emotions. Increased
   dlPFC activation in AN during passive viewing of negative stimuli is in
   line with the hypothesis that the disorder may be characterized by
   excessive self-control. Taken together, the data seem to suggest that
   reappraisal via detachment may be an effective strategy to reduce
   negative arousal for individuals with AN.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the specific mechanisms that explain why people who have
   relatives with schizophrenia (i.e., people at familial high risk; FHR)
   are more likely to develop the disorder is crucial for prevention. We
   investigated a diathesis-stress model of familial risk by testing
   whether FHR individuals under-recruit brain regions central to emotion
   regulation when exposed to social conflict, resulting in worse mood and
   symptoms following conflict. FHR and non-FHR participants listened to
   critical, neutral, and praising comments in an fMRI scanner before
   completing 4 weeks of daily-diary records. Compared to non-FHR
   individuals, FHR individuals under-recruited the bilateral dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)-a region strongly implicated in cognitive
   emotion regulation-following criticism. Furthermore, within FHR
   participants, weak DLPFC response to criticism in the laboratory task
   was associated with elevated negative mood and positive symptoms on days
   with distressing social conflicts in daily-diary assessments. Results
   extend diathesis-stress models of schizophrenia by clarifying neural and
   environmental pathways to dysregulation in FHR individuals.}},

Title = {{Brain activity for spontaneous and explicit mentalizing in adults with
   autism spectrum disorder: An fMRI study}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Pages = {{475-484}},
Abstract = {{The socio-communicative difficulties of individuals with autism spectrum
   disorder (ASD) are hypothesized to be caused by a specific deficit in
   the ability to represent one's own and others' mental states, referred
   to as Theory of Mind or mentalizing. However, many individuals with ASD
   show successful performance on explicit measures of mentalizing, and for
   this reason, the deficit is thought to be better captured by measures of
   spontaneous mentalizing. While there is initial behavioral support for
   this hypothesis, spontaneous mentalizing in ASD has not yet been studied
   at the neural level. Recent findings indicate involvement of the right
   temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) in both explicit and spontaneous
   mentalizing (Bardi et al., 2016). In the current study, we investigated
   brain activation during explicit and spontaneous mentalizing in adults
   with ASD by means of fMRI. Based on our hypothesis of a core mentalizing
   deficit in ASD, decreased rTPJ activity was expected for both forms of
   mentalizing. A group of 24 adults with ASD and 21 neurotypical controls
   carried out a spontaneous and an explicit version of the same
   mentalizing task. They watched videos in which both they themselves and
   another agent formed a belief about the location of an object (belief
   formation phase). Only in the explicit task version participants were
   instructed to report the agent's belief on some trials. At the
   behavioral level, no group differences were revealed in either of the
   task versions. A planned region-of-interest analysis of the rTPJ showed
   that this region was more active for false-than for true-belief
   formation, independent of task version, especially when the agent's
   belief had a positive content (when the agent was expecting the object).
   This effect of belief was absent in adults with ASD. A whole-brain
   analysis revealed reduced activation in the anterior middle temporal
   pole in ASD for false - versus true-belief trials, independent of task
   version. Our findings suggest neural differences between adults with ASD
   and neurotypical controls both during spontaneous and explicit
   mentalizing, and indicate the rTPJ to be crucially involved in ASD.
   Moreover, the possible role of the anterior middle temporal pole in
   disturbed mentalizing in ASD deserves further attention. The finding
   that these neural differences do not necessarily lead to differential
   performance warrants further research.}},

Abstract = {{The frontal lobes are one of the most complex brain structures involved
   in both domain-general and specific functions. The goal of this work was
   to assess the anatomical and cognitive affectations from a unique case
   with massive bilateral frontal affectation. We report the case of GC, an
   eight-year old child with nearly complete affectation of bilateral
   frontal structures and spared temporal, parietal, occipital, and
   cerebellar regions. We performed behavioral, neuropsychological, and
   imaging (MRI, DTI, fMRI) evaluations. Neurological and
   neuropsychological examinations revealed a mixed pattern of affected
   (executive control/abstraction capacity) and considerably preserved
   (consciousness, language, memory, spatial orientation, and
   socio-emotional) functions. Both structural (DTI) and functional (fMRI)
   connectivity evidenced abnormal anterior connections of the amygdala and
   parietal networks. In addition, brain structural connectivity analysis
   revealed almost complete loss of frontal connections, with atypical
   temporo-posterior pathways. Similarly, functional connectivity showed an
   aberrant frontoparietal network and relative preservation of the
   posterior part of the default mode network and the visual network. We
   discuss this multilevel pattern of behavioral, structural, and
   functional connectivity results. With its unique pattern of compromised

   constraints and challenges for neurocognitive theories.}},

Abstract = {{Psychopathic individuals are notorious for their grandiose sense of
   self-worth and disregard for the welfare of others. One potential
   psychological mechanism underlying these traits is the relative
   consideration of ``self{''} versus ``others{''}. Here we used task-based

   responses during personality trait judgments about oneself and a
   familiar other in a sample of adult male incarcerated offenders (n =
   57). Neural activity was regressed on two clusters of psychopathic
   traits: Factor 1 (e.g., egocentricity and lack of empathy) and Factor 2
   (e.g., impulsivity and irresponsibility). Contrary to our hypotheses,
   Factor 1 scores were not significantly related to neural activity during
   self- or other-judgments. However, Factor 2 traits were associated with
   diminished activation to self-judgments, in relation to other-judgments,
   in bilateral posterior cingulate cortex and right temporoparietal
   junction. These findings highlight cortical regions associated with a
   dimension of social-affective cognition that may underlie psychopathic

   rated negative affect when adopting a distant-future perspective,
   near-future perspective, or when reacting naturally. Self-report data
   revealed significant downregulation of negative affect during the
   distant-future condition, with a similar though non-significant skin
   conductance pattern. Importantly, participants who projected further
   ahead showed the greatest distress reductions. While temporal distancing
   efficacy did not vary with age, participants reporting greater reactive
   aggression showed reduced distancing efficacy, and projected themselves
   less far into the future. Findings demonstrate the importance of
   temporal extent in effective temporal distancing; shedding light on a

Abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful tool used in
   cognitive neuroscientific research. fMRI is noninvasive, safe, and
   relatively accessible, making it an ideal method to draw inferences
   about the brain-behavior relationship. When conducting fMRI research,
   scientists must consider risks associated with brain imaging. In
   particular, the risk of potentially identifying an abnormal brain
   finding in an fMRI research scan poses a complex problem that
   researchers should be prepared to address. This article illustrates how
   a social constructivism decision-making model can be used as a framework
   to guide researchers as they develop protocols to address this issue.}},

Pages = {{384-398}},
Abstract = {{Morality is an important social construct necessary for understanding
   what is right and wrong. Neuroimaging studies investigating morality
   have used a wide variety of paradigms and implicated many different
   brain areas. Yet, it remains unclear whether differences amongst
   morality tasks are the cause for such heterogeneous findings. Therefore,
   in the present study, a series of activation likelihood estimation (ALE)
   meta-analyses were conducted on 123 datasets (inclusive of 1963
   participants) to address this question. The ALE meta-analyses revealed a
   series of common brain areas associated with all moral tasks, including
   medial prefrontal cortex, lateral orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala,
   temporoparietal junction, and precuneus. However, individual and
   contrast analyses also revealed unique networks associated with each
   moral modality, suggesting that different moral tasks recruit
   specialised brain regions.}},

Abstract = {{Adhering to standard procedures (impartiality), returning favors
   (reciprocity) or giving based on individuals' needs (charity) may all be
   considered moral and/or fair ways to allocate resources. However, these
   allocation behaviors may be perceived as differently motivated, and
   their moral evaluation may make different demands on theory of mind
   (ToM) - the capacity to process information about mental states,
   including motives. In Studies 1 and 2, we examined participants' moral
   judgments of allocations based on (1) impartiality, (2) reciprocity, (3)
   charity and (4) unspecified criteria as depicted in vignettes, as well
   as participants' perceptions of allocators' motivations. In Study 3, we
   used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate how brain
   regions for ToM were recruited during moral evaluation of the same
   vignettes. Reciprocity and charity were processed similarly, in that
   they recruited ToM regions to the same extent, i.e., precuneus, dorsal
   and ventral medial prefrontal cortex and left temporoparietal junction
   (LTPJ). In turn, impartiality and the unspecified condition were
   processed similarly, recruiting the same ToM regions to a lesser extent.
   Nevertheless, reciprocity elicited greater activity relative to
   impartiality and unspecified in the ToM regions of interest. Overall,
   evaluations of different allocation behaviors depend differently on ToM,
   with charity and reciprocity eliciting greater attention to individuals'
   unique states and motivations.}},

   disorder: a meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging
   studies}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISEASE AND TREATMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{14}},
Pages = {{1183-1198}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Impairments in emotion regulation, and more specifically in
   cognitive reappraisal, are thought to play a key role in the
   pathogenesis of anxiety disorders. However, the available evidence on
   such deficits is inconsistent. To further illustrate the neurobiological
   underpinnings o f anxiety disorder, the present meta-analysis summarizes
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) findings for cognitive
   reappraisal tasks and investigates related brain areas.
   Methods: We performed a comprehensive series of meta-analyses of
   cognitive reappraisal fMRI studies contrasting patients with anxiety
   disorder with healthy control (HC) subjects, employing an anisotropic
   effect-size signed differential mapping approach. We also conducted a
   subgroup analysis of medication status, anxiety disorder subtype,
   data-processing software, and MRI field strengths. Meta-regression was
   used to explore the effects of demographics and clinical
   characteristics. Eight studies, with 11 datasets including 219 patients
   with anxiety disorder and 227 HC, were identified.
   Results: Compared with EIG, patients with anxiety disorder showed
   relatively decreased activation of the bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal
   cortex (dmPFC), bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC),
   bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA), left ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex (vmPFC), bilateral parietal cortex, and left fusiform gyrus
   during cognitive reappraisal. The subgroup analysis, jackknife
   sensitivity analysis, heterogeneity analysis, and Egger's tests further
   confirmed these findings.
   Conclusions: Impaired cognitive reappraisal in anxiety disorder may be
   the consequence of hypo-activation of the prefrontoparietal network,
   consistent with insufficient top-down control. Our findings provide
   robust evidence that functional impairment in prefrontoparietal neuronal
   circuits may have a significant role in the pathogenesis of anxiety
   disorder.}},

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex and prevalent
   neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social and communicative
   deficits, as well as repetitive behaviors and atypical sensitivity to
   sensory stimulation. Alterations in network connectivity are widely
   recognized, but their interplay with social and sensory symptoms remains
   largely unclear. Here, functional magnetic resonance imaging and
   diagnostic and behavioral assessments were used in a cohort of children
   and adolescents with ASD (n = 40) and matched typically developing (TD,
   n = 38) controls to examine the relation between auditory processing,
   interhemispheric and thalamocortical network connectivity, and
   social-behavioral symptom severity. We found that atypical processing of
   sounds was related to social, cognitive, and communicative impairments.
   Additionally, severity of sensory processing deficits and lower verbal
   IQ were related to reduced interhemispheric connectivity of auditory
   cortices in ASD. Increased connectivity between the thalamus and
   auditory cortex in ASD, however, was associated with reduced cognitive
   and behavioral symptomatology, suggesting that thalamocortical
   overconnectivity might reflect a compensatory mechanism in ASD. These
   findings provide novel evidence for links between auditory sensory
   deficits and impairments in social interaction and communication. (C)

Abstract = {{Sensory over-responsivity (SOR) is a common condition in autism spectrum
   disorders (ASD) that is associated with greater social impairment.
   However, the mechanisms through which sensory stimuli may affect social
   functioning are not well understood. This study used fMRI to examine
   brain activity while interpreting communicative intent in 15
   high-functioning youth with ASD and 16 age- and IQ-matched
   typically-developing (TD) controls. Participants completed the task with
   and without a tactile sensory distracter, and with and without
   instructions directing their attention to relevant social cues. When
   completing the task in the presence of the sensory distracter, TD youth
   showed increased activity in auditory language and frontal regions
   whereas ASD youth showed decreased activation in these areas.
   Instructions mitigated this effect such that ASD youth did not decrease
   activation during tactile stimulation; instead, the ASD group showed
   increased medial prefrontal activity. SOR severity modulated the effect
   of the tactile stimulus on social processing. Results demonstrate for
   the first time a neural mechanism through which sensory stimuli cause
   disruption of social cognition, and that attentional modulation can
   restore neural processing of social cues through prefrontal regulation.
   Findings have implications for novel, integrative interventions that
   incorporate attentional directives to target both sensory and social
   symptoms. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Mean and variability in functional brain activations differentially
   predict executive function in older adults: an investigation employing
   functional near-infrared spectroscopy}},
Journal = {{NEUROPHOTONICS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN-MAR}},
Abstract = {{Objective: although the preponderance of research on functional brain
   activity investigates mean group differences, mounting evidence suggests
   that variability in neural activity is beneficial for optimal central
   nervous system (CNS) function. Independent of mean signal estimates,
   recent findings have shown that neural variability diminishes with age
   and is positively associated with cognitive performance, underscoring
   its adaptive nature. The present investigation sought to employ
   functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to derive two
   operationalizations of cerebral oxygenation, representing mean and
   variability {[}using standard deviation (SD)] in neural activity, and to
   specifically contrast these mean-and SD-oxyhemoglobin (HbO) estimates as
   predictors of cognitive function. Method: a total of 25 older adults (71
   to 81 years of age) completed a test of cognitive interference
   (Multisource Interference Task) while undergoing fNIRS recording using a
   multichannel continuous wave optical imaging system (TechEn CW6) over
   bilateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). Time-varying covariation models were
   employed to simultaneously estimate the within-and between-person
   effects of cerebral oxygenation on behavioral performance fluctuations.
   Results: mean effects were predominantly observed at the between-person
   level and suggest that greater concentrations of HbO are associated with
   slower and less accurate performance. Greater HbO variability at the
   between-person level was associated with slower performance, but was
   associated with faster performance at the within-person level.
   Conclusions: these findings are in keeping with assertions that mean and
   variability confer complementary (as opposed to redundant) sources of
   information regarding the effective functioning of a neural system and
   suggest that fNIRS is a viable methodology for capturing meaningful
   variance in the hemodynamic response that is characteristic of adaptive
   CNS function. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative

Title = {{Up-regulation of DMN Connectivity in Mild Cognitive Impairment Via
   Network based Cognitive Training}},
Journal = {{CURRENT ALZHEIMER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{578-589}},
Abstract = {{Background: Previous work designed a network-based protocol of cognitive
   training. This programme exploits a mechanism of induced task-oriented
   co-activation of multiple regions that are part of the default mode
   network (DMN), to induce functional rewiring and increased functional
   connectivity within this network.
   Objective: In this study, the programme was administered to patients
   with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment to test its effects in a
   clinical sample.
   Method: Twenty-three patients with mild cognitive impairment (mean age:
   73.74 years, standard deviation 5.13, female/male ratio 13/10) allocated
   to the experimental condition, underwent one month of computerised
   training, while fourteen patients (mean age: 73.14 years, standard
   deviation 6.16, female/male ratio 7/7) assigned to the control condition
   underwent a regime of intense social engagement. Patients were in the
   prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as confirmed by clinical
   follow ups for at least two years. The DMN was computed at baseline and
   retest, together with other, control patterns of connectivity, grey
   matter maps and neuropsychological profiles.
   Results: A condition-by-timepoint interaction indicating increased
   connectivity triggered by the programme was found in left parietal DMN
   regions. No decreases as well as no changes in the other networks or
   morphology were found. Although between-condition cognitive changes did
   not reach statistical significance, they correlated positively with
   changes in DMN connectivity in the left parietal region, supporting the
   hypothesis that parietal changes were beneficial.
   Conclusion: This programme of cognitive training up-regulates a pattern
   of connectivity which is pathologically down-regulated in AD. We argue
   that, when cognitive interventions are conceptualised as tools to induce
   co-activation repeatedly, they can lead to clinically relevant
   improvements in brain functioning, and can be of aid in support of
   pharmacological and other interventions in the earliest stages of AD.}},

Title = {{Losing Control in Social Situations: How the Presence of Others Affects
   Neural Processes Related to Sense of Agency}},
Journal = {{ENEURO}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Social contexts substantially influence individual behavior, but little
   is known about how they affect cognitive processes related to voluntary
   action. Previously, it has been shown that social context reduces
   participants' sense of agency over the outcomes of their actions and
   outcome monitoring. In this fMRI study on human volunteers, we
   investigated the neural mechanisms by which social context alters sense
   of agency. Participants made costly actions to stop inflating a balloon
   before it burst. On ``social{''} trials, another player could act in
   their stead, but we analyzed only trials in which the other player
   remained passive. We hypothesized that mentalizing processes during
   social trials would affect decision-making fluency and lead to a
   decreased sense of agency. In line with this hypothesis, we found
   increased activity in the bilateral temporo-parietal junction (TPJ),
   precuneus, and middle frontal gyrus during social trials compared with
   nonsocial trials. Activity in the precuneus was, in turn, negatively
   related to sense of agency at a single-trial level. We further found a
   double dissociation between TPJ and angular gyrus (AG): activity in the
   left AG was not sensitive to social context but was negatively related
   to sense of agency. In contrast, activity in the TPJ was modulated by
   social context but was not sensitive to sense of agency.}},

Title = {{The role of parietal cortex in overimitation: a study with fNIRS}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{214-225}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown right parietal activation in response to
   observing irrational actions. Behavioral studies show that people
   sometimes imitate irrational actions, a phenomenon called overimitation.
   However, limitations on movement in functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) mean that the neural basis of overimitation has not been
   studied. To address this, our study employed a less restrictive
   neuroimaging technique, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).
   Measurements were taken while participants observed either rational or
   irrational movements before performing movements on a computerized
   puzzle task. Observing irrational actions produced greater activation in
   right anterior inferior parietal lobule (aIPL), replicating results from
   the fMRI literature. This is a proof of principle that fNIRS can be used
   as an alternative to fMRI in social cognition experiments, and that
   parietal cortex has a core role in responding to irrational actions.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The Ultimatum Game assesses decision-making involved in

   adults.Results: Age differences were not found on the ToM tasks, and a
   lack of variability in performance prevented analyses of the
   relationships between performance on the Ultimatum Game and ToM.
   However, age differences were found on the Ultimatum Game, with older
   adults accepting more unfair offers. Yet, the two age groups did not
   differ in their appreciation of fairness, as assessed using subjective
   fairness ratings.Conclusions: These findings suggest that older adults

   they know they are unfair, as it is in their self-interest to accept
   small monetary values rather than nothing at all.}},

Title = {{Evaluating methods of correcting for multiple comparisons implemented in
   SPM12 in social neuroscience fMRI studies: an example from moral
   psychology}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{257-267}},
Abstract = {{In fMRI research, the goal of correcting for multiple comparisons is to
   identify areas of activity that reflect true effects, and thus would be
   expected to replicate in future studies. Finding an appropriate balance
   between trying to minimize false positives (Type I error) while not
   being too stringent and omitting true effects (Type II error) can be
   challenging. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of these
   types of errors may differ for different areas of study. In many areas
   of social neuroscience that involve complex processes and considerable
   individual differences, such as the study of moral judgment, effects are
   typically smaller and statistical power weaker, leading to the
   suggestion that less stringent corrections that allow for more
   sensitivity may be beneficial and also result in more false positives.
   Using moral judgment fMRI data, we evaluated four commonly used methods
   for multiple comparison correction implemented in Statistical Parametric
   Mapping 12 by examining which method produced the most precise overlap
   with results from a meta-analysis of relevant studies and with results
   from nonparametric permutation analyses. We found that voxelwise
   thresholding with familywise error correction based on Random Field
   Theory provides a more precise overlap (i.e., without omitting too few
   regions or encompassing too many additional regions) than either
   clusterwise thresholding, Bonferroni correction, or false discovery rate
   correction methods.}},

   negative affective processing}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{277-288}},
Abstract = {{Recent evidence suggests that the effects of meditation practice on
   affective processing and resilience have the potential to induce
   neuroplastic changes within the amygdala. Notably, literature speculates
   that meditation training may reduce amygdala activity during negative
   affective processing. Nonetheless, studies have thus far not verified
   this speculation. In this longitudinal study, participants (N=21, 9 men)
   were trained in awareness-based compassion meditation (ABCM) or matched
   relaxation training. The effects of meditation training on amygdala
   activity were examined during passive viewing of affective and neutral
   stimuli in a non-meditative state. We found that the ABCM group
   exhibited significantly reduced anxiety and right amygdala activity
   during negative emotion processing than the relaxation group.
   Furthermore, ABCM participants who performed more compassion practice
   had stronger right amygdala activity reduction during negative emotion
   processing. The lower right amygdala activity after ABCM training may be
   associated with a general reduction in reactivity and distress. As all
   participants performed the emotion processing task in a non-meditative
   state, it appears likely that the changes in right amygdala activity are
   carried over from the meditation practice into the non-meditative state.
   These findings suggest that the distress-reducing effects of meditation
   practice on affective processing may transfer to ordinary states, which
   have important implications on stress management.}},

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{289-300}},
Abstract = {{Sibling and friend relationships have significant impact on individuals'
   socio-emotional development. Hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON) and
   paraventricular nucleus (PVN) synthesize and secrete neuropeptides,
   including oxytocin, associated with attachment behaviors. Here, using
   fMRI, we investigate the implication of these two hypothalamic nuclei in
   the visual processing of personally known faces. Faces of same-sex
   sibling, best friend, celebrity, and unknown person appear in the middle
   of the screen while participants perform a task requiring a button click
   each time a central white dot turns red. Ratings of familiarity (time
   spent together) and emotionality (feelings toward individual) toward the
   four individuals are recorded. Local activation within the hypothalamus
   is assessed via two complementary methods: (1) voxel-based analyses
   within inclusive mask of the hypothalamus; (2) region-of-interest (ROI)
   analysis of partial hypothalamic volumes using SON and PVN as center of
   mass coordinates, with percent signal change extracted and analyzed
   within these ROIs. Results suggest that the SON responds to all familiar
   individuals while the PVN has increased response to sibling compared to
   friend faces and is correlated to familiarity but not emotionality.
   These findings support differential involvement of local hypothalamic
   substructures SON and PVN in response to faces of individuals with
   different social relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Facial expressions of disgust, which involve movement of the levator
   labii muscles on the nose, allow an organism to restrict the intake of
   potentially aversive stimuli by constricting the air cavities in the
   nostrils and reducing the speed of air intake. In the current research,
   we used fMRI of the thoracic spinal cord to measure neural activity
   related to (1) the contraction of the intercostal muscles that modulate
   the velocity of air intake and (2) the sensory feedback associated with
   this contraction. Thirteen participants completed two spinal fMRI runs
   in which the thoracic segments of the spinal cord were measured. Each
   five-minute 40-second run consisted of three 60-second blocks in which
   participants repeatedly generated a disgusted facial expression or a
   non-emotional expression consisting of repeated stretching of the lips
   (which did not involve the nasal cavity). Forty-second rest blocks were
   interleaved between each expression block. The results demonstrated that
   generating emotional expressions of disgust produces significantly more
   activity than producing non-emotional facial expressions. This activity
   occurred in both ventral (motoric) and dorsal (sensory) regions of the
   upper segments of the thoracic spinal cord and demonstrates a link
   between the generation of facial expressions and embodied emotional
   responses.}},

Title = {{Distinct effects of reminding mortality and physical pain on the

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},

Pages = {{372-383}},
Abstract = {{Behavioral research suggests that reminding both mortality and negative
   affect influences self-related thoughts. Using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI), we tested the hypothesis that reminders of
   mortality and physical pain decrease brain activity underlying
   self-related thoughts. Three groups of adults underwent priming
   procedures during which they answered questions pertaining to mortality,
   physical pain, or leisure time, respectively. Before and after priming,
   participants performed personality trait judgments on oneself or a
   celebrity, identified the font of words, or passively viewed a fixation.
   The default-mode activity and neural activity underlying self-reflection
   were identified by contrasting viewing a fixation vs. font judgment and
   trait judgments on oneself vs. a celebrity, respectively. The analyses
   of the pre-priming functional MRI (fMRI) data identified the
   default-mode activity in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), ventral
   medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), and parahippocampal gyrus, and the
   activity underlying instructed self-reflection in both the ventral and
   dorsal regions of the MPFC. The analyses of the post-priming fMRI data
   revealed that, relative to leisure time priming, reminding mortality
   significantly reduced the default-mode PCC activity, and reminding
   physical pain significantly decreased the dorsal MPFC activity during
   instructed self-reflection. Our findings suggest distinct neural
   underpinnings of the effect of reminding morality and aversive emotion
   on default-mode and instructed self-reflection.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{74-93}},
Abstract = {{Eyewitness testimony has been shown to be unreliable and susceptible to
   false memories. Whether eyewitness memory errors are influenced by the
   victim's group membership (relative to both the eyewitness and
   perpetrator) is underexplored. The current study used complementary
   behavioral and neuroimaging approaches to test the hypothesis that
   intragroup conflict heightens participants' susceptibility to subsequent
   false memories. Healthy young adults witnessed and later answered
   questions about events in which the perpetrator and victim were either
   1) identified as in-group members relative to each other and the
   eyewitness, 2) out-group members relative to the eyewitness, but not
   each other, or 3) out-group members relative to each other (Experiments
   1a and 1b). When perpetrators and victims were in-group members
   (intragroup conflict), participants showed heightened false memory
   rates. Moreover, false memories increased upon crime realization.
   Neuroimaging data analysis revealed that salient (as compared to
   ambiguous) intragroup conflict elicited heightened activation in neural
   regions associated with resolving cognitive conflict (anterior cingulate
   cortex; ACC). Increased functional connectivity between the ACC and
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex was associated with subsequent false
   memories (Experiment 2). Results suggest that the social salience of the
   intragroup conflict may have been associated with participants'
   increased susceptibility to false memories.}},

Pages = {{117-128}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that the amygdala is more involved in
   processing animate categories, such as humans and animals, than
   inanimate objects, but little is known regarding whether this animate
   advantage applies to auditory stimuli. To address this issue, we
   performed a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study with
   emotion and category as factors, in which subjects heard sounds from
   different categories (i.e., humans, animals, and objects) in negative
   and neutral dimensions. Emotional levels and semantic familiarity were
   matched across categories. The results showed that the amygdala
   responded more to human vocalization than to animal vocalization and
   sounds of inanimate objects in both negative and neutral valences, and
   more to animal sounds than to objects in neural condition. In addition,
   the amygdala, together with the insula and the right superior temporal
   sulcus, further distinguished human voices from animal sounds. These
   data indicated that the amygdala is prepared to respond to animate
   sources, especially human vocalizations in auditory modality.}},

Abstract = {{Psychobehavioral intervention is an effective treatment of Internet
   addiction, including Internet gaming disorder (IGD). However, the neural
   mechanisms underlying its efficacy remain unclear. Cortical-ventral
   striatum (VS) circuitry is a common target of psychobehavioral
   interventions in drug addiction, and cortical-VS dysfunction has been
   reported in IGD; hence, the primary aim of the study was to investigate
   how the VS circuitry responds to psychobehavioral interventions in IGD.
   In a cross-sectional study, we examined resting-state functional
   connectivity of the VS in 74 IGD subjects (IGDs) and 41 healthy controls
   (HCs). In a follow-up craving behavioral intervention (CBI) study, of
   the 74 IGD subjects, 20 IGD subjects received CBI (CBI+) and 16 IGD
   subjects did not (CBI-). All participants were scanned twice with
   similar time interval to assess the effects of CBI. IGD subjects showed
   greater resting-state functional connectivity of the VS to left inferior
   parietal lobule (lIPL), right inferior frontal gyrus and left middle
   frontal gyrus, in positive association with the severity of IGD.
   Moreover, compared with CBI-, CBI+ showed significantly greater decrease
   in VS-lIPL connectivity, along with amelioration in addiction severity
   following the intervention. These findings demonstrated that functional
   connectivity between VS and lIPL, each presumably mediating gaming
   craving and attentional bias, may be a potential biomarker of the
   efficacy of psychobehavioral intervention. These results also suggested
   that non-invasive techniques such as transcranial magnetic or direct
   current stimulation targeting the VS-IPL circuitry may be used in the
   treatment of Internet gaming disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We explored the effects of playing the piano on patients with
   cognitive impairment after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and,
   addressed the question if this approach would stimulate neural networks
   in re-routing neural connections and link up cortical circuits that had
   been functional inhibited due to disruption of brain tissue. Functional
   neuroimaging scans (fMRI) and neuropsychological tests were performed
   pre-post intervention. Method: Three groups participated, one mTBI group
   (n=7), two groups of healthy participants, one with music training
   (n=11), one baseline group without music (n=12). The music groups
   participated in 8weeks music-supported intervention. Results: The
   patient group revealed training-related neuroplasticity in the
   orbitofrontal cortex. fMRI results fit well with outcome from
   neuropsychological tests with significant enhancement of cognitive
   performance in the music groups. Ninety per cent of mTBI group returned
   to work post intervention. Conclusion: Here, for the first time, we
   demonstrated behavioural improvements and functional brain changes after
   8weeks of playing piano on patients with mTBI having attention, memory
   and social interaction problems. We present evidence for a causal
   relationship between musical training and reorganisation of neural
   networks promoting enhanced cognitive performance. These results add a
   novel music-supported intervention within rehabilitation of patients
   with cognitive deficits following mTBI.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{17}},
Pages = {{16-23}},
Abstract = {{The goal of the present study was to apply deep learning algorithms to
   identify autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients from large brain
   imaging dataset, based solely on the patients brain activation patterns.
   We investigated ASD patients brain imaging data from a world-wide
   multi-site database known as ABIDE (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange).
   ASD is a brain-based disorder characterized by social deficits and
   repetitive behaviors. According to recent Centers for Disease Control
   data, ASD affects one in 68 children in the United States. We
   investigated patterns of functional connectivity that objectively
   identify ASD participants from functional brain imaging data, and
   attempted to unveil the neural patterns that emerged from the
   classification. The results improved the state-of-the-art by achieving
   70\% accuracy in identification of ASD versus control patients in the
   dataset. The patterns that emerged from the classification show an
   anticorrelation of brain function between anterior and posterior areas
   of the brain; the anticorrelation corroborates current empirical
   evidence of anteriorposterior disruption in brain connectivity in ASD.
   We present the results and identify the areas of the brain that
   contributed most to differentiating ASD from typically developing
   controls as per our deep learning model.}},

Abstract = {{Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) affect the development of social
   cognition (and identify a risk factor for several physical and mental
   disorders). Theory of Mind (ToM) is a key predictor of social
   functioning, mental health, and quality of life. No previous study
   explored the effect of mild ACEs on the neural correlates of ToM in
   healthy humans. In 23 healthy participants, we used brain blood oxygen
   level-dependent fMRI to study the effect of ACEs on the neural responses
   to tasks targeting affective and cognitive ToM. Results pointed out an
   association between ACEs and a lower neural response in the vermis of
   the cerebellum (r=-.85), precentral gyrus, and inferior frontal
   operculum (putative Mirror Neural System, r=-.78) during affective ToM.
   A lower recruitment of these brain regions, paralleled by the same
   performance, could express an increased neural efficacy in inferring
   affective mental states driven by previous experience, in this case,
   ACEs.}},

Journal = {{EBIOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{27}},
Pages = {{86-93}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: The delineation of the behavioral neurobiological mechanisms
   underlying the heterogeneous pathways for alcohol use disorders (AUDs)
   is ostensibly imperative for the development of more cost-effective
   treatments predicated on better understanding of this complex
   psychopathology.
   Methods: 1) Forty-eight high anxiety sensitive (HAS) and high sensation
   seeking (HSS) psychopathology-free emerging adults (mean (SD) age: 20.4
   (1.9) years) completed a Face Emotion Processing Task and a social
   stress paradigm(Montreal Imaging Stress Task) during functional magnetic
   resonance imaging sessions with and without alcohol ingestion (1 ml/kg
   of 95\% USP alcohol, p.o.). Drug and alcohol use was reassessed during
   follow-up interviews 2-3 years later.
   Outcomes: The effects of alcohol (versus placebo) ingestion depended
   upon the task and risk group. In response to negative (versus neutral)
   faces, alcohol diminished amygdala (AMYG) activations in HAS but not HSS
   subjects. In response to psychosocial evaluative stress, alcohol
   enhanced activations of the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC),
   perigenual anterior cingulate cortex, and nucleus accumbens in HAS male
   subjects (HASMS), but decreased mOFC activity in HSS male subjects
   (HSSMS). At follow-up, a greater alcohol versus placebo differential for
   threat-related AMYG activations predicted escalating drinking and/or
   illicit drug use among HAS but not HSS participants, whereas a greater
   differential for mOFC activations during acute social stress predicted
   escalating substance use among HSS but not HAS participants.
   Interpretation: This double dissociation provides evidence of distinct
   neurobiological profiles in a priori identified personality trait-based
   risk groups for AUDs, and links these signatures to clinically relevant
   substance use outcomes at follow-up. AUD subtypes might benefit from
   motivationally and personality-specific ameliorative and preventative
   interventions. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is

Abstract = {{Depression during pregnancy is highly prevalent and has a multitude of
   potential risks of the offspring. Among confirmed consequences is a
   higher risk of psychopathology. However, it is unknown how maternal
   depression may impact the child's brain to mediate this vulnerability.
   Here we studied amygdala functioning, using task-based functional MRI,
   in children aged 6-9 years as a function of prenatal maternal depressive
   symptoms selected from a prospective population-based sample (The
   Generation R Study). We show that children exposed to clinically
   relevant maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy (N = 19) have
   increased amygdala responses to negative emotional faces compared to
   control children (N = 20) {[}F(1,36) 7.02, p = 0.022]. Strikingly,
   postnatal maternal depressive symptoms, obtained at 3 years after birth,
   did not explain this relation. Our findings are in line with a model in
   which prenatal depressive symptoms of the mother are associated with
   amygdala hyperresponsivity in her offspring, which may represent a risk
   factor for later-life psychopathology.}},

   in explicit processing}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{199-206}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{As N270 has been widely shown to be sensitive to nonsocial information
   conflict, the present study investigated whether social information
   conflict can elicit increased N270 in either explicit or implicit
   processing conditions. Gender stereotype-related picture-word pairs and
   picture-word pairs in specific colors were used as social and nonsocial
   information, respectively. Participants performed an explicit task based
   on the S1-S2 paradigm in Study 1, and both social and nonsocial
   information conditions elicited larger N270 than the no-conflict
   condition. In Study 2, participants performed a word judgment task that
   was modified from the S1-S2 paradigm of Study 1. However, neither social
   information nor nonsocial information elicited larger N270 within the
   conflict condition. Social trials generally elicited a more negative ERP
   waveform than nonsocial trials overall. These findings suggest that N270
   may reflect the processing of social information conflict only in
   explicit conditions and also that the cognitive basis of N270 is thus a
   general but explicit processing of working memory representation
   conflict. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Chinese calligraphy handwriting (CCH): a case of rehabilitative
   awakening of a coma patient after stroke}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISEASE AND TREATMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{14}},
Pages = {{407-417}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: This study investigated the efficacy of Chinese
   calligraphy handwriting (CCH) for the awakening of patients under a
   vegetative state after stroke. The theories, the instrument, and the
   treatment protocols were reported. A single case of a severe stroke
   patient who was in a coma state for 2 years is presented in this study.
   The objectives were to apply finger writing as a new method to awaken a
   stroke patient in a coma state and to test the effect of this method in
   improving the patient's vegetative states over time.
   Case presentation: A 55-year-old man suffered a severe stroke in 2004
   which left him in a coma for 2 years without any systematic
   rehabilitation. A culture-based finger-writing method of visual-spatial
   intervention was then applied to improve his condition. The writing
   tasks involved aided viewing and finger tracing of sets of innovative
   characters with enriched visual-spatial and movement characteristics.
   Following regular treatment protocols involving diverse movement and
   sensory feedback, the patient was awakened after 12 months. As a
   consequence, the patient showed significant behavioral changes favoring
   enhanced focusing, alertness, visual scan, visual span, and quickened
   visual and motor responses. The treatment continued for another 12
   months. As the treatment progressed, we gradually observed improvements
   in his attention span and mental concentration. His eye ball
   movements-the left eye in particular were quickened and showed wider
   visual angularity in his focal vision. Currently, the patient can now
   watch television, engage in improved visual sighting, and focus on
   visual-spatial and cognitive-linguistic materials.
   Conclusion: This CCH method of training by finger tracking has shown its
   effectiveness in awakening the patient from his coma state and in
   producing long-term, clinical outcomes that were similar from those that
   took place 10 years ago. This finding supports the efficacy of the
   system for clinical improvement of the patient's conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Increased emphasis on mechanisms of treatment effectiveness, biomarker
   predictors, and objective indicators of treatment response has sparked
   interest in integrated, translational treatment outcomes trials. The
   PROlonGed ExpoSure and Sertraline Trial (PROGrESS) is one such
   randomized controlled trial (RCT) focused on a key question in clinical
   management of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) - the comparative and
   combined effectiveness of medication and psychotherapy. PROGrESS employs
   a state of the art trial design to examine psychotherapy and medication
   effects across three conditions: 1) Prolonged Exposure (PE) plus pill
   placebo, 2) Sertraline (SERT) plus Enhanced Medication Management (EMM),
   and 3) Combined treatment (PE/SERT). Innovative measures will capture
   potential biomarker predictors and indicators of treatment response
   within and across these three treatment conditions in Operation Enduring
   Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND) service
   members and veterans with PTSD. Assessments include clinician-rated
   measures, self-report outcome measures, saliva for salivary cortisol and
   cortisol response to awakening at six assessment points, blood at
   baseline and week 24 for genetic and genomic analysis, as well as
   resting state connectivity and emotion processing and regulation using
   functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) paradigms in a subsample of
   veterans. Accordingly, the current study is designed to provide
   pragmatic clinical direction for the delivery of PTSD treatment through
   its primary outcomes in an effectiveness design, and will also provide
   informative results to elucidate underlying mechanisms and biomarkers
   involved in PTSD treatment response.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Falls represent a major concern for older adults and may
   serve as clinically salient index events for those presenting in the
   prodromal stages of mild cognitive impairment. Declines in executive
   function performance and in gait consistency have shown promise in
   predicting fall risk; however, associated neurophysiological
   underpinnings have received less attention. In this study, we used a
   multimodal approach to assess fall risk in a group of older adults with
   and without a previous fall history.Method: Processing speed, inductive
   reasoning, verbal fluency, crystallized ability, episodic memory, and
   executive functioning were assessed using standardized
   neuropsychological tests. Cognitive interference was assessed using the
   Multi-Source Interference Task. Spatiotemporal gait parameters were
   assessed with and without cognitive load using a 6.4-m instrumented
   walkway. Hemodynamic responses were measured using functional
   near-infrared spectroscopy.Results: Whereas no group differences were
   observed in cognitive behavioral performance, during a cognitive
   interference task fallers displayed more oxygenated hemoglobin across
   the prefrontal cortex than nonfallers, suggesting that engaging in the
   cognitive task was more effortful for them overall, therefore eliciting
   greater cortical activation. Between-group differences in spatial as
   well as temporal gait parameters were also observed.Conclusions: These
   results are in keeping with assertions that diminished executive control
   is related to fall risk. Notably, the group differences observed in
   prefrontal cortical activation and in gait parameters may ultimately
   precede those observed in cognitive behavioral performance, with
   implications for measurement sensitivity and early identification.}},

Abstract = {{Emotional experience involves an integrated interplay between processing
   of external emotional cues and interoceptive feedback, and this is
   impaired in a number of emotional disorders. The neuropeptide oxytocin
   (OT) enhances the salience of external social cues but its influence on
   interoception is unknown. The present pharmaco-fMRI study therefore
   investigated whether OT enhances interoceptive awareness and if it
   influences the interplay between interoceptive and salience processing.
   In a randomized, double-blind, between-subject, design study 83 subjects
   received either intranasal OT or placebo. In Experiment 1, subjects
   performed a heartbeat detection task alone, while in Experiment 2 they
   did so while viewing both neutral and emotional face stimuli.
   Interoceptive accuracy and neural responses in interoceptive and
   salience networks were measured. In Experiment 1, OT had no significant
   influence on interoceptive accuracy or associated activity in the right
   anterior insula (AI) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. However, in
   Experiment 2 when face stimuli were also presented, OT decreased
   interoceptive accuracy and increased right AI activation and its
   functional connectivity with the left posterior insula (PI), with the
   latter both being negatively correlated with accuracy scores. The
   present study provides the first evidence that while OT does not
   influence processing of interoceptive cues per se it may switch
   attention away from them towards external salient social cues by
   enhancing right AI responses and its control over the PI. Thus OT may
   help regulate the interplay between interoceptive and external salience
   processing within the insula and could be of potential therapeutic
   benefit for emotional disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Objective The dominant model of cognitive impairment in focal epilepsy
   has emphasised structural bases for cognitive deficits. Current theories
   of cognition in the healthy brain emphasise the importance of the
   reweighting of brain network interactions in support of task
   performance. Here, we explore the hypothesis that cognitive deficits in
   epilepsy arise through abnormalities of dynamic functional network
   interactions. Method We studied 19 healthy controls and 37 temporal lobe
   epilepsy (TLE) patients, using a behavioural measure of verbal fluency
   (the Controlled Oral Word Association Test) and an fMRI verbal fluency
   paradigm (Orthographic Lexical Retrieval). Results Behaviourally, verbal
   fluency was significantly impaired in TLE. Psychophysiological
   interaction analyses of the fMRI data, which capture state-dependent
   changes in network connectivity, revealed reduced task-dependent
   modulations of connectivity from left superior medial frontal cortex to
   left middle frontal gyrus in TLE patients. Individual differences in
   verbal fluency among TLE cases was correlated with task-dependent
   changes in connectivity from left posterior cingulate to left superior
   medial frontal cortex, and from left superior medial frontal cortex to a
   range of right predominant brain areas. Interpretation These data reveal
   that the typical pattern of task-driven shifts in network connectivity
   is not observed in TLE. Our observations go beyond simple
   structure-function associations and suggest that failure of network
   flexibility can be an important contributor to cognitive impairment in
   epilepsy.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile social media often feature the ability to Like content posted by

   undergoing functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Participants
   more often Liked photographs that appeared to have received many (vs.
   few) Likes. Popular photographs elicited greater activity in multiple
   brain regions, including the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), a hub of the
   brain's reward circuitry. NAcc responsivity increased with age for high
   school but not college students. When viewing images depicting
   risk-taking (vs. nonrisky photographs), high school students, but not
   college students, showed decreased activation of neural regions

Abstract = {{This meta-analysis compares the brain structures and mechanisms involved
   in facial and vocal emotion recognition. Neuroimaging studies
   contrasting emotional with neutral (face: N = 76, voice: N = 34) and
   explicit with implicit emotion processing (face: N = 27, voice: N = 20)
   were collected to shed light on stimulus and goal-driven mechanisms,
   respectively. Activation likelihood estimations were conducted on the
   full data sets for the separate modalities and on reduced,
   modality-matched data sets for modality comparison. Stimulus-driven
   emotion processing engaged large networks with significant modality
   differences in the superior temporal (voice-specific) and the medial
   temporal (face-specific) cortex. Goal-driven processing was associated
   with only a small cluster in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex for
   voices but not faces. Neither stimulus- nor goal-driven processing
   showed significant modality overlap. Together, these findings suggest
   that stimulus-driven processes shape activity in the social brain more
   powerfully than goal-driven processes in both the visual and the
   auditory domains. Yet, whereas faces emphasize subcortical emotional and
   mnemonic mechanisms, voices emphasize cortical mechanisms associated
   with perception and effortful stimulus evaluation (e.g. via
   subvocalization). These differences may be due to sensory stimulus
   properties and highlight the need for a modality-specific perspective
   when modeling emotion processing in the brain.}},

Abstract = {{Those who are high in external motivation to respond without prejudice
   (EMS) tend to focus on non-racial attributes when describing others.
   This fMRI study examined the neural processing of race and an
   alternative yet stereotypically relevant attribute (viz., socioeconomic
   status: SES) as a function of the perceiver's EMS. Sixty-one White
   participants privately formed impressions of Black and White faces
   ascribed with high or low SES. Analyses focused on regions supporting
   race- and status-based reward/salience (NAcc), evaluation (VMPFC) and
   threat/relevance (amygdala). Consistent with previous findings from the
   literature on status-based evaluation, we observed greater neural
   responses to high-status (vs low-status) targets in all regions of
   interest when participants were relatively low in EMS. In contrast, we
   observed the opposite pattern when participants were relatively high in
   EMS. Notably, all effects were independent of target race. In summary,
   White perceivers' race-related motivations similarly altered their
   neural responses to the SES of Black and White targets. Specifically,
   the findings suggest that EMS may attenuate the positive value and/or
   salience of high status in a mixed-race context. Findings are discussed
   in the context of the stereotypic relationship between race and SES.}},

Abstract = {{The neural underpinnings of repetitive behaviors (RBs) in autism
   spectrum disorders (ASDs), ranging from cognitive to motor
   characteristics, remain unknown. We assessed RB symptomatology in 50 ASD
   and 52 typically developing (TD) children and adolescents (ages 8-17
   years), examining intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) of
   corticostriatal circuitry, which is important for reward-based learning
   and integration of emotional, cognitive and motor processing, and
   considered impaired in ASDs. Connectivity analyses were performed for
   three functionally distinct striatal seeds (limbic, frontoparietal and
   motor). Functional connectivity with cortical regions of interest was
   assessed for corticostriatal circuit connectivity indices and ratios,
   testing the balance of connectivity between circuits. Results showed
   corticostriatal overconnectivity of limbic and frontoparietal seeds, but
   underconnectivity of motor seeds. Correlations with RBs were found for
   connectivity between the striatal motor seeds and cortical motor
   clusters from the whole-brain analysis, and for frontoparietal/limbic
   and motor/limbic connectivity ratios. Division of ASD participants into
   high (n = 17) and low RB subgroups (n = 19) showed reduced
   frontoparietal/limbic and motor/limbic circuit ratios for high RB
   compared to low RB and TD groups in the right hemisphere. Results
   suggest an association between RBs and an imbalance of corticostriatal
   iFC in ASD, being increased for limbic, but reduced for frontoparietal
   and motor circuits.}},

Abstract = {{Political conservatism is associated with an increased negativity bias,
   including increased attention and reactivity toward negative and
   threatening stimuli. Although the human amygdala has been implicated in
   the response to threatening stimuli, no studies to date have
   investigated whether conservatism is associated with altered amygdala
   function toward threat. Furthermore, although an influential theory
   posits that connectivity between the amygdala and bed nucleus of the
   stria terminalis (BNST) is important in initiating the response to
   sustained or uncertain threat, whether individual differences in
   conservatism modulate this connectivity is unknown. To test whether
   conservatism is associated with increased reactivity in neural threat
   circuitry, we measured participants' self-reported social and economic
   conservatism and asked them to complete high-resolution fMRI scans while
   under threat of an unpredictable shock and while safe. We found that
   economic conservatism predicted greater connectivity between the BNST
   and a cluster of voxels in the left amygdala during threat vs safety.
   These results suggest that increased amygdala-BNST connectivity during
   threat may be a key neural correlate of the enhanced negativity bias
   found in conservatism.}},

Abstract = {{HIV is most prevalent among men who have sex with men (MSM), and

   examined neural correlates of playing a virtual sexual `hook up' game in
   an functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner in MSM who had, in the
   past 90 days, been sexually risky (N = 76) or safe (N = 31). We found
   that during potentially risky sexual choices, previously risky MSM had
   more right insula activity than previously safe MSM. Real-life sexual
   risk was related to trait positive and negative urgency. Insula activity
   that differentiated risky and safe MSM was related to trait positive and
   negative urgency. Future work should further examine if, and to what
   extent, insula activation during safe sex negotiation drives MSM's rash
   risky sexual decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{The superior temporal sulcus (STS) is a major component of the human
   face perception network, implicated in processing dynamic changeable
   aspects of faces. However, it remains unknown whether STS holds
   functionally segregated subdivisions for different categories of facial
   movements. We used high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) at 7T in 16 volunteers to compare STS activation with faces
   displaying angry or happy expressions, eye-gaze shifts and lip-speech
   movements. Combining univariate and multivariate analyses, we show a
   systematic topological organization within STS, with gaze-related
   activity predominating in the most posterior and superior sector,
   speech-related activity in the anterior sector and emotional expressions
   represented in the intermediate middle STS. Right STS appeared to hold a
   finer functional segregation between all four types of facial movements,
   and best discriminative abilities within the face-selective posterior
   STS (pSTS). Conversely, left STS showed greater overlap between
   conditions, with a lack of distinction between mouth movements
   associated to speech or happy expression and better discriminative
   abilities (for gaze and speech vs emotion conditions) outside pSTS.
   Differential sensitivity to upper (eye) or lower (mouth) facial features
   may contribute to, but does not appear to fully account for, these
   response patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Maltreatment is associated with increased risk of a range of psychiatric
   disorders, many of which are characterized by altered risk-taking
   propensity. Currently, little is known about the neural correlates of
   risk-taking in children exposed to maltreatment, nor whether their
   risk-taking is atypically modulated by peer influence. Seventy-five 10-
   to 14-year-old children {[}maltreated (MT) group: N = 41; non-maltreated
   Group (NMT): N = 34] performed a Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART),
   under three different peer influence conditions: while alone, while
   being observed by a peer and while being encouraged by a peer to take
   risks. The MT group engaged in less risk-taking irrespective of peer
   influence. There was no differential effect of peer influence on
   risk-taking behaviour across groups. At the neural level, the right
   anterior insula (rAI) exhibited altered risk sensitivity across
   conditions in the MT group. Across groups and conditions, rAI risk
   sensitivity was negatively associated with risk-taking and within the MT
   group greater rAI risk sensitivity was related to more anxiety symptoms.
   These findings suggest that children with a history of maltreatment show
   reduced risk-taking but typical responses to peer influence. Abnormal
   rAI functioning contributes to the pattern of reduced risk-taking and
   may predispose children exposed to maltreatment to develop future
   psychopathology.}},

Abstract = {{In the natural world, faces are not isolated objects but are rather
   encountered in the context of the whole body. Previous work has studied
   the perception of combined faces and bodies using behavioural and
   electrophysiological measurements, but the neural correlates of
   emotional face-body perception still remain unexplored. Here, we
   combined happy and fearful faces and bodies to investigate the influence
   of body expressions on the neural processing of the face, the effect of
   emotional ambiguity between the two and the role of the amygdala in this
   process. Our functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses showed that
   the activity in motor, prefrontal and visual areas increases when facial
   expressions are presented together with bodies rather than in isolation,
   consistent with the notion that seeing body expressions triggers both
   emotional and action-related processes. In contrast, psychophysiological
   interaction analyses revealed that amygdala modulatory activity
   increases after the presentation of isolated faces when compared to
   combined faces and bodies. Furthermore, a facial expression combined
   with a congruent body enhanced both cortical activity and amygdala
   functional connectivity when compared to an incongruent face-body
   compound. Finally, the results showed that emotional body postures
   influence the processing of facial expressions, especially when the
   emotion conveyed by the body implies danger.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by
   emotion dysregulation; however, it is unclear whether this is restricted
   to negative emotional stimuli or to what degree this is specific to BPD.
   We investigated neural correlates of hypothesized increased emotional
   sensitivity and impaired emotion regulation in patients with BPD.
   Methods: During functional MRI (fMRI) scanning, patients with BPD,
   non-patient controls and patients with cluster-C personality disorder
   completed an emotion regulation task, including negative, positive and
   erotic social pictures. Results: We included 55 patients with BPD, 42
   nonpatient controls and 24 patients with cluster-C personality disorder
   in our analyses. Passive viewing of negative stimuli resulted in greater
   activity in the anterior insula, temporoparietal junction and
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in patients with BPD than in nonpatient
   controls. The increased activity in the anterior insula and
   temporoparietal junction was also present when patients with BPD viewed
   positive stimuli. During regulation of negative stimuli compared with
   passive viewing, nonpatient controls showed greater activity in the
   dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, middle
   temporal gyrus and bilateral inferior parietal lobule. Patients with BPD
   did not show this increase in activity. Limitations: Findings cannot be
   generalized to men, and patients represented a heterogeneous group
   regarding comorbid diagnoses and medication. Conclusion: When looking at
   emotional stimuli, patients with BPD showed a unique pattern of
   activity, suggesting an increase in brain activity involved in emotion
   generation. In the case of negative stimuli this is accompanied by
   increased activity in regulation areas. In contrast, increase of
   regulation processes seems absent when patients with BPD are explicitly
   instructed to regulate. Results of diagnosis specificity support a
   dimensional rather than a dichotomous differentiation between BPD and
   cluster-C personality disorder regarding emotional sensitivity and
   emotional regulation of social stimuli.}},

Journal = {{DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Face recognition abilities improve between adolescence and adulthood
   over typical development (TD), but plateau in autism, leading to
   increasing face recognition deficits in autism later in life.
   Developmental differences between autism and TD may reflect changes
   between neural systems involved in the development of face encoding and
   recognition. Here, we focused on whole-brain connectivity with the
   fusiform face area (FFA), a well-established face-preferential brain
   region. Older children, adolescents, and adults with and without autism
   completed the Cambridge Face Memory Test, and a matched car memory test,
   during fMRI scanning. We then examined task-based functional
   connectivity between the FFA and the rest of the brain, comparing autism
   and TD groups during encoding and recognition of face and car stimuli.
   The autism group exhibited underconnectivity, relative to the TD group,
   between the FFA and frontal and primary visual cortices, independent of
   age. Underconnectivity with the medial and rostral lateral prefrontal
   cortex was face-specific during encoding and recognition, respectively.
   Conversely, underconnectivity with the L orbitofrontal cortex was
   evident for both face and car encoding. Atypical age-related changes in
   connectivity emerged between the FFA and the R temporoparietal junction,
   and R dorsal striatum for face stimuli only. Similar differences in
   age-related changes in autism emerged for FFA connectivity with the
   amygdala across both face and car recognition. Thus, underconnectivity
   and atypical development of functional connectivity may lead to a less
   optimal face-processing network in the context of increasing general and
   social cognitive deficits in autism.}},

   adolescent reward sensitivity during risk taking}},
Journal = {{DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Adolescent decision-making is highly sensitive to input from the social
   environment. In particular, adult and maternal presence influence
   adolescents to make safer decisions when encountered with risky
   scenarios. However, it is currently unknown whether maternal presence
   confers a greater advantage than mere adult presence in buffering
   adolescent risk taking. In the current study, 23 adolescents completed a
   risk-taking task during an fMRI scan in the presence of their mother and
   an unknown adult. Results reveal that maternal presence elicits greater
   activation in reward-related neural circuits when making safe decisions
   but decreased activation following risky choices. Moreover, adolescents
   evidenced a more immature neural phenotype when making risky choices in
   the presence of an adult compared to mother, as evidenced by positive
   functional coupling between the ventral striatum and medial prefrontal
   cortex. Our results underscore the importance of maternal stimuli in
   bolstering adolescent decision-making in risky scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{The growth of online shopping increases consumers' dependence on
   vicarious sensory experiences, such as observing others touching
   products in commercials. However, empirical evidence on whether
   observing others' sensory experiences increases purchasing intention is
   still scarce. In the present study, participants observed others
   interacting with products in the first- or third-person perspective in
   video clips, and their neural responses were measured with functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We investigated (1) whether and how
   vicariously touching certain products affected purchasing intention, and
   the neural correlates of this process; and (2) how visual perspective
   interacts with vicarious tactility. Vicarious tactile experiences were
   manipulated by hand actions touching or not touching the products, while
   the visual perspective was manipulated by showing the hand actions
   either in first- or third-person perspective. During the fMRI scanning,
   participants watched the video clips and rated their purchasing
   intention for each product. The results showed that, observing others
   touching (vs. not touching) the products increased purchasing intention,
   with vicarious neural responses found in mirror neuron systems (MNS) and
   lateral occipital complex (LOC). Moreover, the stronger neural
   activities in MNS was associated with higher purchasing intention. The
   effects of visual perspectives were found in left superior parietal
   lobule (SPL), while the interaction of tactility and visual perspective
   was shown in precuneus and precuneus-LOC connectivity. The present study
   provides the first evidence that vicariously touching a given product
   increased purchasing intention and the neural activities in bilateral
   MNS, LOC, left SPL and precuneus are involved in this process. Hum Brain

Abstract = {{The investigation of neurocognitive processes underlying more real-life
   creative behavior is among the greatest challenges in creativity
   research. In this fMRI study, we addressed this issue by investigating
   functional patterns of brain activity while participants were required
   to be creative in an affective context. Affective creativity was
   assessed in terms of individual's inventiveness in generating
   alternative appraisals for anger-evoking events, which has recently
   emerged as a new ability concept in cognitive reappraisal research. In
   addition, a classic divergent thinking task was administered. Both
   creativity tasks yielded strong activation in left prefrontal regions,
   indicating their shared cognitive processing demands like the inhibition
   of prepotent responses, shifting between different perspectives and
   controlled memory retrieval. Regarding task-specific differences,
   classic creative ideation activated a characteristic divergent thinking
   network comprising the left supramarginal, inferior temporal, and
   inferior frontal gyri. Affective creativity on the other hand
   specifically recruited the right superior frontal gyrus, presumably
   involved in the postretrieval monitoring of reappraisal success, and
   core hubs of the default-mode network, which are also implicated in
   social cognition. As a whole, by taking creativity research to the realm
   of emotion, this study advances our understanding of how more real-life
   creativity is rooted in the brain. Hum Brain Mapp 39:393-406, 2018. (c)

Abstract = {{Genetics and neuroscience are two areas of science that pose particular
   methodological problems because they involve detecting weak signals
   (i.e., small effects) in noisy data. In recent years, increasing numbers
   of studies have attempted to bridge these disciplines by looking for
   genetic factors associated with individual differences in behavior,
   cognition, and brain structure or function. However, different
   methodological approaches to guarding against false positives have
   evolved in the two disciplines. To explore methodological issues
   affecting neurogenetic studies, we conducted an in-depth analysis of 30
   consecutive articles in 12 top neuroscience journals that reported on
   genetic associations in nonclinical human samples. It was often
   difficult to estimate effect sizes in neuroimaging paradigms. Where
   effect sizes could be calculated, the studies reporting the largest
   effect sizes tended to have two features: (i) they had the smallest
   samples and were generally underpowered to detect genetic effects, and
   (ii) they did not fully correct for multiple comparisons. Furthermore,
   only a minority of studies used statistical methods for multiple
   comparisons that took into account correlations between phenotypes or
   genotypes, and only nine studies included a replication sample or
   explicitly set out to replicate a prior finding. Finally, presentation
   of methodological information was not standardized and was often
   distributed across Methods sections and Supplementary Material, making
   it challenging to assemble basic information from many studies. Space
   limits imposed by journals could mean that highly complex statistical
   methods were described in only a superficial fashion. In summary,
   methods that have become standard in the genetics literaturestringent
   statistical standards, use of large samples, and replication of
   findingsare not always adopted when behavioral, cognitive, or
   neuroimaging phenotypes are used, leading to an increased risk of
   false-positive findings. Studies need to correct not just for the number
   of phenotypes collected but also for the number of genotypes examined,
   genetic models tested, and subsamples investigated. The field would
   benefit from more widespread use of methods that take into account
   correlations between the factors corrected for, such as spectral
   decomposition, or permutation approaches. Replication should become
   standard practice; this, together with the need for larger sample sizes,
   will entail greater emphasis on collaboration between research groups.
   We conclude with some specific suggestions for standardized reporting in
   this area.}},

   experiment in WOZ environment in which different subjects (n=17)
   interacting with the same robot while they believe that the robot is a
   different robot, up to three versions. Each robot scenario provides a
   different `humanoid' description, and out hypothesis is that the more
   human-like looks the robot, the more empathically can be the human
   responses. Results were obtained from questionnaires and multi-angle
   video recordings. Positive results reinforce the strength of our
   hypothesis, although we recommend a new and bigger and then more robust
   experiment.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been demonstrated to be
   an effective treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the
   neuroanatomical basis of response to ECT is still largely unknown.
   Methods: In present study, we used functional connectivity density (FCD)
   and resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) to identify the
   relationship between the changes of resting-state activities and ECT
   responses in 23 MDD patients before and after ECT. In addition, the
   identified neural indices as classification characteristics were entered
   into multivariate pattern analysis using linear support vector machine
   (SVM) to classify 23 MDD patients before ECT from 25 gender, age and
   years of education matched healthy controls.
   Results: We found that the changes of local FCD (lFCD), not long-range
   FCD, of the left pre-/postcentral gyrus (Pre-/postCG), left superior
   temporal gyrus (STG), and right STG were significantly correlated with
   the changes of Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) scores in MDD
   patients before and after ECT. The subsequent functional connectivity
   analysis revealed significantly decreased functional connectivity
   between right STG and right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) in MDD after ECT
   in spite of no correlation with HRSD scores. Finally, SVM-based
   classification achieved an accuracy of 72.92\% with a sensitivity of
   73.91\% and a specificity of 72\% by leave-one-out cross-validation.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicated that Pre-/postCG and bilateral STG
   play an important role in response of ECT in MDD patients, and the lFCD
   in these areas may serve as a biomarker for predicting ECT response.}},

Abstract = {{Schizophrenia is a complex disorder in which abnormalities in brain
   connectivity and social functioning play a central role. The aim of this
   study is to explore small-world network properties, and understand their
   relationship with social functioning and social cognition in the context
   of schizophrenia, by testing functional connectivity differences in
   network properties and its relation to clinical behavioral measures.
   Resting-state fMRI time series data were acquired from 23 patients
   diagnosed with schizophrenia and 23 healthy volunteers. The results
   revealed that patients with schizophrenia show significantly decreased
   connectivity between a range of brain regions, particularly involving
   connections among the right orbitofrontal cortex, bilateral putamen and
   left amygdala. Furthermore, topological properties of functional brain
   networks in patients with schizophrenia were characterized by reduced
   path length compared to healthy controls; however, no significant
   difference was found for clustering coefficient, local efficiency or
   global efficiency. Additionally, we found that nodal efficiency of the
   amygdala and the putamen were significantly correlated with the
   independence-performance subscale of social functioning scale (SFC), and
   Reading the Mind in the Eyes test; however, the correlations do not
   survive correction for multiple comparison. The current results help to
   clarify the relationship between social functioning deficits and
   topological brain measures in schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{Anhedonia is an important feature of major depression and
   schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Few neuroimaging studies have
   investigated neural alterations in high anhedonia, isolated from other
   psychopathological variables, by including only participants without
   clinical diagnoses. The present study examined healthy individuals
   scoring high (AT =18) vs. low (N = 19) in social anhedonia, who were
   carefully selected from a sample of N = 282 participants. To examine
   differences in automatic brain responses to social-affective stimuli
   between high vs. low social anhedonia participants, we used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging. To assess early, automatic stages of emotion
   processing, we administered a paradigm presenting brief (33 ms),
   backward-masked happy, sad, and neutral facial expressions. Individuals
   high in social anhedonia demonstrated increased activation in the
   bilateral thalamus and left red nucleus in response to masked sad faces
   relative to individuals low in social anhedonia. No significant group
   differences in brain activation emerged in other regions known to be
   involved in emotion and reward processing, including the amygdala and
   nucleus accumbens. Our results suggest that high social anhedonia in
   otherwise healthy individuals is associated with exaggerated automatic
   reactivity in the thalamus, which is a brain structure that has been
   implicated in the mediation of attentional processes.}},

Title = {{Role of Spontaneous Brain Activity in Explicit and Implicit Aspects of

   Resting-state fMRI Study using Fractional Amplitude of Low-frequency
   Fluctuations}},
Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{367}},

Month = {{DEC 26}},
Abstract = {{We are constantly exposed to socially conflicting situations in everyday
   life, and cognitive flexibility is essential for adaptively coping with
   such difficulties. Flexible goal choice and pursuit are not exclusively
   conscious, and therefore cognitive flexibility involves both explicit
   and implicit forms of processing. However, it is unclear how individual
   differences in explicit and implicit aspects of flexibility are
   associated with neural activity in a resting state. Here, we measured
   intrinsic fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) by
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) as an
   indicator of regional brain spontaneous activity, together with explicit
   and implicit aspects of cognitive flexibility using the Cognitive
   Flexibility Scale (CFS) and Implicit Association Test (IAT). Consistent
   with the dual processing theory, there was a strong association between
   explicit aspects of flexibility (CFS score) and ``rationalism{''}
   thinking style and between implicit aspects (IAT effect) and
   ``experientialism.{''} The level of explicit flexibility was also
   correlated with fALFF values in the left lateral prefrontal cortex,
   whereas the level of implicit flexibility was correlated with fALFF
   values in the right cerebellum. Furthermore, the fALFF values in both
   regions predicted individual preference for flexible decision-making
   strategy in a vignettes simulation task. These results add to our
   understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying flexible
   decision-making for solving social conflicts. More generally, our
   findings highlight the utility of RS-fMRI combined with both explicit
   and implicit psychometric measures for better understanding individual
   differences in social cognition. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by

Abstract = {{Uncontrolled anger may lead to aggression and is common in various
   clinical conditions, including post traumatic stress disorder. Emotion
   regulation strategies may vary with some more adaptive and efficient
   than others in reducing angry feelings. However, such feelings tend to
   linger after anger provocation, extending the challenge of coping with
   anger beyond provocation. Task-independent resting-state (rs) fMRI may
   be a particularly useful paradigm to reveal neural processes of
   spontaneous recovery from a preceding negative emotional experience. We
   aimed to trace the carryover effects of anger on endogenous neural
   dynamics by applying a data-driven examination of changes in functional
   connectivity (FC) during rs-fMRI between before and after an
   interpersonal anger induction (N = 44 men). Anger was induced based on
   unfair monetary offers in a previously validated decision-making task.
   We calculated a common measure of global FC (gFC) which captures the
   level of FC between each region and all other regions in the brain, and
   examined which brain regions manifested changes in this measure
   following anger. We next examined the changes in all functional
   connections of each individuated brain region with all other brain
   regions to reveal which connections underlie the differences found in
   the gFC analysis of the previous step. We subsequently examined the
   relation of the identified neural modulations in the aftermath of anger
   with state-and trait-like measures associated with anger, including
   brain structure, and in a subsample of designated infantry soldiers (N =
   21), with levels of traumatic stress symptoms (TSS) measured 1 year
   later following combat-training. The analysis pipeline revealed an
   increase in right amygdala gFC in the aftermath of anger and
   specifically with the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). We found that
   the increase in FC between the right amygdala and right IFG following
   anger was positively associated with smaller right IFG volume, higher
   trait-anger level and among soldiers with more TSS. Moreover, higher
   levels of right amygdala gFC at baseline predicted less reported anger
   during the subsequent anger provocation. The results suggest that
   increased amygdala-IFG connectivity following anger is associated with
   maladaptive recovery, and relates to long-term development of stress
   symptomatology in a subsample of soldiers.}},

   young adults, at which time we reassessed their life circumstances,
   acquired fMRI data during a reward-processing task, and tested their
   judgment and decision making. Individuals who experienced high levels of
   early life stress showed lower levels of brain activation when
   processing cues signaling potential loss and increased responsivity when
   actually experiencing losses. Specifically, those with high childhood
   stress had reduced activation in the posterior cingulate/precuneus,
   middle temporal gyrus, and superior occipital cortex during the
   anticipation of potential rewards; reduced activation in putamen and
   insula during the anticipation of potential losses; and increased left
   inferior frontal gyrus activation when experiencing an actual loss.
   These patterns of brain activity were associated with both laboratory
   and real-world measures of individuals' risk taking in adulthood.
   Importantly, these effects were predicated only by childhood stress
   exposure and not by current levels of life stress.}},

Abstract = {{Happiness is regarded as one of the most fundamental human goals. Given
   recent reports that positive feelings are contagious (e.g., the presence
   of a happy person enhances others' happiness) because of the human
   ability to empathize (i.e., sharing emotions), empathic ability may be a
   key factor in increasing one's own subjective level of happiness. Based
   on previous studies indicating that a single nucleotide polymorphism in
   the serotonin 2A receptor gene {[}HTR2A rs6311 guanine (G) vs. adenine
   (A)] is associated with sensitivity to emotional stimuli and several
   mental disorders such as depression, we predicted that the polymorphism
   might be associated with the effect of sharing happiness. To elucidate
   the neural and genetic correlates of the effect of sharing happiness, we
   first performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a
   ``happy feelings{''} evocation task (emotional event imagination task),
   during which we manipulated the valence of the imagined event (positive,
   neutral, or negative), as well as the presence of a friend experiencing
   a positive-valence event (presence or absence). We recruited young adult
   women for this fMRI study because empathic ability may be higher in
   women than in men. Participants felt happier (p < 0.01) and the
   mentalizing/ theory-of-mind network, which spans the medial prefrontal
   cortex, temporoparietal junction, temporal poles, and precuneus, was
   significantly more active (p < 0.05) in the presence condition than in
   the absence condition regardless of event valence. Moreover,
   participants with the GG (p < 0.01) and AG (p < 0.05) genotypes of HTR2A
   experienced happier feelings as well as greater activation of a part of
   the mentalizing/ theory-of-mind network (p < 0.05) during empathy for
   happiness (neutral/presence condition) than those with the AA genotype.
   In a follow-up study with a vignette-based questionnaire conducted in a
   relatively large sample, male and female participants were presented
   with the same imagined events wherein their valence and the presence of
   a friend were manipulated. Results showed genetic differences in
   happiness-related empathy regardless of sex (p < 0.05). Findings suggest
   that HTR2A polymorphisms are associated with the effect of sharing
   happiness by modulating the activity of the mentalizing/ theory-of-mind
   network.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Current neuroimaging perspectives on a variety of mental
   disorders emphasize dysfunction of the amygdala. The neuropeptide
   oxytocin (OXT), a key mediator in the regulation of social cognition and
   behavior, accumulates in cerebrospinal fluid after intranasal
   administration in macaques and humans and modulates amygdala reactivity
   in both species. However, the translation of neuromodulatory OXT effects
   to novel treatment approaches is hampered by the absence of studies
   defining the most effective dose and dose-response latency for targeting
   the amygdala.
   METHODS: To address this highly relevant issue, a total of 116 healthy
   men underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging using a randomized,
   double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study design. The
   experimental rationale was to systematically vary dose-test latencies
   (15-40, 45-70, and 75-100 minutes) and doses of OXT (12, 24, and 48
   international units) in order to identify the most robust effects on
   amygdala reactivity. During functional magnetic resonance imaging,
   subjects completed an emotional face recognition task including stimuli
   with varying intensities ranging from low (highly ambiguous) to high
   (less ambiguous).
   RESULTS: Our results indicate that the OXT-induced inhibition of
   amygdala responses to fear was most effective in a time window between
   45 and 70 minutes after administration of a dose of 24 international
   units. Furthermore, the observed effect was most evident in subjects
   scoring high on measures of autistic-like traits. Behavioral response
   patterns suggest that OXT specifically reduced an emotional bias in the
   perception of ambiguous faces.
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide initial evidence of the most
   effective dose and dose-test interval for future experimental or
   therapeutic regimens aimed at targeting amygdala functioning using
   intranasal OXT administration.}},

Abstract = {{Network interactions are likely to be instrumental in processes
   underlying rapid perception and cognition. Specifically, high-level and
   perceptual regions must interact to balance pre-existing models of the
   environment with new incoming stimuli. Simultaneous
   electro-encephalography (EEG) and fMRI (EEG/fMRI) enables temporal
   characterization of brain-network interactions combined with improved
   anatomical localization of regional activity. In this paper, we use
   simultaneous EEG/fMRI and multivariate dynamical systems (MDS) analysis
   to characterize network relationships between constitute brain areas
   that reflect a subject's choice for a face versus nonface categorization
   task. Our simultaneous EEG and fMRI analysis on 21 human subjects (12
   males, 9 females) identifies early perceptual and late frontal
   subsystems that are selective to the categorical choice of faces versus
   nonfaces. We analyze the interactions between these subsystems using an
   MDS in the space of the BOLD signal. Our main findings show that
   differences between face-choice and house-choice networks are seen in
   the network interactions between the early and late subsystems, and that
   the magnitude of the difference in network interaction positively
   correlates with the behavioral false-positive rate of face choices. We
   interpret this to reflect the role of saliency and expectations likely
   encoded in frontal ``late{''} regions on perceptual processes occurring
   in ``early{''} perceptual regions.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 12}},
Abstract = {{The dual process model of moral decision-making suggests that decisions
   to reject causing harm on moral dilemmas (where causing harm saves
   lives) reflect concern for others. Recently, some theorists have
   suggested such decisions actually reflect self-focused concern about
   causing harm, rather than witnessing others suffering. We examined brain
   activity while participants witnessed needles pierce another person's
   hand, versus similar non-painful stimuli. More than a month later,
   participants completed moral dilemmas where causing harm either did or
   did not maximize outcomes. We employed process dissociation to
   independently assess harm-rejection (deontological) and
   outcome-maximization (utilitarian) response tendencies. Activity in the
   posterior inferior frontal cortex (pIFC) while participants witnessed
   others in pain predicted deontological, but not utilitarian, response
   tendencies. Previous brain stimulation studies have shown that the pIFC
   seems crucial for sensorimotor representations of observed harm. Hence,
   these findings suggest that deontological response tendencies reflect
   genuine other-oriented concern grounded in sensorimotor representations
   of harm.}},

Title = {{Neural correlates of motor-cognitive dual-tasking in young and old
   adults}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{When two tasks are performed simultaneously, performance often declines
   in one or both tasks. These so-called dual-task costs are more
   pronounced in old than in young adults. One proposed neurological
   mechanism of the dual-task costs is that old compared with young adults
   tend to execute single-tasks with higher brain activation. In the brain
   regions that are needed for both tasks, the reduced residual capacity
   may interfere with performance of the dual-task. This competition for
   shared brain regions has been called structural interference. The
   purpose of the study was to determine whether structural interference
   indeed plays a role in the age-related decrease in dual-task
   performance. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to
   investigate 23 young adults (20-29 years) and 32 old adults (66-89
   years) performing a calculation (serial subtraction by seven) and
   balance-simulation (plantar flexion force control) task separately or
   simultaneously. Behavioral performance decreased during the dual-task
   compared with the single-tasks in both age groups, with greater
   dual-task costs in old compared with young adults. Brain activation was
   significantly higher in old than young adults during all conditions.
   Region of interest analyses were performed on brain regions that were
   active in both tasks. Structural interference was apparent in the right
   insula, as quantified by an age-related reduction in upregulation of
   brain activity from single-to dual-task. However, the magnitude of
   upregulation did not correlate with dual-task costs. Therefore, we
   conclude that the greater dual-task costs in old adults were probably
   not due to increased structural interference.}},

Title = {{Magnetic resonance imaging analysis of brain function in patients with
   irritable bowel syndrome}},
Journal = {{BMC GASTROENTEROLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional
   disease of the gastrointestinal tract. The current study aimed to
   examine the association between visceral hypersensitivity in IBS and
   cortical activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (WIRD,
   and to elucidate the role of psychological factors in the pathogenesis
   of IBS.
   Methods: The present study included 31 patients with IBS and 20 healthy
   controls. Cerebral function was assessed using fMRI. During imaging, a
   Sengstaken-Blakemore tube was placed within the rectum approximately 10
   cm from the anus, following which gas was rapidly injected into the
   airbag using a 150-m1 syringe. Images were obtained at 40 ml, 80 ml, and
   120 ml of expansion. Psychological status was evaluated using the
   Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).
   Results: Anxiety and depression scores were higher among patients with
   IBSthan among controls (both P < 0.05), although scores in both groups
   were below the level of clinical diagnosis. Brain activation in regions
   of interest (parietal areas, prefrontal cortex, cerebellum, anterior
   cingulate cortex, insular cortex, and thalamus) increased along with
   increases in rectal balloon dilation, except in women with IBS and
   patients with disease duration less than 5 years. Furthermore, region of
   interest (ROI) activation (such as the parietal region, prefrontal
   cortex, cerebellum, anterior cingulate cortex, insular cortex, and
   thalamus) differed significantly between the 40-ml and 120-ml
   conditions, and between the 80-ml and 120-ml conditions (P < 0.05),
   among patients with IBS with anxiety or depression scores less than 9
   points.
   Conclusions: Overall, our findings indicate that changes in brain
   activation due to changes in rectal balloon distension can be
   objectively and accurately measured using fMRI. Although our results
   indicated that visceral hypersensitivity during IBS is associated with
   changes in cortical activation, further studies utilizing larger sample
   sizes are required to more fully elucidate the association between
   psychological factors and visceral hypersensitivity in IBS.}},

Title = {{Impaired mixed emotion processing in the right ventrolateral prefrontal
   cortex in schizophrenia: an fMRI study}},
Journal = {{BMC PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Schizophrenia has a negative effect on the activity of the
   temporal and prefrontal cortices in the processing of emotional facial
   expressions. However no previous research focused on the evaluation of
   mixed emotions in schizophrenia, albeit they are frequently expressed in
   everyday situations and negative emotions are frequently expressed by
   mixed facial expressions.
   Methods: Altogether 37 subjects, 19 patients with schizophrenia and 18
   healthy control subjects were enrolled in the study. The two study
   groups did not differ in age and education. The stimulus set consisted
   of 10 fearful (100\%), 10 happy (100\%), 10 mixed fear (70\% fear and
   30\% happy) and 10 mixed happy facial expressions. During the fMRI
   acquisition pictures were presented in a randomized order and subjects
   had to categorize expressions by button press.
   Results: A decreased activation was found in the patient group during
   fear, mixed fear and mixed happy processing in the right ventrolateral
   prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and the right anterior insula (RAI) at voxel
   and cluster level after familywise error correction. No difference was
   found between study groups in activations to happy facial condition.
   Patients with schizophrenia did not show a differential activation
   between mixed happy and happy facial expression similar to controls in
   the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).
   Conclusions: Patients with schizophrenia showed decreased functioning in
   right prefrontal regions responsible for salience signaling and valence
   evaluation during emotion recognition. Our results indicate that fear
   and mixed happy/fear processing are impaired in schizophrenia, while
   happy facial expression processing is relatively intact.}},

Title = {{Impact of self-esteem and sex on stress reactions}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{Positive self-evaluation is a major psychological resource modulating
   stress coping behavior. Sex differences have been reported in
   self-esteem as well as stress reactions, but so far their interactions
   have not been investigated. Therefore, we investigated sex-specific
   associations of self-esteem and stress reaction on behavioral, hormonal
   and neural levels. We applied a commonly used fMRI-stress task in 80
   healthy participants. Men compared to women showed higher activation
   during stress in hippocampus, precuneus, superior temporal gyrus (STG)
   and insula. Furthermore, men outperformed women in the stress task and
   had higher cortisol and testosterone levels than women after stress.
   Selfesteem had an impact on precuneus, insula and STG activation during
   stress across the whole group. During stress, men recruit regions
   associated with emotion and stress regulation, self-referential
   processing and cognitive control more strongly than women. Self-esteem
   affects stress processing, however in a sex-independent fashion:
   participants with lower self-esteem show higher activation of regions
   involved in emotion and stress regulation, self-referential processing
   and cognitive control. Taken together, our data suggest that men are
   more engaged during the applied stress task. Across women and men, lower
   self-esteem increases the effort in emotion and stress processing and
   cognitive control, possibly leading to self-related thoughts in
   stressful situations.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{The social brain hypothesis argues that the need to deal with social
   challenges was key to our evolution of high intelligence. Research with
   non-human primates as well as experimental and fMRI studies in humans
   produce results consistent with this claim, leading to an estimate that
   human primary groups should consist of roughly 150 individuals. Gaps
   between this prediction and empirical observations can be partially
   accounted for using ``compression heuristics{''}, or schemata that
   simplify the encoding and recall of social information. However, little
   is known about the specific algorithmic processes used by humans to
   store and recall social information. We describe a mechanistic model of
   human network recall and demonstrate its sufficiency for capturing human
   recall behavior observed in experimental contexts. We find that human
   recall is predicated on accurate recall of a small number of high degree
   network nodes and the application of heuristics for both structural and
   affective information. This provides new insight into human memory,
   social network evolution, and demonstrates a novel approach to
   uncovering human cognitive operations.}},

Title = {{The Neural Basis of Social Influence in a Dictator Decision}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 6}},
Abstract = {{Humans tend to reduce inequitable distributions. Previous neuroimaging
   studies have shown that inequitable decisions are related to brain
   regions that associated with negative emotion and signaling conflict. In
   the highly complex human social environment, our opinions and behaviors
   can be affected by social information. In current study, we used a
   modified dictator game to investigate the effect of social influence on
   making an equitable decision. We found that the choices of participants
   in present task was influenced by the choices of peers. However,
   participants' decisions were influenced by equitable rather than
   inequitable group choices. fMRI results showed that brain regions that
   related to norm violation and social conflict were related to the
   inequitable social influence. The neural responses in the dorsomedial
   prefrontal cortex, rostral cingulate zone, and insula predicted
   subsequent conforming behavior in individuals. Additionally,
   psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed that the
   interconnectivity between the dorsal striatum and insula was elevated in
   advantageous inequity influence versus no-social influence conditions.
   We found decreased functional connectivity between the medial prefrontal
   cortex and insula, supplementary motor area, posterior cingulate gyrus
   and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in the disadvantageous inequity
   influence versus no-social influence conditions. This suggests that a
   disadvantageous inequity influence may decrease the functional
   connectivity among brain regions that are related to reward processes.
   Thus, the neural mechanisms underlying social influence in an equitable
   decision may be similar to those implicated in social norms and reward
   processing.}},

Title = {{Frequency-Specific Functional Connectivity Density as an Effective
   Biomarker for Adolescent Generalized Anxiety Disorder}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{Several neuropsychiatric diseases have been found to influence the
   frequency-specific spontaneous functional brain organization (SFBO) in
   resting state, demonstrating that the abnormal brain activities of
   different frequency bands are associated with various physiological and
   psychological dysfunctions. However, little is known about the frequency
   specificities of SFBO in adolescent generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).
   Here, a novel complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with
   adaptive noise method was applied to decompose the time series of each
   voxel across all participants (31 adolescent patients with GAD and 28
   matched healthy controls; HCs) into four frequency-specific bands with
   distinct intrinsic oscillation. The functional connectivity density
   (FCD) of different scales (short-range and long-range) was calculated to
   quantify the SFBO changes related to GAD within each above
   frequency-specific band and the conventional frequency band (0.01-0.08
   Hz). Support vector machine classifier was further used to examine the
   discriminative ability of the frequency-specific FCD values. The results
   showed that adolescent GAD patients exhibited abnormal alterations of
   both short-range and long-range FCD (S-FCD and L-FCD) in widespread
   brain regions across three frequency-specific bands. Positive
   correlation between the State Anxiety Inventory (SAI) score and
   increased L-FCD in the fusiform gyrus in the conventional frequency band
   was found in adolescents with GAD. Both S-FCD and L-FCD in the insula in
   the lower frequency band (0.02-0.036 Hz) had the highest classification
   performance compared to all other brain regions with inter-group
   difference. Furthermore, a satisfactory classification performance was
   achieved by combining the discrepant S-FCD and L-FCD values in all
   frequency bands, with the area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.9414 and
   the corresponding sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 87.15,
   92.92, and 89.83\%, respectively. This study indicates that the
   alterations of SFBO in adolescent GAD are frequency dependence and the
   frequency-specific FCD can potentially serve as a valuable biomarker in
   discriminating GAD patients from HCs. These findings may provide new
   insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of adolescent GAD.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the neural and behavioral effects of voice gender
   and message framing in ecological advertising by means of functional MRI
   in conjunction with a task presenting persuasive gain-framed (GF) or
   loss-framed (LF) messages pronounced by male voice (MV) and female voice
   (FV). Behavioral responses showed more positive attitudes toward ads
   comprising MVs and GF messages. A whole-brain analysis revealed that
   visual regions are strongly elicited by LF (vs. GF) messages, whereas an
   area related to personal value computing, future positive aspirations,
   and social benefits-namely, the anterior cingulate cortex-is strongly
   activated by GF (vs. LF) messages. The MV triggered stronger activation
   in areas related to pitch processing and visual scenes, whereas the FV
   provoked a higher neural-audiovisual integration. Furthermore, neural
   activation in the inferior frontal gyrus significantly predicted
   attitudes toward ads pronounced by the MV, and the activation in the
   orbitofrontal gyrus predicted attitudes toward ads comprising GF
   messages. Taken together, this article sheds light on a differential
   neural processing of gain and loss frames as well as MV and FV. It also
   suggests that messages expressing social benefits (e.g., environmental)
   could be processed differently from those reporting individual
   advantages (e.g., healthy). Finally, it advises managers and
   associations which market environmentally responsible products and ideas
   the voice and frame of the message which generate the highest
   subconscious value.}},

Abstract = {{Oxytocin ( OT) influences other-oriented mental processes ( e.g. trust
   and empathy) and the underlying neural substrates. However, whether and
   how OT modulates self-oriented processes and the underlying brain
   activity remains unclear. Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled
   between-subjects design, we manipulated memory encoding and retrieval of
   trait adjectives related to the self, a friend and a celebrity in a
   self-referential task in male adults. Experiment 1 ( N = 51) found that
   OT vs placebo treatments reduced response times during encoding
   self-related trait adjectives but increased recognition scores of
   self-related information during memory retrieval. Experiment 2 ( N = 50)
   showed similar OT effects on response times during encoding self-related
   trait adjectives. Moreover, functional magnetic resonance imaging (
   fMRI) results revealed that OT vs placebo treatments decreased the
   activity in the medial prefrontal cortex ( MPFC) involved in encoding of
   self-related trait adjectives and weakened the coupling between the MPFC
   activity and a cultural trait ( i.e. interdependence). Experiment 3 ( N
   = 52) revealed that OT vs placebo treatments increased the right
   superior frontal activity during memory retrieval of self-related
   information. The results provide behavioral and fMRI evidence for OT
   effects on self-referential processing and suggest distinct patterns of
   OT modulations of brain activities engaged in encoding and retrieval of
   self-related information.}},

Abstract = {{Although theoretical discourse and experimental studies on the self- and
   reward-biases have a long tradition, currently we have only a limited
   understanding of how the biases are represented in the brain and, more
   importantly, how they relate to each other. We used multi-voxel pattern
   analysis to test for common representations of self and reward in
   perceptual matching in healthy human subjects. Voxels across an
   anterior-posterior axis in ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( vmPFC)
   distinguished ( i) self-others and ( ii) high-low reward, but
   cross-generalization between these dimensions decreased from anterior to
   posterior vmPFC. The vmPFC is characterized by a shift from a common
   currency for value to independent, distributed representations of self
   and reward across an anterior-posterior axis. This shift reflected
   changes in functional connectivity between the posterior part of the
   vmPFC and the frontal pole when processing self- associated stimuli, and
   the middle frontal gyrus when processing stimuli associated with high
   reward. The changes in functional connectivity were correlated with
   behavioral biases, respectively, to the self and reward. The distinct
   representations of self and reward in the posterior vmPFC are associated
   with self- and reward-biases in behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The activities we choose to spend our leisure time with are
   intrinsically motivating and vary across individuals. Yet it is unknown
   how impulse control or neural activity changes when processing a
   preferred stimulus related to a hobby or interest. Developing a task
   that assesses the response to preferred interests is of importance as it
   would be relevant to a range of psychiatric disorders that have hyper-
   or hypo-arousal to such cues. During functional Magnetic Resonance
   Imaging ( fMRI), 39 healthy adults completed a novel task to test
   approach behavior and cognitive control to cues that were personalized
   to the participants' interests compared to stimuli the participants
   identified as being of non-interest and colored shapes. fMRI results
   showed that cues of one's interest elicited activation in the anterior
   insula compared to colored shapes. Interests did not change inhibition
   compared to non-interests and colored shapes and all stimuli equally
   engaged a frontostriatal circuit. Together the results suggest that
   adults were sensitive to their interests but were effective at
   regulating their impulses towards these cues, a skill that is critical
   for navigating the temptations and distractions in our daily
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{While a persuasion network has been proposed, little is known about how
   network connections between brain regions contribute to attitude change.
   Two possible mechanisms have been advanced. One hypothesis predicts that
   attitude change results from increased connectivity between structures
   implicated in affective and executive processing in response to
   increases in argument strength. A second functional perspective suggests
   that highly arousing messages reduce connectivity between structures
   implicated in the encoding of sensory information, which disrupts
   message processing and thereby inhibits attitude change. However,
   persuasion is a multi-determined construct that results from both
   message features and audience characteristics. Therefore, persuasive
   messages should lead to specific functional connectivity patterns among
   a priori defined structures within the persuasion network. The present
   study exposed 28 subjects to anti-drug public service announcements
   where arousal, argument strength, and subject drug-use risk were
   systematically varied. Psychophysiological interaction analyses provide
   support for the affective-executive hypothesis but not for the
   encoding-disruption hypothesis. Secondary analyses show that video-level
   connectivity patterns among structures within the persuasion network
   predict audience responses in independent samples ( one college-aged,
   one nationally representative). We propose that persuasion neuroscience
   research is best advanced by considering network-level effects while
   accounting for interactions between message features and target audience
   characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{The current study aimed to capture empathy processing in an
   interpersonal context. Mother-adolescent dyads ( N = 22) each completed
   an empathy task during fMRI, in which they imagined the target person in
   distressing scenes as either themselves or their family ( i.e. child for
   the mother, mother for the child). Using multi-voxel pattern approach,
   we compared neural pattern similarity for the self and family conditions
   and found that mothers showed greater perceptual similarity between self
   and child in the fusiform face area ( FFA), representing high self-child
   overlap, whereas adolescents showed significantly less self-mother
   overlap. Adolescents' pattern similarity was dependent upon family
   relationship quality, such that they showed greater self-mother overlap
   with higher relationship quality, whereas mothers' pattern similarity
   was independent of relationship quality. Furthermore, adolescents'
   perceptual similarity in the FFA was associated with increased social
   brain activation ( e.g. temporal parietal junction). Mediation analyses
   indicated that high relationship quality was associated with greater
   social brain activation, which was mediated by greater self-mother
   overlap in the FFA. Our findings suggest that adolescents show more
   distinct neural patterns in perceiving their own vs their mother's
   distress, and such distinction is sensitive to mother-child relationship
   quality. In contrast, mothers' perception for their own and child's
   distress is highly similar and unconditional.}},

Abstract = {{Self-control and the ability to resist temptation are critical for
   successful completion of long-term goals. Contemporary models in
   cognitive neuroscience emphasize the primary role of prefrontal
   cognitive control networks in aligning behavior with such goals. Here,
   we use gaze pattern analysis and dynamic functional connectivity fMRI
   data to explore how individual differences in the ability to resist
   temptation are related to intrinsic brain dynamics of the cognitive
   control and salience networks. Behaviorally, individuals exhibit greater
   gaze distance from target location ( e.g. higher distractibility) during
   presentation of tempting erotic images compared with neutral images.
   Individuals whose intrinsic dynamic functional connectivity patterns
   gravitate toward configurations in which salience detection systems are
   less strongly coupled with visual systems resist tempting distractors
   more effectively. The ability to resist tempting distractors was not
   significantly related to intrinsic dynamics of the cognitive control
   network. These results suggest that susceptibility to temptation is
   governed in part by individual differences in salience network dynamics
   and provide novel evidence for involvement of brain systems outside
   canonical cognitive control networks in contributing to individual
   differences in self-control.}},

Abstract = {{Fluency with simple arithmetic, typically achieved in early elementary
   school, is thought to be one of the building blocks of mathematical
   competence. Behavioral studies with adults indicate that math anxiety (
   feelings of tension or apprehension about math) is associated with poor
   performance on cognitively demanding math problems. However, it remains
   unclear whether there are fundamental differences in how high and low
   math anxious individuals approach overlearned simple arithmetic problems
   that are less reliant on cognitive control. The current study used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the neural correlates
   of simple arithmetic performance across high and low math anxious
   individuals. We implemented a partial least squares analysis, a
   data-driven, multivariate analysis method to measure distributed
   patterns of whole-brain activity associated with performance. Despite
   overall high simple arithmetic performance across high and low math
   anxious individuals, performance was differentially dependent on the
   fronto-parietal attentional network as a function of math anxiety.
   Specifically, low-compared to high-math anxious individuals perform
   better when they activate this network less-a potential indication of
   more automatic problem-solving. These findings suggest that low and high
   math anxious individuals approach even the most fundamental math
   problems differently.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to form positive mental images may be an important aspect of
   mental health and well-being. We have previously demonstrated that the
   vividness of positive prospective imagery is increased in healthy older
   adults following positive imagery cognitive training. The rostral
   anterior cingulate cortex ( rACC) is involved in the simulation of
   future affective episodes. Here, we investigate the effect of positive
   imagery training on rACC activity during the imagination of novel,
   ambiguous scenarios vs closely matched control training. Seventy-five
   participants received 4 weeks of positive imagery or control training.
   Participants underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan,
   during which they completed an Ambiguous Sentences Task, which required
   them to form mental images in response to cues describing ambiguous
   social events. rACC activity was positively correlated with the
   pleasantness ratings of images formed. Positive imagery training
   increased rACC and bilateral hippocampal activity compared with the
   control training. Here, we demonstrate that rACC activity during
   positive imagery can be changed by the cognitive training. This is
   consistent with other evidence that this training enhances the vividness
   of positive imagery, and suggests the training may be acting to increase
   the intensity and affective quality of imagery simulating the future.}},

Abstract = {{As models of shared expectations, social norms play an essential role in
   our societies. Since our social environment is changing constantly, our
   internal models of it also need to change. In humans, there is mounting
   evidence that neural structures such as the insula and the ventral
   striatum are involved in detecting norm violation and updating internal
   models. However, because of methodological challenges, little is known
   about the possible involvement of midbrain structures in detecting norm
   violation and updating internal models of our norms. Here, we used
   high-resolution cardiac-gated functional magnetic resonance imaging and
   a norm adaptation paradigm in healthy adults to investigate the role of
   the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area ( SN/VTA) complex in
   tracking signals related to norm violation that can be used to update
   internal norms. We show that the SN/VTA codes for the norm's variance
   prediction error ( PE) and norm PE with spatially distinct regions
   coding for negative and positive norm PE. These results point to a
   common role played by the SN/VTA complex in supporting both simple
   reward-based and social decision making.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores the developing relationship between
   neuroscientific under-standings of `addiction' and `youth'. Drawing on
   science and technology studies theory and social scientific analyses of
   both these concepts, it identifies a co-constitutive relationship
   between notions of addiction as a brain disease and of youth as a stage
   of brain development. These two concepts are then tracked in a series of
   drug education documents concerned with alcohol and other drug (AOD) use
   and addiction among young people, and their implications and effects and
   analysed together. The aim is to investigate the impact on drug
   education of neuroscientific approaches to youth and addiction. Are new
   concepts and directions for harm reduction created in the encounters
   between neuroscience, youth and addiction, or do they simply reinstate
   and reinforce existing assumptions and judgments? Is drug education
   shaped by these concepts likely to achieve its aim, that is, to increase
   young people's sensitivity to harm and safety? The article begins by
   introducing neuroscientific accounts of youth and addiction, arguing
   that the two concepts share three key assumptions. First, both emphasise
   biology and sideline social context in the making of drug use practices
   and outcomes. Second, both reproduce uncritical treatments of brain
   scans (PET and fMRI images) as windows into minds and subjects. Third,
   both understand the brain as ontologically separate from its
   environment. These assumptions and their implications are then tracked
   through an analysis of Australian drug education resources, focusing on
   how drug education constitutes youthfulness and addiction as
   pathological disorders. In its reliance on neuroscientific
   understandings of youth and addiction, we conclude, drug education is
   unlikely to achieve its goal of reducing drug-related harm.}},

Abstract = {{Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to recognize thoughts and emotions of
   another, may be one of the cognitive domains affected in amyotrophic
   lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease now recognized as a
   multi-system disorder. The present study aimed to identify early
   dysfunctions of brain resting state functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (RS-fMRI) networks in a group of ALS patients longitudinally
   explored for impairment of ``cognitive{''} and ``affective{''} ToM
   subcomponents.
   RS-fMRI connectivity was investigated in a group of 21 patients with ALS
   (i.e., 9 with bulbar-onset or ALS-B and 12 with limb-onset or ALS-L) in
   early stages of disease and 15 healthy controls (HCs). The same subjects
   were assessed, at baseline and after six months, for neuropsychological
   performances, including cognitive and affective ToM and multi domain
   cognitive functions.
   The RS-fMRI study showed a decreased connectivity in frontotemporal
   areas within the main cognitive resting state networks, including the
   default mode (DMN), the right and left fronto-parietal (R-, L-FPN), and
   the salience (SLN) networks, in the entire ALS group. As exploratory
   results, comparing the ALS-B subgroup to the ALS-L one, we revealed a
   widespread decrease of RS-fMRI signals in the left middle frontal gyrus
   for L-FPN and SLN and in the left superior frontal gyrus for SLN. At
   baseline, no ToM or other cognitive abnormalities were reported in the
   entire group of ALS patients compared to HCs, although, after six
   months, the ALS-B subset exhibited a significant impairment of both
   affective and cognitive ToM subcomponents, whereas the ALS-L group
   showed significant impairment of the cognitive subcomponent alone.
   Our findings provide original evidence of the deficit of both ToM
   subcomponents during the ALS course, supporting the hypothesis of a
   biologically more aggressive character of ALS-B. Moreover, early RS-fMRI
   abnormalities in cognitive networks may underlie and precede the
   clinical appearance of ToM alterations in ALS. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{CORTEX}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{183-201}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Humans generate recursive hierarchies in a variety of domains, including
   linguistic, social and visuo-spatial modalities. The ability to
   represent recursive structures has been hypothesized to increase the
   efficiency of hierarchical processing. Theoretical work together with
   recent empirical findings suggests that the ability to represent the
   self-similar structure of hierarchical recursive stimuli may be
   supported by internal neural representations that compress raw external
   information and increase efficiency.
   In order to explicitly test whether the representation of recursive
   hierarchies depends on internalized rules we compared the processing of
   visual hierarchies represented either as recursive or non-recursive,
   using task-free resting-state fMRI data. We aimed to evaluate the
   relationship between task-evoked functional networks induced ``by
   cognitive representations with the corresponding resting-state
   architecture. We observed increased connectivity within Default Mode
   Network (DMN) related brain areas during the representation of
   recursion, while non-recursive representations yielded increased
   connectivity within the Fronto-Parietal Control-Network.
   Our results suggest that human hierarchical information processing using
   recursion is supported by the DMN. In particular, the representation of
   recursion seems to constitute an internally-biased mode of
   information-processing that is mediated by both the core and
   dorsal-medial subsystems of the DMN. Compressed internal rule
   representations mediated by the DMN may help humans to represent and
   process hierarchical structures in complex environments by considerably
   reducing information processing load. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{122}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{6-16}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The extensive use of gestures for human-human communication,
   independently of culture and language, suggests an underlying universal
   neural mechanism for gesture recognition. The mirror neuron system (MNS)
   is known to respond to observed human actions, and overlaps with
   self-action. The minimal cues needed for activation of the MNS for
   gesture recognition, facial expressions and bodily dynamics, is not yet
   defined. Using LED point representations of gestures, we compared two
   types of brain activations: 1) in response to human recognizable vs
   non-recognizable motion and 2) in response to human vs non-human motion.
   Our preliminary results show that parts of the MNS respond only to human
   kinematics, and not to nonhuman kinematics, suggesting that the brain
   has a mechanism of discriminating human from nonhuman motion, even if
   the pattern of motion is meaningless, but still follows biological
   motion patterns. This implies that mechanisms of learning-mimicking,
   empathy and emotional communication, are possibly constrained by
   biological motion patterns. We then suggest a two-tier-model of
   human-bodily-communication: (1) recognition of human biological
   kinematics; (2) recognition of meaning. Implications are both
   theoretical (understanding the underlying mechanism for action
   recognition) and applicative (in digital graphical social
   representations, motion should be reasonably biological to generate the
   same emotional and mimicking automatic mechanisms as in face-to-face
   social interactions). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Disrupted cortico-limbic connectivity during reward processing in
   remitted bipolar I disorder}},
Journal = {{BIPOLAR DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{661-675}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{ObjectivesBipolar disorder (BD) is associated with elevated reward
   sensitivity and persistent positive affect, yet the neural mechanisms
   underlying these patterns are not well understood. In the present study,
   we examined putative disruptions in communication within a well-known
   cortico-limbic reward circuit during reward processing as a potential
   contributing mechanism to these symptoms.
   MethodsThe present investigation employed a within- and between-subjects
   design utilizing a monetary and social incentive delay task among adults
   with bipolar disorder type I (BD; N=24) and a healthy non-psychiatric
   control group (HC; N=25) during functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI). Participants in the BD group were remitted at the time of
   testing.
   ResultsFunctional connectivity analyses revealed increased connectivity
   between the ventral striatum (VS) seed region and orbitofrontal cortex
   (OFC) as well as the amygdala during processing of reward receipt in the
   BD group. After omission of expected rewards, the BD group showed
   decreased functional connectivity between the VS and a medial
   frontopolar cortex (mFPC) region associated with consideration of
   behavioral alternatives. Follow-up analyses within the BD group showed
   that increased VS-OFC connectivity after reward receipt, and decreased
   VS-mFPC connected after reward omission, were associated with higher
   levels of subthreshold mania symptoms.
   ConclusionsResults point toward potential mechanisms implicated in
   elevated reward sensitivity in BD. Enhanced VS-OFC connectivity after
   reward receipt may be involved in elevated valuation of rewards whereas
   blunted VS-mFPC connectivity after reward omission may reflect a failure
   to consider behavioral alternatives to reward pursuit.}},

Abstract = {{Irony comprehension requires integration of social contextual
   information. Previous studies have investigated temporal aspects of
   irony processing and its neural substrates using
   psychological/electroencephalogram or functional magnetic resonance

   magnetoencephalography to investigate the neural generators of
   alpha-band (8-13 Hz) event-related desynchronization (ERD) occurring
   from 600 to 900 ms following the onset of a critical sentence at which
   social situational contexts activated ironic representation. We found
   that the right anterior temporal lobe, which is involved in processing
   social knowledge and evaluating others' intentions, exhibited stronger
   alpha ERD following an ironic statement than following a literal
   statement. We also found that alpha power in the left anterior temporal
   lobe correlated with the participants' communication abilities. These
   results elucidate the temporospatial neural mechanisms of language
   comprehension in social contexts, including non-literal processing.}},

Abstract = {{This study extended cross-language semantic decoding (based on a
   concept's fMRI signature) to the decoding of sentences across three
   different languages (English, Portuguese and Mandarin). A classifier was
   trained on either the mapping between words and activation patterns in
   one language or the mappings in two languages (using an equivalent
   amount of training data), and then tested on its ability to decode the
   semantic content of a third language. The model trained on two languages
   was reliably more accurate than a classifier trained on one language for
   all three pairs of languages. This two-language advantage was selective
   to abstract concept domains such as social interactions and mental
   activity. Representational Similarity Analyses (RSA) of the
   inter-sentence neural similarities resulted in similar clustering of
   sentences in all the three languages, indicating a shared neural concept
   space among languages. These findings identify semantic domains that are
   common across these three languages versus those that are more language
   or culture-specific.}},

Abstract = {{Social status is a salient cue that shapes our perceptions of other
   people and ultimately guides our social interactions. Despite the
   pervasive influence of status on social behavior, how information about
   the status of others is represented in the brain remains unclear. Here,
   we tested the hypothesis that social status information is embedded in
   our neural representations of other individuals. Participants learned to
   associate faces with names, job titles that varied in associated status,
   and explicit markers of reputational status (star ratings). Trained
   stimuli were presented in an functional magnetic resonance imaging
   experiment where participants performed a target detection task
   orthogonal to the variable of interest. A network of face-selective
   brain regions extending from the occipital lobe to the orbitofrontal
   cortex was localized and served as regions of interest. Using multivoxel
   pattern analysis, we found that face-selective voxels in the lateral
   orbitofrontal cortex - a region involved in social and nonsocial
   valuation, could decode faces based on their status. Similar effects
   were observed with two different status manipulations - one based on
   stored semantic knowledge (e.g., different careers) and one based on
   learned reputation (e.g., star ranking). These data suggest that a
   face-selective region of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex may contribute
   to the perception of social status, potentially underlying the
   preferential attention and favorable biases humans display toward
   high-status individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Exposure therapy is an effective treatment for posttraumatic
   stress disorder (PTSD), but a comprehensive, emotion-focused perspective
   on how psychotherapy affects brain function is lacking. The authors
   assessed changes in brain function after prolonged exposure therapy
   across three emotional reactivity and regulation paradigms.
   Method: Individuals with PTSD underwent functional MRI (fMRI) at rest
   and while completing three tasks assessing emotional reactivity and
   regulation. Individuals were then randomly assigned to immediate
   prolonged exposure treatment (N = 36) or awaiting list condition (N =
   30) and underwent a second scan approximately 4 weeks after the last
   treatment session or a comparable waiting period, respectively.
   Results: Treatment-specific changes were observed only during cognitive
   reappraisal of negative images. Psychotherapy increased lateral
   frontopolar cortex activity and connectivity with the ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex/ventral striatum. Greater increases in frontopolar
   activation were associated with improvement in hyperarousal symptoms and
   psychological well-being. The frontopolar cortex also displayeda greater
   varietyof temporal resting-state signal pattern changes after treatment.
   Concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation and fMRI in healthy
   participants demonstrated that the lateral frontopolar cortex exerts
   downstream influence on the ventromedial prefrontal cortex/ventral
   striatum.
   Conclusions: Changes in frontopolar function during deliberate
   regulation of negative affect is one key mechanism of adaptive
   psychotherapeutic change in PTSD. Given that frontopolar connectivity
   with ventromedial regions during emotion regulation is enhanced by
   psychotherapy and that the frontopolar cortex exerts downstream
   influence on ventromedial regions in healthy individuals, these findings
   inform a novel conceptualization of how psychotherapy works, and they
   identify a promising target for stimulationbased therapeutics.}},

Abstract = {{The use of emotion in language is a key element of human interactions
   and a rich area for cognitive research. The present study examined

   negative emotion (e.g., hatred), positive emotion-laden (e.g.,
   blessing), negative emotion-laden (e.g., prison), and neutral (e.g.,
   chance). Words and nonwords were intermixed in a lexical decision task
   using hemifield presentation. Results revealed a general left hemisphere
   advantage. Overall, reaction times for positive words were faster than
   for negative or neutral words and this effect varied by hemifield of
   presentation. These results support a valence hypothesis of specialized
   processing in the left hemisphere of the brain for positive emotions and
   the right hemisphere for negative emotions.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to suppress responses that are inappropriate, as well as the
   mechanisms monitoring the accuracy of actions in order to compensate for
   errors, is central to human behavior. Neural alterations that prevent
   stopping an inaccurate response, combined with a decreased ability of
   error monitoring, are considered to be prominent features of alcohol
   abuse. Moreover, (i) alterations of these processes have been reported
   in heavy social drinkers (i.e. young healthy individuals who do not yet
   exhibit a state of alcohol dependence); and (ii) through longitudinal
   studies, these alterations have been shown to underlie subsequent
   disinhibition that may lead to future alcohol use disorders. In the
   present functional magnetic resonance imaging study, using a contextual
   Go/No-Go task, we investigated whether different neural networks
   subtended correct inhibitions and monitoring mechanisms of failed
   inhibitory trials in light versus heavy social drinkers. We show that,
   although successful inhibition did not lead to significant changes,
   neural networks involved in error monitoring are different in light
   versus heavy drinkers. Thus, while light drinkers exhibited activations
   in their right inferior frontal, right middle cingulate and left
   superior temporal areas; heavy drinkers exhibited activations in their
   right cerebellum, left caudate nucleus, left superior occipital region,
   and left amygdala. These data are functionally interpreted as reflecting
   a ``visually-driven emotional strategy{''} vs. an ``executive-based{''}
   neural response to errors in heavy and light drinkers, respectively.
   Such a difference is interpreted as a key-factor that may subtend the
   transition from a controlled social heavy consumption to a state of
   clinical alcohol dependence.}},

Abstract = {{Nonstigmatized perceivers' initial evaluations of stigmatized
   individuals have profound consequences for the well-being of those
   stigmatized individuals. However, the mechanism by which this occurs
   remains underexplored. Specifically, what beliefs about the stigmatized
   condition (stigma-related beliefs) shape how nonstigmatized perceivers
   evaluate and behave toward stigmatized individuals? We examined these
   questions with respect to depression-related stigmatization because
   depression is highly stigmatized and nondepressed individuals' behavior
   (e.g., willingness to recommend treatment) directly relates to removing
   stigma and increasing well-being. In Study 1, we identified common
   stigma-related beliefs associated with depression (e.g., not a serious
   illness, controllable, threatening), and found that only perceptions
   that depression is a serious condition predicted nondepressed
   perceivers' willingness to recommend mental health treatment. Moreover,
   perceivers' beliefs that depression is a distressing condition mediated
   the relationship between perceived seriousness and treatment
   recommendations (Study 1). In Study 2, we used fMRI to disentangle the
   potential processes connecting distress to nondepressed perceivers'
   self-reported treatment intentions. Heightened activity in the
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC)-a region widely implicated in
   evaluating others-and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC)-a
   region widely implicated in regulating negative emotions-emerged when
   nondepressed perceivers evaluated individuals who were ostensibly
   depressed. Beliefs that depression is a distressing condition mediated
   the relationship between dmPFC (but not vlPFC) activity and nondepressed
   individuals' self-reported treatment recommendations.}},

Abstract = {{Insufficient sleep, as well as the incidence of anxiety disorders, both
   peak during adolescence. While both conditions present perturbations in
   fear-processing-related neurocircuitry, it is unknown whether these
   neurofunctional alterations directly link anxiety and compromised sleep
   in adolescents. Fourteen anxious adolescents (AAs) and 19 healthy
   adolescents (HAs) were compared on a measure of sleep amount and neural
   responses to negatively valenced faces during fMRI. Group differences in
   neural response to negative faces emerged in the dorsal anterior
   cingulate cortex (dACC) and the hippocampus. In both regions,
   correlation of sleep amount with BOLD activation was positive in AAs,
   but negative in HAs. Follow-up psychophysiological interaction (PPI)
   analyses indicated positive connectivity between dACC and dorsomedial
   prefrontal cortex, and between hippocampus and insula. This connectivity
   was correlated negatively with sleep amount in AAs, but positively in
   HAs. In conclusion, the presence of clinical anxiety modulated the
   effects of sleep-amount on neural reactivity to negative faces
   differently among this group of adolescents, which may contribute to
   different clinical significance and outcomes of sleep disturbances in
   healthy adolescents and patients with anxiety disorders.}},

Abstract = {{The degree to which social norms are processed by a unitary system or
   dissociable systems remains debated. Much research on children's
   social-cognitive judgments has supported the distinction between
   ``moral{''} (harm/welfare-based) and ``conventional{''} norms. However,
   the extent to which these norms are processed by dissociable neural
   systems remains unclear. To address this issue, 23 healthy participants
   were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while
   they rated the wrongness of harm/welfare-based and conventional
   transgressions and neutral vignettes. Activation significantly greater
   than the neutral vignette baseline was observed in regions implicated in
   decision-making regions including rostral/ventral medial frontal,
   anterior insula and dorsomedial frontal cortices when evaluating both
   harm/welfare-based and social-conventional transgressions. Greater
   activation when rating harm/welfare-based relative to
   social-conventional transgressions was seen through much of ACC and
   bilateral inferior frontal gyrus. Greater activation was observed in
   superior temporal gyrus, bilateral middle temporal gyrus, left PCC, and
   temporal-parietal junction when rating social-conventional
   transgressions relative to harm/welfare-based transgressions. These data
   suggest that decisions regarding the wrongness of actions, irrespective
   of whether they involve care/harm-based or conventional transgressions,
   recruit regions generally implicated in affect-based decision-making.
   However, there is neural differentiation between harm/welfare-based and
   conventional transgressions. This may reflect the particular importance
   of processing the intent of transgressors of conventional norms and
   perhaps the greater emotional content or salience of harm/welfare-based
   transgressions.}},

Abstract = {{Do we actively maintain monogamous relationships by force of will, or
   does monogamy flow automatically? During functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI), male participants in a romantic relationship performed
   the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to evaluate implicit attitudes
   toward adultery and a go/no-go task to measure prefrontal activity
   implicated in explicit executive control. Subsequently, they were
   engaged in a date-rating task in which they rated how much they wanted
   to date unfamiliar females. We found that the individuals with higher
   prefrontal activity during go/no-go task could regulate the interest for
   dates with unattractive females; moreover, the individuals with both a
   stronger negative attitude toward adultery and higher prefrontal
   activity could regulate their interest for dates with attractive
   females, and such individuals tended to maintain longer romantic
   relationships with a particular partner. These results indicate that
   regulation of amorous temptation via monogamous relationship is affected
   by the combination of automatic and reflective processes.}},

Abstract = {{Human action perception is so powerful that people can identify movement
   efficiently in the absence of pictorial information, such as in
   point-light displays. Interest is growing in this type of stimulus for
   research in neuroscience. This interest stems from the advantage of
   separating the component of pure human action kinematics from other
   pictorial information, such as facial expression and muscle contraction.
   Although several groups have previously developed datasets of human
   point-light actions, due to the lack of datasets composed of daily
   actions with short durations, we developed 20 biological and 40 control
   (scrambled) point-light movements by using the technique of recording
   people wearing reflector patches. The videos are about 1 s long.
   Subsequently, we performed a judgment task in which 100 participants (50
   male and 50 female) evaluated each video according to three categories:
   human action resemblance, performed action, and gender of actor. We
   present the mean scores of each evaluation for each video, and further
   propose a selection of the most suitable videos to be used as human
   point-light action displays and scrambled point-light displays for
   control. Finally, we discuss our findings on the gender attributions of
   the point-light displays.}},

Abstract = {{Humor perception is a ubiquitous phenomenon in human societies. In
   theories of humor perception, three factors, non-seriousness, social
   context, and incongruity, have been implicated in humor. In another
   theory, however, elaboration and reinterpretation of contexts are
   considered to play a role in eliciting humor. Although the neural
   correlates of humor appreciation have been investigated using
   neuroimaging methods, only a few studies have conducted such experiments
   under natural conditions. In the present study, two functional magnetic
   resonance imaging experiments, using a comedy movie as a stimulus, were
   conducted to investigate the neural correlates of humor under natural
   conditions. The subjects' brain activity was measured while watching and
   enjoying a movie. In experiment 1, a parametric analysis showed that the
   medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and hippocampus/amygdala had a positive
   relationship with the subjective rating of funniness. In experiment 2,
   intersubject correlation was analyzed to investigate synchronized
   activity across all participants. Signal synchronization that paralleled
   increased funniness ratings was observed in the MPFC and hippocampus.
   Thus, it appears that both parametric and synchronized activity in the
   MPFC and hippocampus are important during humor appreciation. The
   present study has revealed the brain regions that are predominantly
   involved in humor sensation under natural condition.}},

Abstract = {{Early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) is a severe mental illness associated
   with dysconnectivity that widespread in the brain. However, the
   functional dysconnectivity in EOS are still mixed. Recently, studies
   have identified that functional connectivity (FC) arises from a
   band-limited slow rhythmic mechanism and suggested that the
   dysconnectivity at specific frequency bands may provide more robust
   biomarkers for schizophrenia. The frequency-specific changes of FC
   pattern in EOS remain unclear. To address this issue, resting-state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging data scans from 39 EOS patients
   (drug-naive) and 31 healthy controls (FICs) were used to assess the FC
   density (FCD) across slow-4 (0.027-0.073 Hz) and slow-5 (0.01-0.027 Hz).
   Results revealed that a remarkable difference between the FCD of the two
   bands existed mainly in the default mode network (DMN) and subcortical
   areas. Compared with the HCs, EOS patients showed significantly altered
   FCD involved in audiovisual information processing, sensorimotor system,
   and social cognition. Importantly, a significant frequency-by-group
   interaction was observed in the left precuneus with significantly lower
   FCD in the slow-4 frequency band, but no significant effect in the
   slow-5 frequency band. In addition, decreased FC was found between the
   precuneus and other DMN regions in the slow-4 band. Furthermore, the
   change in FCD in precuneus was inversely proportional to the clinical
   symptom in slow-4 band, indicating the key role of precuneus in
   schizophrenia progress. Our findings demonstrated that the
   dysconnectivity pattern in EOS could be frequency-dependent. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{The relationship between cognitive impairments and social dysfunction in
   schizophrenia is widely accepted. Neuroimaging studies in patients with
   schizophrenia have demonstrated abnormal function in the prefrontal
   region during various neurocognitive tasks. However, studies exploring
   the neural basis of these cognitive impairments are still limited.
   Multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive
   functional neuroimaging technique used to detect the spatiotemporal
   characteristics of brain activity. Previous NIRS studies indicated
   oxy-hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) increase in patients with schizophrenia during
   the verbal fluency task (VFT), but to a lesser extent than in healthy
   participants. Furthermore, aberrant re-increase in the prefrontal region
   was observed during the post-task period. We hypothesized that
   prefrontal/temporal oxy-Hb aberrant re-increase during the post-task
   period was associated with cognitive impairment because oxy-Hb aberrant
   re-increase represent inadequate suppression of neural activity in the
   post-task period.
   We recruited 30 patients with schizophrenia and 30 healthy participants
   in this study. All participants underwent 52-channel NIRS measurement
   using the VFT. The patients with schizophrenia showed oxyHb aberrant
   re-increase in prefrontal and temporal regions during the post-task
   period. Although there was no significant relationship between changes
   in the oxy-Hb during the task and the scores of the Brief Assessment of
   Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS), a significant negative correlation
   was observed between the oxy-Hb during the post-task period and BACS
   working memory z-scores (in DLPFC and temporal regions). These results
   suggest that oxy-Hb re-increase during the post-task period in
   prefrontal and temporal regions is associated with WM deficits in
   patients with schizophrenia and NIRS may be a potential biomarker of
   working memory in chronic schizophrenia. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The valuation of food is a fundamental component of our decision-making.
   Yet little is known about how value signals for food and other rewards
   are constructed by the brain. Using a food-based decision task in human
   participants, we found that subjective values can be predicted from
   beliefs about constituent nutritive attributes of food: protein, fat,
   carbohydrates and vitamin content. Multivariate analyses of functional
   MRI data demonstrated that, while food value is represented in patterns
   of neural activity in both medial and lateral parts of the orbitofrontal
   cortex (OFC), only the lateral OFC represents the elemental nutritive
   attributes. Effective connectivity analyses further indicate that
   information about the nutritive attributes represented in the lateral
   OFC is integrated within the medial OFC to compute an overall value.
   These findings provide a mechanistic account for the construction of
   food value from its constituent nutrients.}},

Abstract = {{The negative impacts of environmental disruption disproportionately
   affect marginalized and underprivileged communities; thus, the degree to
   which society is complicit in allowing unchecked environmental
   destruction to occur has important social justice applications. Although
   decades of research have sought to understand factors which determine
   acceptance of environmental destruction, most of this research has been
   based on self-report surveys. In the present work, we used neuroimaging
   techniques to examine the neural correlates of environmental concern. To
   do this, we compared responses to observing suffering dogs with
   responses to observing suffering ecosystems. Our results extend previous
   findings which had shown largely overlapping neural response patterns to
   observing animal and human suffering. Critically, we found activation in
   regions previously identified as active in empathy processes in response
   to viewing harm to ecosystems (i.e., without any animals present in the
   images). We also found relative differences in response patterns between
   the two types of stimuli: witnessing harm to environments (vs. dog
   suffering) led to reduced activation in some regions, but similar
   activation in others. We discuss these findings in terms of their
   potential implications for behavioral interventions and possibilities
   for continued neuroimaging research examining neural responses to
   environmental ecosystems and other nonhuman entities.}},

Abstract = {{Political polarization at the elite level is a major concern in many
   contemporary democracies, which is argued to alienate large swaths of
   the electorate and prevent meaningful social change from occurring, yet
   little is known about how individuals respond to political candidates
   who deviate from the party line and express policy positions incongruent
   with their party affiliations. This experiment examines the neural
   underpinnings of such evaluations using functional MRI (fMRI). During
   fMRI, participants completed an experimental task where they evaluated
   policy positions attributed to hypothetical political candidates. Each
   block of trials focused on one candidate (Democrat or Republican), but
   all participants saw two candidates from each party in a randomized
   order. On each trial, participants received information about whether
   the candidate supported or opposed a specific policy issue. These issue
   positions varied in terms of congruence between issue position and
   candidate party affiliation. We modeled neural activity as a function of
   incongruence and whether participants were viewing ingroup or outgroup
   party candidates. Results suggest that neural activity in brain regions
   previously implicated in both evaluative processing and work on
   ideological differences (insula and anterior cingulate cortex) differed
   as a function of the interaction between incongruence, candidate type
   (ingroup versus outgroup), and political ideology. More liberal
   participants showed greater activation to incongruent versus congruent
   trials in insula and ACC, primarily when viewing ingroup candidates.
   Implications for the study of democratic representation and linkages
   between citizens' calls for social change and policy implementation are
   discussed.}},

Journal = {{BRAIN AND COGNITION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{119}},
Pages = {{54-63}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Previous neuroscience studies have investigated neural correlates of
   risky decision-making in a single-brain frame during pseudo social
   (predominantly non face-to-face) contexts. To fully understand the risky
   decision making behavior in more natural social interactions, the
   present study employed a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
   hyperscanning technique to simultaneously measure pairs of participants'
   fronto-temporal activations in a face-to-face gambling card-game. The
   intra-brain results revealed that both those who identified as males and
   as females showed higher activations in their mPFC and in the inferior
   parts of the frontopolar area, as well as in the tempo-parietal junction
   (TPJ) in cases involving higher versus lower risk. This is consistent
   with previous findings suggesting importance of the mentalizing network
   in decision tasks. The fNIRS results of inter brain neural
   synchronization (INS) also revealed that males and females showed
   increased inter-brain coherence in the mPFC and dlPFC. Females, however,
   uniquely showed increased inter-brain coherence in the left TPJ. This
   INS result suggests that males may primarily depend on non-social
   cognitive ability to make a risky decision in a social interaction,
   while females may use both social and non-social cognitive abilities.
   The implications are also discussed for general topics of human
   interaction and two-person neuroscience.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies that showed decreased brain activation in people with
   autism spectrum disorder (ASD) viewing expressive faces did not control
   that participants looked in the eyes. This is problematic because ASD is
   characterized by abnormal attention to the eyes. Here, we collected fMRI
   data from 48 participants (27 ASD) viewing pictures of neutral faces and
   faces expressing anger, happiness, and fear at low and high intensity,
   with a fixation cross between the eyes. Group differences in whole brain
   activity were examined for expressive faces at high and low intensity
   versus neutral faces. Group differences in neural activity were also
   investigated in regions of interest within the social brain, including
   the amygdala and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). In response
   to low intensity fearful faces, ASD participants showed increased
   activation in the social brain regions, and decreased functional
   coupling between the amygdala and the vmPFC. This oversensitivity to low
   intensity fear coupled with a lack of emotional regulation capacity
   could indicate an excitatory/inhibitory imbalance in their
   socio-affective processing system. This may result in social
   disengagement and avoidance of eye-contact to handle feelings of strong
   emotional reaction. Our results also demonstrate the importance of
   careful control of gaze when investigating emotional processing in ASD.

Volume = {{38}},

Abstract = {{Interoception has been defined as the sensing of the physiological
   condition of the body, with interoceptive sensibility (IS)
   characterizing an individual's self-reported awareness of internal
   sensation. IS is a multidimensional construct including not only the
   tendency to be aware of sensation but also how sensations are
   interpreted, regulated, and used to inform behavior, with different
   dimensions relating to different aspects of health and disease. Here we
   investigated neural mechanisms of interoception when healthy individuals
   attended to their heartbeat and skin temperature, and examined the
   relationship between neural activity during interoception and individual
   differences in self-reported IS using the Multidimensional Scale of
   Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA). Consistent with prior work,
   interoception activated a network involving insula and sensorimotor
   regions but also including occipital, temporal, and prefrontal cortex.
   Differences based on interoceptive focus (heartbeat vs skin temperature)
   were found in insula, sensorimotor regions, occipital cortex, and limbic
   areas. Factor analysis of MAIA dimensions revealed 3 dissociable
   components of IS in our dataset, only one of which was related to neural
   activity during interoception. Reduced scores on the third factor, which
   reflected reduced ability to control attention to body sensation and
   increased tendency to distract from and worry about aversive sensations,
   was associated with greater activation in many of the same regions as
   those involved in interoception, including insula, sensorimotor,
   anterior cingulate, and temporal cortex. These data suggest that
   self-rated interoceptive sensibility is related to altered activation in
   regions involved in monitoring body state, which has implications for
   disorders associated with abnormality of interoception. (c) 2017 Wiley

Abstract = {{While behavioral research suggests an association between cultural
   worldview and decreased anxiety of death, the underlying neurobiological
   mechanisms remain unclear. Using functional MRI, we investigated whether
   and how the serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR),
   which has been associated with mental disorders such as anxiety and
   depression, moderates the associations between a cultural trait (i.e.,
   interdependence) and self-report of death anxiety/depression and between
   interdependence and brain responses to mortality threats. Long/long and
   short/short allele carriers of the 5-HTTLPR were scanned using fMRI
   while they performed a one-back task on death-related, death-unrelated
   negative, and neutral words. Participants' interdependence and death
   anxiety/depression were assessed using questionnaires after scanning. We
   found that participants who assessed themselves with greater
   interdependence reported lower death anxiety/depression and showed
   decreased neural response to death-related words in emotion-related
   brain regions including the anterior cingulate, putamen, and thalamus.
   However, these results were evident in long/long allele carriers of the
   5-HTTLPR but not in short/short allele carriers who even showed positive
   associations between interdependence and neural activities in the
   anterior cingulate, putamen and thalamus in response to death-related
   words. Our findings suggest candidate mechanisms for explaining the
   complex relationship between genotype, cultural traits, and
   mental/neural responses to mortality threats. (c) 2017 Wiley

Abstract = {{Exposure to acute stress induces multiple emotional responses, each with
   their own unique temporal dynamics. Dynamic functional connectivity
   (dFC) measures the temporal variability of network synchrony and
   captures individual differences in network neurodynamics. This study
   investigated the relationship between dFC and individual differences in
   emotions induced by an acute psychosocial stressor. Sixteen healthy
   adult women underwent fMRI scanning during a social evaluative threat
   (SET) task, and retrospectively completed questionnaires that assessed
   individual differences in subjectively experienced positive and negative
   emotions about stress and stress relief during the task. Group dFC was
   decomposed with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) into 10 components,
   each with a temporal signature, spatial network of functionally
   connected regions, and vector of participant loadings that captures
   individual differences in dFC. Participant loadings of two networks were
   positively correlated with stress-related emotions, indicating the
   existence of networks for positive and negative emotions. The
   emotion-related networks involved the ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
   cingulate cortex, anterior insula, and amygdala, among other distributed
   brain regions, and time signatures for these emotion-related networks
   were uncorrelated. These findings demonstrate that individual
   differences in stress-induced positive and negative emotions are each
   uniquely associated with large-scale brain networks, and suggest that
   dFC is a mechanism that generates individual differences in the
   emotional components of the stress response. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{Pain is a highly salient and attention-demanding experience that
   motivates people to act. We investigated the effect of pain on decision
   making by delivering acute thermal pain to participants' forearm while
   they made risky and intertemporal choices involving money. Participants
   (n = 107) were more risk seeking under pain than in a no-pain control
   condition when decisions involved gains but not when they involved
   equivalent losses. Pain also resulted in greater preference for
   immediate (smaller) over future (larger) monetary rewards. We interpret
   these results as a motivation to offset the aversive, pain-induced
   state, where monetary rewards become more appealing under pain than
   under no pain and when delivered sooner rather than later. Our findings
   add to the long-standing debate regarding the role of intuition and
   reflection in decision making.}},

   from interviews of 15 incident commanders were analyzed for emotional
   and social intelligence competencies in incident management leadership.
   Seven competencies were found to significantly differentiate outstanding
   leaders from average leaders. Emotional self-control, adaptability,
   empathy, coach/mentor, and inspirational leadership significantly or
   near significantly differentiated the outstanding leaders. Five
   additional competencies appeared as threshold competencies: achievement
   orientation, organizational awareness, influence, conflict management,
   and teamwork. Implications for further research, training, and

Abstract = {{The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the association
   between burnout and neural activation during working memory processing
   in patients with stress-related exhaustion. Additionally, we
   investigated the neural effects of cognitive training as part of stress
   rehabilitation. Fifty-five patients with clinical diagnosis of
   exhaustion disorder were administered the n-back task during fMRI
   scanning at baseline. Ten patients completed a 12-week cognitive
   training intervention, as an addition to stress rehabilitation. Eleven
   patients served as a treatment-as-usual control group. At baseline,
   burnout level was positively associated with neural activation in the
   rostral prefrontal cortex, the posterior parietal cortex and the
   striatum, primarily in the 2-back condition. Following stress
   rehabilitation, the striatal activity decreased as a function of
   improved levels of burnout. No significant association between burnout
   level and working memory performance was found, however, our findings
   indicate that frontostriatal neural responses related to working memory
   were modulated by burnout severity. We suggest that patients with high
   levels of burnout need to recruit additional cognitive resources to
   uphold task performance. Following cognitive training, increased neural
   activation was observed during 3-back in working memory-related regions,
   including the striatum, however, low sample size limits any firm
   conclusions.}},

Title = {{Differential Neural Processing of Social Exclusion and Inclusion in
   Adolescents with Non-Suicidal Self-Injury and Young Adults with
   Borderline Personality Disorder}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a symptom of borderline
   personality disorder (BPD). However, NSSI often occurs independently of
   BPD. Altered neural processing of social exclusion has been shown in
   adolescents with NSSI and adults with BPD with additional alterations
   during social inclusion in BPD patients. Aims of this study were to
   investigate differences in neural processing of social inclusion and
   exclusion situations between adolescents with NSSI and young adults with
   BPD and NSSI.
   Methods: Using fMRI, neural processing of positive and negative social
   situations (paradigm: ``Cyberball{''}) was explored. Participants were
   14 adolescents with NSSI, but without BPD (M-age = 15.4; SD = 1.9), 15
   adults with BPD and NSSI (M-aga = 23.3; SD = 4.1), as well as 15 healthy
   adolescents (M-age = 14.5; SD = 1.7), and 16 healthy adults (M-age =
   23.2; SD = 4.4).
   Results: Behavioral results showed enhanced feelings of social exclusion
   in both patient groups as compared to healthy controls but only the NSSI
   group showed enhanced activation during social exclusion versus
   inclusion compared to the other groups. While both NSSI and BPD groups
   showed enhanced activation in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex
   during social exclusion as compared to their age-matched controls,
   enhanced activation during social inclusion as compared to a passive
   watching condition was mainly observed in the BPD group in the
   dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and the anterior insula.
   Discussion: While neural processing of social exclusion was pronounced
   in adolescents with NSSI, BPD patients also showed increased activity in
   a per se positive social situation. These results might point toward a
   higher responsiveness to social exclusion in adolescents with NSSI,
   which might then develop into a generalized increased sensitivity to all
   kinds of social situations in adults with BPD.}},

Title = {{Development of corticostriatal connectivity constrains goal-directed
   behavior during adolescence}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 28}},
Abstract = {{When pursuing high-value goals, mature individuals typically titrate
   cognitive performance according to environmental demands. However, it
   remains unclear whether adolescents similarly integrate value-based
   goals to selectively enhance goal-directed behavior. We used a
   value-contingent cognitive control task during fMRI to assess how
   stakes-the value of a prospective outcome-modulate flexible
   goal-directed behavior and underlying neurocognitive processes. Here we
   demonstrate that while adults enhance performance during high stakes,
   adolescents perform similarly during low and high stakes conditions. The
   developmental emergence of value-contingent performance is mediated by
   connectivity between the striatum and prefrontal cortex; this
   connectivity selectively increases during high stakes and with age.
   These findings suggest that adolescents may not benefit from high stakes
   to the same degree adults do-a behavioral profile that may be
   constrained by ongoing maturation of corticostriatal connectivity. We
   propose that late development of corticostriatal connectivity sets the
   stage for optimal goal-directed behavior.}},

   as assessed by Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies revealed spontaneous neural activity to be associated
   with fluid intelligence (gF) which is commonly assessed by Raven's
   Advanced Progressive Matrices, and embeds two types of reasoning:
   visuospatial and verbal-analytic reasoning. With resting-state fMRI
   data, using global brain connectivity (GBC) analysis which averages
   functional connectivity of a voxel in relation to all other voxels in
   the brain, distinct neural correlates of these two reasoning types were
   found. For visuospatial reasoning, negative correlations were observed
   in both the primary visual cortex (PVC) and the precuneus, and positive
   correlations were observed in the temporal lobe. For verbal-analytic
   reasoning, negative correlations were observed in the right inferior
   frontal gyrus (rIFG), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and
   temporoparietal junction, and positive correlations were observed in the
   angular gyrus. Furthermore, an interaction between GBC value and type of
   reasoning was found in the PVC, rIFG and the temporal lobe. These
   findings suggest that visuospatial reasoning benefits more from
   elaborate perception to stimulus features, whereas verbal-analytic
   reasoning benefits more from feature integration and hypothesis testing.
   In sum, the present study offers, for different types of reasoning in
   gF, first empirical evidence of separate neural substrates in the
   resting brain.}},

Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{Social norms regulate behavior, and changes in norms have a great impact
   on society. In most modern societies, norms change through interpersonal
   communication and persuasive messages found in media. Here, we examined
   the neural basis of persuasion-induced changes in attitude toward and
   away from norms using fMRI. We measured brain activity while human
   participants were exposed to persuasive messages directed toward
   specific norms. Persuasion directed toward social norms specifically
   activated a set of brain regions including temporal poles,
   temporo-parietal junction, and medial prefrontal cortex. Beyond these
   regions, when successful, persuasion away from an accepted norm
   specifically recruited the left middle temporal and supramarginal gyri.
   Furthermore, in combination with data from a separate attitude-rating
   task, we found that left supramarginal gyrus activity represented
   participant attitude toward norms and tracked the persuasion-induced
   attitude changes that were away from agreement.}},

Title = {{Distributed Neural Activity Patterns during Human-to-Human Competition}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Interpersonal interaction is the essence of human social behavior.
   However, conventional neuroimaging techniques have tended to focus on
   social cognition in single individuals rather than on dyads or groups.
   As a result, relatively little is understood about the neural events
   that underlie face-to-face interaction. We resolved some of the
   technical obstacles inherent in studying interaction using a novel
   imaging modality and aimed to identify neural mechanisms engaged both
   within and across brains in an ecologically valid instance of
   interpersonal competition. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy was
   utilized to simultaneously measure hemodynamic signals representing
   neural activity in pairs of subjects playing poker against each other
   (human-human condition) or against computer opponents (human-computer
   condition). Previous fMRI findings concerning single subjects confirm
   that neural areas recruited during social cognition paradigms are
   individually sensitive to human-human and human-computer conditions.
   However, it is not known whether face-to-face interactions between
   opponents can extend these findings. We hypothesize distributed effects
   due to live processing and specific variations in across-brain coherence
   not observable in single-subject paradigms. Angular gyrus (AG), a
   component of the temporal-parietal junction (TPJ) previously found to be
   sensitive to socially relevant cues, was selected as a seed to measure
   within-brain functional connectivity. Increased connectivity was
   confirmed between AG and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   (dlPFC) as well as a complex including the left subcentral area (SCA)
   and somatosensory cortex (SS) during interaction with a human opponent.
   These distributed findings were supported by contrast measures that
   indicated increased activity at the left dlPFC and frontopolar area that
   partially overlapped with the region showing increased functional
   connectivity with AG. Acrossbrain analyses of neural coherence between
   the players revealed synchrony between dlPFC and supramarginal gyrus
   (SMG) and SS in addition to synchrony between AG and the fusiform gyrus
   (FG) and SMG. These findings present the first evidence of a
   frontalparietal neural complex including the TPJ, dlPFC, SCA, SS, and FG
   that is more active during human-to-human social cognition both within
   brains (functional connectivity) and across brains (across-brain
   coherence), supporting a model of functional integration of socially and
   strategically relevant information during live face-to-face competitive
   behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Recent behavioural evidence from second language (L2) learners has
   suggested native-like processing of syntactic structures, such as
   long-distance wh-dependencies in L2. The underlying processes are still
   largely debated, while the available neuroimaging evidence has been
   restricted to native (L1) processing. Here we test highly proficient L2
   learners of English in an fMRI experiment incorporating a sentence
   reading task with long-distance wh-dependencies, including abstract
   syntactic categories (empty traces of wh-movement). Our results suggest
   that long-distance wh-dependencies impose increased working memory (WM)
   demands, compared to control sentences of equal length, demonstrated as
   increased activation of the superior and middle temporal gyri
   bilaterally. Additionally, our results suggest abstract syntactic
   processing by the most immersed L2 learners, manifested as comparable
   left temporal activity for sentences with wh-traces and sentences with
   no wh-movement. These findings are discussed against current theoretical
   proposals about L2 syntactic processing.}},

Title = {{An Evolutionary Game Theory Model of Spontaneous Brain Functioning}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 22}},
Abstract = {{Our brain is a complex system of interconnected regions spontaneously
   organized into distinct networks. The integration of information between
   and within these networks is a continuous process that can be observed
   even when the brain is at rest, i.e. not engaged in any particular task.
   Moreover, such spontaneous dynamics show predictive value over
   individual cognitive profile and constitute a potential marker in
   neurological and psychiatric conditions, making its understanding of
   fundamental importance in modern neuroscience. Here we present a
   theoretical and mathematical model based on an extension of evolutionary
   game theory on networks (EGN), able to capture brain's interregional
   dynamics by balancing emulative and non-emulative attitudes among brain
   regions. This results in the net behavior of nodes composing
   resting-state networks identified using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI), determining their moment-to-moment level of activation
   and inhibition as expressed by positive and negative shifts in BOLD fMRI
   signal. By spontaneously generating low-frequency oscillatory behaviors,
   the EGN model is able to mimic functional connectivity dynamics,
   approximate fMRI time series on the basis of initial subset of available
   data, as well as simulate the impact of network lesions and provide
   evidence of compensation mechanisms across networks. Results suggest
   evolutionary game theory on networks as a new potential framework for
   the understanding of human brain network dynamics.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{The tendency to forgive (TTF) refers to one's global dispositional level
   of forgiveness across situations and relationships. Previous brain
   imaging studies examined activation patterns underlying forgiving
   process, yet the association between individual differences in the TTF
   and spontaneous brain activity at resting-state remains unknown. In this
   study, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was
   used to investigate the correlation between the TTF and spontaneous
   brain activity in a young adult sample. Participants were 178 young
   students (55 men) who completed the TTF scale and underwent a
   resting-state fMRI scan. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to
   assess the association between the regional amplitude of low-frequency
   fluctuations (ALFF) and TTF scores corrected for age and sex. Results
   showed that the ALFF value in the right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex
   (dmPFC), precuneus and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) were negatively
   associated with TTF scores. These findings suggest that the spontaneous
   brain activity of brain regions like the dmPFC, precuneus and IPL which
   are implicated in mentalizing and empathic response are associated with
   individual differences in the TTF.}},

Abstract = {{Inter-brain synchronization during joint actions is a core question in
   social neuroscience, and the differential contribution of intra-and
   inter-brain functional connectivity has yet to be clarified along with
   the role of psychological variables such as perceived self-efficacy. The
   cognitive performance and the neural activation underlying the execution
   of joint actions were recorded by functional Near-Infrared imaging
   during a synchronicity game. An 8-channel array of optodes was
   positioned over the frontal and prefrontal regions. During the task, the
   dyads received reinforcing feedback that was experimentally manipulated
   to induce adoption of common strategies. Intra-and inter-brain
   connectivity indices were computed along with an inter-brain/intra-brain
   connectivity index (ConIndex). Finally, correlation analyses were run to
   assess the relationship between behavioral and physiological levels. The
   results showed that the external feedback could modulate participant
   responses in both behavioral and neural components. After the
   reinforcing manipulation, there were faster response times and increased
   inter-brain connectivity, and ConIndex emerged primarily over the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Additionally, the presence of
   significant correlations between response times and inter-brain
   connectivity revealed that only the ``two-players connection{''} may
   guarantee an efficient performance. The present study provides a
   significant contribution to the identification of intra-and inter-brain
   functional connectivity when social reinforcement is provided.}},

Abstract = {{In line with animal models indicating sexually dimorphic effects of
   oxytocin (OXT) on social-emotional processing, a growing number of
   OXT-administration studies in humans have also reported sex-dependent
   effects during social information processing. To explore whether
   sex-dependent effects already occur during early, subliminal, processing
   stages the present pharmacological fMRI-study combined the
   intranasal-application of either OXT or placebo (n = 86-43 males) with a
   backward-masking emotional face paradigm. Results showed that while OXT
   suppressed inferior frontal gyrus, dorsal anterior cingulate and
   anterior insula responses to threatening face stimuli in men it
   increased them in women. In women increased anterior cingulate
   reactivity during subliminal threat processing was also positively
   associated with trait anxiety. On the network level, sex-dependent
   effects were observed on amygdala, anterior cingulate and inferior
   frontal gyrus functional connectivity that were mainly driven by reduced
   coupling in women following OXT. Our findings demonstrate that OXT
   produces sex-dependent effects even at the early stages of
   social-emotional processing, and suggest that while it attenuates neural
   responses to threatening social stimuli in men it increases them in
   women. Thus in a therapeutic context OXT may potentially produce
   different effects on anxiety disorders in men and women.}},

   Evidence from delay and social discounting}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{162}},
Pages = {{186-198}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Behavioral studies using delay and social discounting as indices of
   self-control and altruism, respectively, have revealed functional
   similarities between farsighted and social decisions. However, neural
   evidence for this functional link is lacking. Twenty-five young adults
   completed a delay and social discounting task during fMRI scanning. A
   spatiotemporal partial least squares analysis revealed that both forms
   of discounting were well characterized by a pattern of brain activity in
   areas comprising frontoparietal control, default, and mesolimbic reward
   networks. Both forms of discounting appear to draw on common
   neurocognitive mechanisms, regardless of whether choices involve
   intertemporal or interpersonal outcomes. We also observed neural
   profiles differentiating between high and low discounters. High
   discounters were well characterized by increased medial temporal lobe
   and limbic activity. In contrast, low discount rates were associated
   with activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and right temporoparietal
   junction. This pattern may reflect biological mechanisms underlying
   behavioral heterogeneity in discount rates.}},

Title = {{Folk-Psychological Interpretation of Human vs. Humanoid Robot Behavior:
   Exploring the Intentional Stance toward Robots}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{People rely on shared folk-psychological theories when judging behavior.
   These theories guide people's social interactions and therefore need to
   be taken into consideration in the design of robots and other autonomous
   systems expected to interact socially with people. It is, however, not
   yet clear to what degree the mechanisms that underlie people's judgments
   of robot behavior overlap or differ from the case of human or animal
   behavior. To explore this issue, participants (N = 90) were exposed to
   images and verbal descriptions of eight different behaviors exhibited
   either by a person or a humanoid robot. Participants were asked to rate
   the intentionality, controllability and desirability of the behaviors,
   and to judge the plausibility of seven different types of explanations
   derived from a recently proposed psychological model of lay causal
   explanation of human behavior. Results indicate: substantially similar
   judgments of human and robot behavior, both in terms of (1a) ascriptions
   of intentionality/controllability/desirability and in terms of (1b)
   plausibility judgments of behavior explanations; (2a) high level of
   agreement in judgments of robot behavior -(2b) slightly lower but still
   largely similar to agreement over human behaviors; (3) systematic
   differences in judgments concerning the plausibility of goals and
   dispositions as explanations of human vs. humanoid behavior. Taken
   together, these results suggest that people's intentional stance toward
   the robot was in this case very similar to their stance toward the
   human.}},

Title = {{The Relationship of Cognitive Performance and the Theta-Alpha Power
   Ratio Is Age-Dependent: An EEG Study of Short Term Memory and Reasoning
   during Task and Resting-State in Healthy Young and Old Adults}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The Theta-Alpha ratio (TAR) is known to differ based upon age
   and cognitive ability, with pathological electroencephalography (EEG)
   patterns routinely found within neurodegenerative disorders of older
   adults. We hypothesized that cognitive ability would predict EEG metrics
   differently within healthy young and old adults, and that healthy old
   adults not showing age-expected EEG activity may be more likely to
   demonstrate cognitive deficits relative to old adults showing these
   expected changes.
   Methods: In 216 EEG blocks collected in 16 young and 20 old adults
   during rest (eyes open, eyes closed) and cognitive tasks (short-term
   memory {[}STM]; matrix reasoning {[}RM; Raven's matrices1), models
   assessed the contributing roles of cognitive ability, age, and task in
   predicting the TAR. A general linear mixed-effects regression model was
   used to model this relationship, including interaction effects to test
   whether increased cognitive ability predicted TAR differently for young
   and old adults at rest and during cognitive tasks.
   Results: The relationship between cognitive ability and the TAR across
   all blocks showed age-dependency, and cognitive performance at the CZ
   midline location predicted the TAR measure when accounting for the
   effect of age (p < 0.05, chi-square test of nested models). Age
   significantly interacted with STM performance in predicting the TAR (p <
   0.05); increases in STM were associated with increased TAR in young
   adults, but not in old adults. RM showed similar interaction effects
   with aging and TAR (p < 0.10).
   Conclusion: EEG correlates of cognitive ability are age-dependent.
   Adults who did not show age-related EEG changes were more likely to
   exhibit cognitive deficits than those who showed age-related changes.
   This suggests that healthy aging should produce moderate changes in
   Alpha and TAR measures, and the absence of such changes signals impaired
   cognitive functioning.}},

Title = {{The Functional Architecture of the Brain Underlies Strategic Deception
   in Impression Management}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Impression management, as one of the most essential skills of social
   function, impacts one's survival and success in human societies.
   However, the neural architecture underpinning this social skill remains
   poorly understood. By employing a two-person bargaining game, we exposed
   three strategies involving distinct cognitive processes for social
   impression management with different levels of strategic deception. We
   utilized a novel adaptation of Granger causality accounting for
   signal-dependent noise (SDN), which captured the directional
   connectivity underlying the impression management during the bargaining
   game. We found that the sophisticated strategists engaged stronger
   directional connectivity from both dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and
   retrosplenial cortex to rostral prefrontal cortex, and the strengths of
   these directional influences were associated with higher level of
   deception during the game. Using the directional connectivity as a
   neural signature, we identified the strategic deception with 80\%
   accuracy by a machine-learning classifier. These results suggest that
   different social strategies are supported by distinct patterns of
   directional connectivity among key brain regions for social cognition.}},

Pages = {{83-89}},

Abstract = {{Hands, much like faces, convey social information, instructions and
   intentions to an observer. While the neural processes of face perception
   have been widely studied, it was only recently that fMRI identified
   occipito-temporal areas sensitive to static images of hands as body
   parts. To complement these studies with fine-grained timing information,
   we measured event-related EEG potentials (ERPs) from 33 subjects who
   were presented with static images of hands versus faces, whole bodies,
   and inanimate objects as controls. Already at N1 latency, similar to 170
   ms, hand-related ERP patterns were manifest in two results: (1)
   significant differences in amplitudes for images of hands versus bodies
   in occipito-temporal N1 responses; (2) left lateralization of responses
   to images of hands, and also of the difference waveforms (hands minus
   bodies), quantifying hand-related responses. In line with fMRI studies
   of hand sensitive areas distinct from extrastriate body area (EBA), the
   current findings provide electrophysiological evidence for
   hand-sensitive brain activation, occurring at a similarly early latency
   as N1 responses to faces.}},

Abstract = {{Group biases guide social interactions by promoting in-group
   favouritism, but the neural mechanisms underpinning group biases remain
   unclear. While neuroscience research has shown that distributed brain
   circuits are associated with seeing in-group and out-group members as
   ``us{''} and ``them{''}, it is less clear how these networks exchange
   signals. This fMRI study uses functional connectivity analyses to
   investigate the contribution of functional integration to group bias
   modulation of person perception. Participants were assigned to an
   arbitrary group and during scanning they observed bodies of in-group or
   out-group members that cued the recall of positive or negative social
   knowledge. The results showed that functional coupling between
   perceptual and cognitive neural networks is tuned to particular
   combinations of group membership and social knowledge valence.
   Specifically, coupling between body perception and theory-of-mind
   networks is biased towards seeing a person that had previously been
   paired with information consistent with group bias (positive for
   in-group and negative for out-group). This demonstrates how brain
   regions associated with visual analysis of others and belief reasoning
   exchange and integrate signals when evaluating in-group and out-group
   members. The results update models of person perception by showing how
   and when interplay occurs between perceptual and extended systems when
   developing a representation of another person.}},

Abstract = {{Mere affiliation with a social group alters people's perception of other
   individuals. One suggested mechanism behind such influence is that group
   membership triggers divergent visual facial representations for in-group
   and out-group members, which could constrain face processing. Here,
   using electroencephalography (EEG) under functional magnetic resonance
   imagery (fMRI) during a group categorization task, we investigated the
   impact of mere affiliation to an arbitrary group on the processing of
   emotional faces. The results indicate that in-and out-group members
   trigger differential event-related potential activity, appearing 150 ms
   after presentation of group membership information, which correlated
   with medial prefrontal fMRI activity. Additionally, EEG activity in the
   earliest stages of face processing (30-100 ms after expression onset)
   dissociated unexpected group-related emotions (in-group anger and
   out-group joy) from expected ones and correlated with temporo-parietal
   junction fMRI activity. We discuss the possibility that such
   dissociation may result from top-down influences from divergent
   representations for in-group and outgroup members. Taken together, the
   present results suggest that mere membership in an arbitrary group
   polarized expectations which constrain the first steps of face
   processing.}},

Title = {{Multivariate pattern dependence}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{When we perform a cognitive task, multiple brain regions are engaged.
   Understanding how these regions interact is a fundamental step to
   uncover the neural bases of behavior. Most research on the interactions
   between brain regions has focused on the univariate responses in the
   regions. However, fine grained patterns of response encode important
   information, as shown by multivariate pattern analysis. In the present
   article, we introduce and apply multivariate pattern dependence (MVPD):
   a technique to study the statistical dependence between brain regions in
   humans in terms of the multivariate relations between their patterns of
   responses. MVPD characterizes the responses in each brain region as
   trajectories in region-specific multidimensional spaces, and models the
   multivariate relationship between these trajectories. We applied MVPD to
   the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and to the fusiform face
   area (FFA), using a searchlight approach to reveal interactions between
   these seed regions and the rest of the brain. Across two different
   experiments, MVPD identified significant statistical dependence not
   detected by standard functional connectivity. Additionally, MVPD
   outperformed univariate connectivity in its ability to explain
   independent variance in the responses of individual voxels. In the end,
   MVPD uncovered different connectivity profiles associated with different
   representational subspaces of FFA: the first principal component of FFA
   shows differential connectivity with occipital and parietal regions
   implicated in the processing of low-level properties of faces, while the
   second and third components show differential connectivity with anterior
   temporal regions implicated in the processing of invariant
   representations of face identity.}},

Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{In non-human animal research, studies comparing socially monogamous and
   promiscuous species of voles (Microtus) have identified some key neural
   differences related to monogamy and non-monogamy. Specifically,
   densities of the vasopressin V1a receptor and dopamine D2 receptors in
   subcortical reward-related and limbic areas of the brain have been
   linked to monogamous behavior in prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster).
   Similar brain areas have been shown to be correlated with feelings of
   romantic love in monogamously pair-bonded humans. Humans vary in the
   degree to which they engage in (non-)monogamous behaviors. The present
   study examined the differences in neural activation in response to
   sexual and romantic stimuli in monogamous (n = 10) and non-monogamous (n
   = 10) men. Results indicated that monogamous men showed more
   reward-related neural activity when viewing romantic pictures compared
   to non-monogamous men. Areas with increased activation for monogamous
   men were all in the right hemisphere and included the thalamus,
   accumbens, striatum, pallidum, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex. There
   were no significant differences between groups in activation to sexual
   stimuli. These results demonstrate that the neural processing of
   romantic images is different for monogamous and non-monogamous men.
   There is some overlap in the neural areas showing increased activation
   in monogamous men in the present study and the neural areas that show
   differences in the vole models of monogamy and affiliation. Future
   research will be needed to clarify whether similar factors are
   contributing to the neural differences seen in monogamous and
   non-monogamous humans and voles.}},

Title = {{Object words modulate the activity of the mirror neuron system during
   action imitation}},
Journal = {{BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundAlthough research has demonstrated that the mirror neuron
   system (MNS) plays a crucial role in both action imitation and
   action-related semantic processing, whether action-related words can
   inversely modulate the MNS activity remains unclear.
   MethodsHere, three types of task-irrelevant words (body parts, verbs,
   and manufactured objects) were presented to examine the modulation
   effect of these words on the MNS activity during action observation and
   imitation. Twenty-two participants were recruited for the fMRI scanning
   and remaining data from 19 subjects were reported here.
   ResultsBrain activity results showed that word types elicited different
   modulation effects over nodes of the MNS (i.e., the right inferior
   frontal gyrus, premotor cortex, inferior parietal lobule, and STS),
   especially during the imitation stage. Compared with other word
   conditions, action imitation following manufactured objects words
   induced stronger activation in these brain regions during the imitation
   stage. These results were consistent in both task-dependent and
   -independent ROI analysis.
   ConclusionOur findings thus provide evidence for the unique effect of
   object words on the MNS during imitation of action, which may also
   confirm the key role of goal inference in action imitation.}},

Abstract = {{Obesity is fundamentally a disorder of energy balance. In obese
   individuals, more energy is consumed than is expended, leading to
   excessive weight gain through the accumulation of adipose tissue.
   Complications arising from obesity, including cardiovascular disease,
   elevated peripheral inflammation, and the development of Type II
   diabetes, make obesity one of the leading preventable causes of
   morbidity and mortality. Thus, it is of paramount importance to both
   individual and public health that we understand the neural circuitry
   underlying the behavioral regulation of energy balance. To this end, we
   sought to examine obesity-related differences in the resting state
   functional connectivity of the dorsal mid-insula, a region of gustatory
   and interoceptive cortex associated with homeostatically sensitive
   responses to food stimuli. Within the present study, obese and healthy
   weight individuals completed resting fMRI scans during varying
   interoceptive states, both while fasting and after a standardized meal.
   We examined group differences in the pre- versus post-meal functional
   connectivity of the mid-insula, and how those differences were related
   to differences in self-reported hunger ratings and ratings of meal
   pleasantness. Obese and healthy weight individuals exhibited opposing
   patterns of eating-related functional connectivity between the dorsal
   mid-insula and multiple brain regions involved in reward, valuation, and
   satiety, including the medial orbitofrontal cortex, the dorsal striatum,
   and the ventral striatum. In particular, healthy weight participants
   exhibited a significant positive relationship between changes in hunger
   and changes in medial orbitofrontal functional connectivity, while obese
   participants exhibited a complementary negative relationship between
   hunger and ventral striatum connectivity to the mid-insula. These
   obesity-related alterations in dorsal mid-insula functional connectivity
   patterns may signify a fundamental difference in the experience of food
   motivation in obese individuals, wherein approach behavior toward food
   is guided more by reward-seeking than by homeostatically relevant
   interoceptive information from the body.}},

Abstract = {{Empathy, the ability to understand others' emotions, can occur through
   perspective taking and experience sharing. Neural systems active when
   adults empathize include regions underlying perspective taking (e.g.
   medial prefrontal cortex; MPFC) and experience sharing (e.g. inferior
   parietal lobule; IPL). It is unknown whether adolescents utilize
   networks implicated in both experience sharing and perspective taking
   when accurately empathizing. This question is critical given the
   importance of accurately understanding others' emotions for developing
   and maintaining adaptive peer relationships during adolescence. We
   extend the literature on empathy in adolescence by determining the
   neural basis of empathic accuracy, a behavioral assay of empathy that
   does not bias participants toward the exclusive use of perspective
   taking or experience sharing. Participants (N = 155, aged 11.1-15.5
   years) watched videos of `targets' describing emotional events and
   continuously rated the targets' emotions during functional magnetic
   resonance imaging scanning. Empathic accuracy related to activation in
   regions underlying perspective taking (MPFC, temporoparietal junction
   and superior temporal sulcus), while activation in regions underlying
   experience sharing (IPL, anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula)
   related to lower empathic accuracy. These results provide novel insight
   into the neural basis of empathic accuracy in adolescence and suggest
   that perspective taking processes may be effective for increasing
   empathy.}},

Abstract = {{Social neuroscience uses increasingly complex paradigms to improve
   ecological validity, as investigating aggressive interactions with
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Standard analyses for fMRI
   data typically use general linear models (GLM), which require a priori
   models of task effects on neural processes. These may inadequately model
   non-stimulus-locked or temporally overlapping cognitive processes, as
   mentalizing about other agents. We used the data-driven approach of
   independent component analysis (ICA) to investigate neural processes
   involved in a competitive interaction. Participants were confronted with
   an angry-looking opponent while having to anticipate the trial outcome
   and the opponent's behaviour. We show that several spatially distinctive
   neural networks with associated temporal dynamics were modulated by the
   opponent's facial expression. These results dovetail and extend the main
   effects observed in the GLM analysis of the same data. Additionally, the
   ICA approach identified effects of the experimental condition on neural
   systems during inter-trial intervals. We demonstrate that cognitive
   processes during aggressive interactions are poorly modelled by simple
   stimulus onset/duration variables and instead have more complex temporal
   dynamics. This highlights the utility of using data-driven analyses to
   elucidate the distinct cognitive processes recruited during complex
   social paradigms.}},

Abstract = {{Fear generalization is a prominent feature of anxiety disorders and
   post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is defined as enhanced fear
   responding to a stimulus that bears similarities, but is not identical
   to a threatening stimulus. Pattern separation, a hippocampal-dependent
   process, is critical for stimulus discrimination; it transforms similar
   experiences or events into non-overlapping representations. This study
   is the first in humans to investigate the extent to which fear
   generalization relies on behavioral pattern separation abilities.
   Participants (N = 46) completed a behavioral task taxing pattern
   separation, and a neuroimaging fear conditioning and generalization
   paradigm. Results show an association between lower behavioral pattern
   separation performance and increased generalization in shock expectancy
   scores, but not in fear ratings. Furthermore, lower behavioral pattern
   separation was associated with diminished recruitment of the subcallosal
   cortex during presentation of generalization stimuli. This region showed
   functional connectivity with the orbitofrontal cortex and ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex. Together, the data provide novel experimental
   evidence that pattern separation is related to generalization of threat
   expectancies, and reduced fear inhibition processes in frontal regions.
   Deficient pattern separation may be critical in overgeneralization and
   therefore may contribute to the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders and
   PTSD.}},

Abstract = {{Sustained anticipatory anxiety is central to Generalized Anxiety
   Disorder (GAD). During anticipatory anxiety, phasic threat responding
   appears to be mediated by the amygdala, while sustained threat
   responding seems related to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis
   (BNST). Although sustained anticipatory anxiety in GAD patients was
   proposed to be associated with BNST activity alterations, firm evidence
   is lacking. We aimed to explore temporal characteristics of BNST and
   amygdala activity during threat anticipation in GAD patients. Nineteen
   GAD patients and nineteen healthy controls (HC) underwent functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a temporally unpredictable
   threat anticipation paradigm. We defined phasic and a systematic
   variation of sustained response models for blood oxygen level-dependent
   responses during threat anticipation, to disentangle temporally
   dissociable involvement of the BNST and the amygdala. GAD patients
   relative to HC responded with increased phasic amygdala activity to
   onset of threat anticipation and with elevated sustained BNST activity
   that was delayed relative to the onset of threat anticipation. Both the
   amygdala and the BNST displayed altered responses during threat
   anticipation in GAD patients, albeit with different time courses. The
   results for the BNST activation hint towards its role in sustained
   threat responding, and contribute to a deeper understanding of
   pathological sustained anticipatory anxiety in GAD.}},

Abstract = {{Rumination and cognitive reactivity (dysfunctional cognitions after sad
   mood-induction) remain high in remitted Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)
   and can contribute to new episodes. These factors have been linked to
   increased fMRI resting-state functional-connectivity within the
   Default-Mode Network (DMN). It remains unclear whether (I) increased
   DMN-connectivity persists during MDD-remission, and (II) whether sad
   mood-induction differentially affects DMN-connectivity in remitted-MDD
   vs controls. Moreover, DMN-connectivity studies in remitted-MDD were
   previously confounded by antidepressant-use. Sixty-two MDD-patients
   remitted from a parts per thousand<yen>2 episodes,
   psychotropic-medication free, and 41 controls, participated in two 5-min
   neutral and sad mood-inductions by autobiographical-recall and
   neutral/sad music, each followed by 8-min resting-state fMRI-scanning.
   We identified DMN-components using Independent Component Analysis and
   entered subject- and sessions-specific components into a repeated
   measures analysis of variance. Connectivity-differences were extracted
   and correlated with baseline cognitive reactivity and rumination as
   measures of vulnerability for recurrence. After sad vs neutral
   mood-induction, controls, but not remitted-MDD, showed an increase in
   connectivity between the posterior-DMN and a cluster consisting mostly
   of the hippocampus (P = 0.006). Less posterior-DMN-hippocampal
   connectivity was associated with higher cognitive reactivity (r = -0.21,
   P = 0.046) and rumination (r = -0.27, P = 0.017). After recalling sad
   autobiographical-memories, aberrant posterior-DMN-hippocampal
   connectivity, associated with cognitive reactivity and rumination,
   remains a neural vulnerability in MDD-remission.}},

Abstract = {{The right posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is implicated in spatial
   attention, but its specific role in emotional spatial attention remains
   unclear. In this study, we combined inhibitory transcranial magnetic
   stimulation (TMS) with a fear-conditioning paradigm to test the role of
   the right PPC in attentional control of task-irrelevant threatening
   distractors. In a sham-controlled within-subject design, 1-Hz repetitive
   TMS was applied to the left and right PPC after which participants
   performed a visual search task with a distractor that was either
   associated with a loud noise burst (threat) or not (non-threat). Results
   demonstrated attentional capture across all conditions as evidenced by
   the typical reaction time costs of the distractor. However, only after
   inhibitory rTMS to the right PPC reaction time cost in the threatening
   distractor condition was increased relative to the non-threatening
   distractor condition, suggesting that attention lingered longer on the
   threatening distractor. We propose that the right PPC is involved in
   disengagement of attention from emotionally salient stimuli in order to
   re-orient attention to task relevant stimuli and may have implications
   for anxiety disorders associated with difficulties to disengage from
   threatening stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{The human capacity to reason about others' minds includes making causal
   inferences about intentions, beliefs, values, and goals. Previous fMRI
   research has suggested that a network of brain regions, including
   bilateral temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), superior temporal sulcus
   (STS), and medial prefrontal-cortex (MPFC), are reliably recruited for
   mental state reasoning. Here, in two fMRI experiments, we investigate
   the representational content of these regions. Building on existing
   computational and neural evidence, we hypothesized that social brain
   regions contain at least two functionally and spatially distinct
   components: one that represents information related to others'
   motivations and values, and another that represents information about
   others' beliefs and knowledge. Using multi-voxel pattern analysis, we
   find evidence that motivational versus epistemic features are
   independently represented by theory of mind (ToM) regions: RTPJ contains
   information about the justification of the belief, bilateral TPJ
   represents the modality of the source of knowledge, and VMPFC represents
   the valence of the resulting emotion. These representations are found
   only in regions implicated in social cognition and predict behavioral
   responses at the level of single items. We argue that cortical regions
   implicated in mental state inference contain complementary, but
   distinct, representations of epistemic and motivational features of
   others' beliefs, and that, mirroring the processes observed in sensory
   systems, social stimuli are represented in distinct and distributed
   formats across the human brain.}},

Abstract = {{Schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are two prevalent
   neurodevelopmental disorders sharing some similar genetic basis and
   clinical features. The extent to which they share common neural
   substrates remains unclear. Resting-state fMRI data were collected from
   35 drug-naive adolescent participants with first-episode schizophrenia
   (15.61.8 years old) and 31 healthy controls (15.4 +/- 1.6 years old).
   Data from 22 participants with ASD (13.1 +/- 3.1 years old) and 21
   healthy controls (12.9 +/- 2.9 years old) were downloaded from the
   Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange. Resting-state functional networks
   were constructed using predefined regions of interest. Multivariate
   pattern analysis combined with multi-task regression feature selection
   methods were conducted in two datasets separately. Classification
   between individuals with disorders and controls was achieved with high
   accuracy (schizophrenia dataset: accuracy=83\%; ASD dataset:
   accuracy=80\%). Shared atypical brain connections contributing to
   classification were mostly present in the default mode network (DMN) and
   salience network (SN). These functional connections were further related
   to severity of social deficits in ASD (p=0.002). Distinct atypical
   connections were also more related to the DMN and SN, but showed
   different atypical connectivity patterns between the two disorders.
   These results suggest some common neural mechanisms contributing to
   schizophrenia and ASD, and may aid in understanding the pathology of
   these two neurodevelopmental disorders. Autism Res2017, 10: 1776-1786.

Abstract = {{Adolescence is an important time for social development during which

   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study we tested how outcomes for

   Participants between 8 and 27years of age were tested twice with a
   2-year difference between the first (N=299) and second (N=254) time
   points. Participants performed a task in which they could win and lose

   a linear decrease in activity in social brain regions for friend>self
   over development. These results confirm changes in the social brain
   network across adolescent development, we further show that individual
   differences are related to these neural changes.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectivesTo explore whether facial emotion recognition (FER), impaired
   in both schizophrenia and alcohol and substance use disorders
   (AUDs/SUDs), is additionally compromised among comorbid subjects, also
   considering the role of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met.
   MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study, randomly recruiting 67
   subjects with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of schizophrenia, and rigorously
   assessing AUDs/SUDs and COMT Val158Met polymorphism. FER was assessed
   using the Ekman 60 Faces Test- EK-60F.
   ResultsAs a whole, the sample scored significantly lower than normative
   data on EK-60F. However, subjects with comorbid AUDs/SUDs did not
   perform worse on EK-60F than those without, who had a better performance
   on EK-60F if they carried the COMT Val/Met variant.
   ConclusionsThis study is the first to date examining the impact of
   AUDs/SUDs and COMT variants on FER in an epidemiologically
   representative sample of subjects with schizophrenia. Our findings do
   not suggest an additional impairment from comorbid AUDs/SUDs on FER
   among subjects with schizophrenia, whilst COMT Val158Met, though based
   on a limited sample, might have a role just among those without
   AUDs/SUDs. Based on our results, additional research is needed also
   exploring differential roles of various substances.}},

Volume = {{118}},
Pages = {{45-53}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Behavioral studies showed that self-concept can be distinguished into
   different domains, but few neuroimaging studies have investigated either
   domain-specific or valence-specific activity. Here, we investigated
   whether evaluating self-and mother-traits in three domains (physical,
   academic, prosocial) relies on similar or distinct brain regions.
   Additionally, we explored the topical discussion in the literature on
   whether vmPFC activity during self-evaluations is induced by valence or
   importance of traits. Participants evaluated themselves and their
   mothers on positive and negative traits in three domains. Across all
   domains, evaluating traits resulted in right d1PFC, left middle temporal
   cortex, bilateral thalamus, and right insula activity. For physical
   traits, we found specific neural activity in brain regions typically
   implicated in mentalizing (dmPFC, IPL). For academic traits, we found a
   brain region typically implicated in autobiographical memories (PCC),
   and for prosocial traits, social brain regions (temporal pole, TPJ) were
   activated. Importantly, these patterns were found for both self and
   mother evaluations. Regarding valence, rACC/vmPFC showed stronger
   activation for positive than for negative traits. Interestingly,
   activation in this region was stronger for highly important traits
   compared to low/neutral important traits. Thus, this study shows that
   distinct neural processes are activated for evaluating positive and
   negative traits in different domains.}},

Abstract = {{In this fMRI study we evaluated whether the auditory processing of
   action verbs pronounced by a human or a robotic voice in the imperative
   mood differently modulates the activation of the mirror neuron system
   (MNs). The study produced three results. First, the activation pattern
   found during listening to action verbs was very similar in both the
   robot and human conditions. Second, the processing of action verbs
   compared to abstract verbs determined the activation of the
   fronto-parietal circuit classically involved during the action goal
   understanding. Third, and most importantly, listening to action verbs
   compared to abstract verbs produced activation of the anterior part of
   the supramarginal gyros (aSMG) regardless of the condition (human and
   robot) and in the absence of any object name. The supramarginal gyros is
   a region considered to underpin hand -object interaction and associated
   to the processing of affordances. These results suggest that listening
   to action verbs may trigger the recruitment of motor representations
   characterizing affordances and action execution, coherently with the
   predictive nature of motor simulation that not only allows us to
   re-enact motor knowledge to understand others' actions but also prepares
   us for the actions we might need to carry out.}},

Abstract = {{Early second language (L2) experience influences the neural organization
   of L2 in neuro-plastic terms. Previous studies tried to reveal these
   plastic effects of age of second language acquisition (AoA-L2) and
   proficiency-level in L2 (PL-L2) on the neural basis of language
   processing in bilinguals. Although different activation patterns have
   been observed during language processing in early and late bilinguals by
   taskf-MRI, few studies reported the effect of AoA-L2 and high PL-L2 on
   language network at resting state. In this study, we acquired
   resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) data from 10 Cantonese (L1)-Mandarin (L2)
   early bilinguals (acquired L2: 3 years old) and 11 late bilinguals
   (acquired L2: 6 years old), and analyzed their topological properties of
   language networks after controlling the language daily exposure and
   usage as well as PL in LI and L2. We found that early bilinguals had
   significantly a higher clustering coefficient, global and local
   efficiency, but significantly lower characteristic path length compared
   to late bilinguals. Modular analysis indicated that compared to late
   bilinguals, early bilinguals showed significantly stronger intra-modular
   functional connectivity in the semantic and phonetic modules, stronger
   inter-modular functional connectivity between the semantic and phonetic
   modules as well as between the phonetic and syntactic modules.
   Differences in global and local parameters may reflect different
   patterns of neuroplasticity respectively for early and late bilinguals.
   These results suggested that different L2 experience influences
   topological properties of language network, even if late bilinguals
   achieve high PL-L2. Our findings may provide a new perspective of neural
   mechanisms related to early and late bilinguals. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Mental and neural representations of words are at the core of
   understanding the cognitive and neural mechanisms of reading. Despite
   extensive studies, the nature of visual word representation remains
   highly controversial due to methodological limitations. In particular,
   it is unclear whether the fusiform cortex contains only abstract
   orthographic representation, or represents both lower and higher level
   orthography as well as phonology. Using representational similarity
   analysis, we integrated behavioral ratings, computational models of
   reading and visual object recognition, and neuroimaging data to examine
   the nature of visual word representations in the fusiform cortex. Our
   results provided clear evidence that the middle and anterior fusiform
   represented both phonological and orthographic information. Whereas
   lower level orthographic information was represented at every stage of
   the ventral visual stream, abstract orthographic information was
   increasingly represented along the posterior-to-anterior axis.
   Furthermore, the left and right hemispheres were tuned to high-and
   low-frequency orthographic information, respectively. These results help
   to resolve the longstanding debates regarding the role of the fusiform
   in reading, and have significant implications for the development of
   psychological, neural, and computational theories of reading.}},

Abstract = {{Body motion delivers a wealth of socially relevant information. Yet
   display inversion severely impedes biological motion (BM) processing. It
   is largely unknown how the brain circuits for BM are affected by display
   inversion. As upright and upside-down point-light BM displays are
   similar, we addressed this issue by using ultrahigh field functional MRI
   at 9.4 T providing for high sensitivity and spatial resolution.
   Whole-brain analysis along with exploration of the temporal dynamics of
   the blood-oxygen-level-dependent response reveals that in the left
   hemisphere, inverted BM activates anterior networks likely engaged in
   decision making and cognitive control, whereas readily recognizable
   upright BM activates posterior areas solely. In the right hemisphere,
   multiple networks are activated in response to upright BM as compared
   with scarce activation to inversion. With identical visual input with
   display inversion, a large-scale network in the right hemisphere is
   detected in perceivers who do not constantly interpret displays as shown
   the ``wrong way up.{''} For the first time, we uncover (1) (multi)
   functional involvement of each region in the networks underpinning BM
   processing and (2) large-scale ensembles of regions playing in unison
   with distinct temporal dynamics. The outcome sheds light on the neural
   circuits underlying BM processing as an essential part of the social
   brain.}},

Abstract = {{We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the
   neural basis of human female mate copying. Consistent with previous mate
   copying effects, women's attractiveness ratings for target males
   increased significantly greater after the males were observed paired
   with romantic partners versus ordinary friends, and this was mainly
   accounted for by males being paired with attractive romantic partners.
   Attractiveness ratings for male targets were lower when they were paired
   with an attractive opposite-sex friend. The fMRI data showed that the
   observational learning process in mate copying recruited brain regions
   including the putamen, the inferior frontal gyrus, the middle cingulate,
   the SMA, the insula, and the thalamus - areas overlapped with brain
   regions involved in empathy. The blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD)
   signals in higher cognitive functions including the parieto-frontal
   network, as well as visual areas, were significantly more activated when
   women evaluated males in the friend versus romantic-partner context,
   whereas brain regions were not more active in the reverse comparison,
   suggesting that less cognitive functions or as least no more functions
   were involved in evaluating the quality of target males in the
   romantic-partner context than in the friend context Further analysis
   indicated that specific brain regions related to the evaluation process
   of mate copying were associated with bilateral fusiform gyrus (FFA).
   Thus, results are consistent with a view that mate copying is a
   domain-specific adaptation involving an empathy-based social-learning
   process that is also associated with reduced cognition. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Deception is a universal phenomenon in human society and plays an
   important role in everyday life. Previous studies have revealed that
   people might have an internalized moral norm of keeping honest and the
   deceptive behavior was reliably correlated with activation in executive
   brain regions of prefrontal cortices to over-ride intuitive honest
   responses. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, this study
   sought to investigate how financial position modulated the neural
   responses during deceptive decision. Twenty-one participants were
   scanned when they played a series of adapted Dictator Game with
   different partners after a ball-guess game. Specifically, participants
   gained or lost money in the ball-guess game, and had opportunities to
   get more financial gains through cheating in the following adapted
   Dictator Game. Behavioral results indicated that participants did not
   cheat to the full extent; instead they were more likely to lie after
   losing money compared with gaining money. At the neural level, weaker
   activities in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortices were observed when
   participants lied after losing money than gaining money. Together, our
   data indicated that, people really had an internalized norm of keeping
   honest, but it would be lenient when people feel financial deprivation.
   And suppressing the truthful response originating from moral norm of
   keeping honest was associated with increased level of activation in the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, but this association became weaker
   when people were under financial deprivation.}},

Abstract = {{Human altruistic behaviors are heterogeneous across both contexts and
   people, whereas the neural signatures underlying the heterogeneity
   remain to be elucidated. To address this issue, we examined the neural
   signatures underlying the context- and person-dependent altruistic
   punishment, conjoining event-related fMRI with both task-based and
   resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). Acting as an impartial
   third party, participants decided how to punish norm violators either
   alone or in the presence of putative others. We found that the presence
   of others decreased altruistic punishment due to diffusion of
   responsibility. Those behavioral effects paralleled altered neural
   responses in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and putamen.
   Further, we identified modulation of responsibility diffusion on
   task-based functional connectivity of dACC with the brain regions
   implicated in reward processing (i.e., posterior cingulate cortex and
   amygdala/orbital frontal cortex). Finally, the RSFC results revealed
   that (i) increased intrinsic connectivity strengths of the putamen with
   temporoparietal junction and dorsolateral PFC were associated with
   attenuated responsibility diffusion in altruistic punishment and (ii)
   increased putamen-dorsomedial PFC connectivity strengths were associated
   with reduced responsibility diffusion in self-reported responsibility.
   Taken together, our findings elucidate the context- and person-dependent
   altruistic behaviors as well as associated neural substrates and thus
   provide a potential neurocognitive mechanism of heterogeneous human
   altruistic behaviors. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Studies indicate that both explicit and implicit processing of
   affectively charged stimuli may be reflected in specific behavioural
   markers and physiological signatures. Here, we investigated whether the
   pleasantness ratings of a neutral target were affected by the subliminal
   perception of a painful (a slap) or pleasant (a caress) touch delivered
   to others. In particular, we combined the continuous flash suppression
   technique with the affective misattribution procedure to explore
   subliminal processing of observed pain and pleasure in others. Results
   show that participants rated the neutral target as more or less likeable
   depending on whether they were subliminally primed with the pleasant or
   painful facial expression, respectively. The fMRI activity associated
   with painful and pleasant subliminal priming was mainly present in the
   anterior prefrontal cortex and the primary sensorimotor cortex,
   respectively. Thus, our study provides behavioural and
   neuro-physiological evidence that: (i) emotional reactivity toward
   positive or negative states of others can occur at an entirely
   subliminal level; (ii) specific neural substrates underpin reactivity to
   positive- and negative-valence of social emotions. (C) 2017 Wiley

Abstract = {{Standardized psychometric tests are sophisticated, well-developed, and
   consequential instruments; test outcomes are taken as facts about people
   that impact their lives in important ways. As part of an initial
   demonstration that human brain mapping techniques can add converging
   neural-level evidence to understanding standardized tests, our
   participants completed items from standardized tests during an fMRI
   scan. We compared tests for diagnosing posttraumatic stress disorder
   (PTSD) and the correlated measures of Neuroticism, Attachment, and
   Centrality of Event to a general-knowledge baseline test. Twenty-three
   trauma-exposed participants answered 20 items for each of our five tests
   in each of the three runs for a total of 60 items per test. The tests
   engaged different neural processes; which test a participant was taking
   was accurately predicted from other participants' brain activity. The
   novelty of the application precluded specific anatomical predictions;
   however, the interpretation of activated regions using meta-analyses
   produced encouraging results. For instance, items on the Attachment test
   engaged regions shown to be more active for tasks involving judgments of
   others than judgments of the self. The results are an initial
   demonstration of a theoretically and practically important test-taking
   neuroimaging paradigm and suggest specific neural processes in answering
   PTSD-related tests. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition
   associated with altered brain connectivity. Previous neuroimaging
   research demonstrates inconsistent results, particularly in studies of
   functional connectivity in ASD. Typically, these inconsistent findings
   are results of studies using static measures of resting-state functional
   connectivity. Recent work has demonstrated that functional brain
   connections are dynamic, suggesting that static connectivity metrics
   fail to capture nuanced time-varying properties of functional
   connections in the brain. Here we used a dynamic functional connectivity
   approach to examine the differences in the strength and variance of
   dynamic functional connections between individuals with ASD and healthy
   controls (HCs). The variance of dynamic functional connections was
   defined as the respective standard deviations of the dynamic functional
   connectivity strength across time. We utilized a large multicenter
   dataset of 507 male subjects (209 with ASD and 298 HC, from 6 to 36
   years old) from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) to
   identify six distinct whole-brain dynamic functional connectivity
   states. Analyses demonstrated greater variance of widespread long-range
   dynamic functional connections in ASD (P < 0.05, NBS method) and weaker
   dynamic functional connections in ASD (P < 0.05, NBS method) within
   specific whole-brain connectivity states. Hypervariant dynamic
   connections were also characterized by weaker connectivity strength in
   ASD compared with HC. Increased variance of dynamic functional
   connections was also related to ASD symptom severity (ADOS total score)
   (P < 0.05), and was most prominent in connections related to the medial
   superior frontal gyrus and temporal pole. These results demonstrate that
   greater intraindividual dynamic variance is a potential biomarker of
   ASD. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Metaethical judgments refer to judgments about the information expressed
   by moral claims. Moral objectivists generally believe that moral claims
   are akin to facts, whereas moral subjectivists generally believe that
   moral claims are more akin to preferences. Evidence from developmental
   and social psychology has generally favored an objectivist view;
   however, this work has typically relied on few examples, and analyses
   have disallowed statistical generalizations beyond these few stimuli.
   The present work addresses whether morals are represented as fact-like
   or preference-like, using behavioral and neuroimaging methods, in
   combination with statistical techniques that can (a) generalize beyond
   our sample stimuli, and (b) test whether particular item features are
   associated with neural activity. Behaviorally, and contrary to prior
   work, morals were perceived as more preference-like than fact-like.
   Neurally, morals and preferences elicited common magnitudes and spatial
   patterns of activity, particularly within the dorsal-medial prefrontal
   cortex (DMPFC), a critical region for social cognition. This common
   DMPFC activity for morals and preferences was present across whole-brain
   conjunctions, and in individually localized functional regions of
   interest (targeting the theory of mind network). By contrast, morals and
   facts did not elicit any neural activity in common. Follow-up item
   analyses suggested that the activity elicited in common by morals and
   preferences was explained by their shared tendency to evoke
   representations of mental states. We conclude that morals are
   represented as far more subjective than prior work has suggested. This
   conclusion is consistent with recent theoretical research, which has
   argued that morality is fundamentally about regulating social
   relationships.}},

   following interference recruited visual and prefrontal cortices, showing
   that these regions support recollection when related information has

   target presentation recruited angular gyrus, indicating that this region
   supports recollection rejection when target representations are strong

Abstract = {{Background: There are overlaps between autism and schizophrenia but
   these are particularly pronounced, especially in social domains, for
   higher functioning individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or
   schizotypal personality disorder (SPD). It is not known whether these
   overlapping social deficits result from shared or distinct brain
   mechanisms. We therefore compared social cognition in ASD and SPD using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Methods: Twenty-one
   individuals with SPD, 28 with ASD and 33 controls were compared with
   respect to clinical symptoms using the Positive and Negative Syndrome
   Scale; social cognition, using a social judgment task and Ekman 60 faces
   task; and brain activation using an fMRI task of social judgment.
   Results: The ASD and SPD groups showed few differences in symptoms or
   social cognition. However, fMRI showed that, compared to ASD, the SPD
   group showed significantly greater activation during social compared to
   gender judgments in the amygdala and 3 clusters: right posterior
   cerebellum, extending into fusiform and inferior temporal gyri; left
   posterior cerebellum; and left intraparietal sulcus extending through
   medial portions of the temporal gyri into the fusiform gyrus (all P <
   .05 family-wise error corrected). Control activations lay between the
   ASD and SPD groups. Conclusions: Although social cognitive deficits in
   ASD and SPD appear superficially similar they are the result of
   different brain mechanisms. These findings have implications for
   therapeutic interventions targeted at social dysfunction in these
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Social cognition abilities are severely impaired in schizophrenia (SZ).
   The current meta-analysis used foci of 21 individual studies on
   functional abnormalities in the schizophrenic brain in order to identify
   regions that reveal convergent under- or over-activation during theory
   of mind (TOM) tasks. Studies were included in the analyses when
   contrasting tasks that require the processing of mental states with
   tasks which did not. Only studies that investigated patients with an ICD
   or DSM diagnosis were included. Quantitative voxel-based meta-analyses
   were done using Seed-based d Mapping software. Common TOM regions like
   medial-prefrontal cortex and temporo-parietal junction revealed abnormal
   activation in schizophrenic patients: Under-activation was identified in
   the medial prefrontal cortex, left orbito-frontal cortex, and in a small
   section of the left posterior temporo-parietal junction. Remarkably,
   robust over-activation was identified in a more dorsal, bilateral
   section of the temporo-parietal junction. Further abnormal activation
   was identified in medial occipito-parietal cortex, right premotor areas,
   left cingulate gyrus, and lingual gyrus. The findings of this study
   suggest that SZ patients simultaneously show over- and under-activation
   in TOM-related regions. Especially interesting, temporo-parietal
   junction reveals diverging activation patterns with an under-activating
   left posterior and an over-activating bilateral dorsal section. In
   conclusion, SZ patients show less specialized brain activation in
   regions linked to TOM and increased activation in attention-related
   networks suggesting compensatory effects.}},

Abstract = {{Poor emotion recognition is a core deficit in schizophrenia and is
   associated with poor functional outcome. Functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) multi-variate analysis methods were used to elucidate the
   neural underpinnings of face and emotion processing associated with both
   genetic liability and disease-specific effects. Schizophrenia patients,
   relatives, and controls completed a task that included 4 facial emotion
   discrimination conditions and an age discrimination condition during
   fMRI. Three functional networks were derived from the data: the first
   involved in visual attention and response generation, the second a
   default mode network (DMN), and a third involved in face and emotion
   processing. No differences in activation were found between groups for
   the visual attention and response generation network, suggesting that
   basic processes were intact. Both schizophrenia patients and relatives
   showed evidence for hyperdeactivation in the DMN compared to controls,
   with relatives being intermediate, suggesting a genetic liability
   effect. Both disease-specific and genetic liability effects were found
   for the face processing network, which included the amygdala. Patients
   exhibited lower coordinated network activity compared to controls and
   relatives across all facial discrimination conditions. Additionally, in
   relation to the other emotion discrimination conditions, a heightened
   coordinated response during fear and anger discrimination was observed
   in schizophrenia compared to other conditions, whereas relatives
   demonstrated heightened coordinated activity for anger discrimination
   only relative to other emotion conditions. With regards to brain
   functioning, this study found that schizophrenia is associated with
   abnormal processing of threat-related information, and that in part may
   be associated with the genetic risk for the disorder, suggesting that
   the facial and emotion processing network could be targeted for
   intervention.}},

Title = {{Rethinking the function of brain regions for reading Chinese characters
   in a meta-analysis of fMRI studies}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROLINGUISTICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{120-133}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies have proposed specific brain regions for reading
   Chinese characters. For example, compared to alphabetic languages,
   Chinese reading has revealed more activation of the left Middle Frontal
   Gyrus (MFG) and null or deactivation at left posterior Superior Temporal
   Gyrus (pSTG). However, the model of specific regions for Chinese was
   contested by recent findings showing similar activities across languages
   under the same task demand. Thus, whether the engagement of the
   Chinese-specific regions was due to stimulus selectivity or to task
   demand was called into question. The current meta-analysis, using
   Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE), summarized brain regions in
   previous NM studies from two types of contrast, stimulus contrasts (SC),
   in which more regions were activated for Chinese characters than for
   other visual stimuli (e.g., Korean words, faces) or for other types of
   characters (e.g., real > artificial characters), and task contrasts
   (TC), in which more regions were activated for one task than for another
   (e.g., lexical decision > symbol detection) in processing Chinese
   characters. ALE activation maps revealed a shared network for the two
   types of contrast, including the right Inferior Frontal Gyrus (IFG,
   BA47) and four clusters in the left hemisphere, the IFG (BA45/46),
   Superior Parietal Lobule, Superior Frontal Gyrus, and posterior Middle
   Temporal Gyrus (pMTG). The SC > TC comparison demonstrated the greater
   involvement of the left Angular Gyrus and left Fusiform Gyrus. The TC >
   SC comparison, in contrast, revealed the engagement of left hemisphere
   regions in the IFG, MFG, pSTG, pMTG, and Medial Frontal Gyrus. These
   results suggest that the previously identified Chinese-specific areas
   (e.g., MFG, pSTG) might be task dependent rather than stimulus
   selective. This work shed light on the language general neural network
   of visual word reading. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive reappraisal (CR) is regarded as an effective emotion
   regulation strategy. Acute stress, however, is believed to impair the
   functioning of prefrontal-based neural systems, which could result in
   lessened effectiveness of CR under stress. This study tested the
   behavioral and neurobiological impact of acute stress on CR. While
   undergoing fMRI, adult participants (n = 54) passively viewed or used CR
   to regulate their response to negative and neutral pictures and provided
   ratings of their negative affect in response to each picture. Half of
   the participants experienced an fMRI-adapted acute psychosocial stress
   manipulation similar to the Trier Social Stress Test, and a control
   group received parallel manipulations without the stressful components.
   Relative to the control group, the stress group exhibited heightened
   stress as indexed by self-report, heart rate, and salivary cortisol
   throughout the scan. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that
   reappraisal success was equivalent in the control and stress groups, as
   was electrodermal response to the pictures. Heart rate deceleration, a
   physiological response typically evoked by aversive pictures, was
   blunted in response to negative pictures and heightened in response to
   neutral pictures in the stress group. In the brain, we found weak
   evidence of stress-induced increases of reappraisal-related activity in
   parts of the PFC and left amygdala, but these relationships were
   statistically fragile. Together, these findings suggest that both the
   self-reported and neural effects of CR may be robust to at least
   moderate levels of stress, informing theoretical models of stress
   effects on cognition and emotion.}},

Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{We cannot see the minds of others, yet people often spontaneously
   interpret how they are viewed by other people (i.e., meta-perceptions)
   and often in a self-flattering manner. Very little is known about the
   neural associations of meta-perceptions, but a likely candidate is the
   ventromedial pFC (VMPFC). VMPFC has been associated with both self- and
   other-perception as well as motivated self-perception. Does this
   function extend to meta-perceptions? The current study examined neural
   activity while participants made meta-perceptive interpretations in
   various social scenarios. A drift-diffusion model was used to test
   whether the VMPFC is associated with two processes involved in
   interpreting meta-perceptions in a self-flattering manner: the extent to
   which the interpretation process involves the preferential accumulation
   of evidence in favor of a self-flattering interpretation versus the
   extent to which the interpretation process begins with an expectation
   that favors a self-flattering outcome. Increased VMPFC activity was
   associated with the extent to which people preferentially accumulate
   information when interpreting meta-perceptions under ambiguous
   conditions and marginally associated with self-flattering
   meta-perceptions. Together, the present findings illuminate the neural
   underpinnings of a social cognitive process that has received little
   attention to date: how we make meaning of others' minds when we think
   those minds are pointed at us.}},

Title = {{Sample heterogeneity in unipolar depression as assessed by functional
   connectivity analyses is dominated by general disease effects}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{222}},
Pages = {{79-87}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Combinations of resting-state fMRI and machine-learning
   techniques are increasingly employed to develop diagnostic models for
   mental disorders. However, little is known about the neurobiological
   heterogeneity of depression and diagnostic machine learning has mainly
   been tested in homogeneous samples. Our main objective was to explore
   the inherent structure of a diverse unipolar depression sample. The
   secondary objective was to assess, if such information can improve
   diagnostic classification.
   Materials and methods: We analyzed data from 360 patients with unipolar
   depression and 360 non-depressed population controls, who were
   subdivided into two independent subsets. Cluster analyses (unsupervised
   learning) of functional connectivity were used to generate hypotheses
   about potential patient subgroups from the first subset. The
   relationship of clusters with demographical and clinical measures was
   assessed. Subsequently, diagnostic classifiers (supervised learning),
   which incorporated information about these putative depression
   subgroups, were trained.
   Results: Exploratory cluster analyses revealed two weakly separable
   subgroups of depressed patients. These subgroups differed in the average
   duration of depression and in the proportion of patients with
   concurrently severe depression and anxiety symptoms. The diagnostic
   classification models performed at chance level.
   Limitations: It remains unresolved, if subgroups represent distinct
   biological subtypes, variability of continuous clinical variables or in
   part an overfitting of sparsely structured data.
   Conclusions: Functional connectivity in unipolar depression is
   associated with general disease effects. Cluster analyses provide
   hypotheses about potential depression subtypes. Diagnostic models did
   not benefit from this additional information regarding heterogeneity.}},

Title = {{Neuromoral Diversity: Individual, Gender, and Cultural Differences in
   the Ethical Brain}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{OCT 31}},
Abstract = {{The search for the neural correlates of moral judgment has been rapidly
   expanding in recent years. Perhaps the best-known search technique is
   neuroimaging, but significant contributions have also been made by
   fields including neuroendocrinology, neuropharmacology, neuropathology,
   and neurogenetics. In addition to the value this multidisciplinary
   search holds for social, cognitive, and affective neuroscience, it has
   far-reaching implications for philosophy (Greene, 2007), ethics (Tabery,
   2009), and law (Saks et al., 2014). While this search has yielded great
   advances in our scientific understanding of moral judgment over the past
   decade and a half, one important fact has been underappreciated by
   philosophers, ethicists, legal scholars, and even many neuroscientists.
   This is the fact that the neural correlates of moral judgment may be
   just as diverse as the people making those judgments.
   It may not be surprising that people's moral judgments track
   sociocultural background (Sarkissian et al., 2010), individual
   differences (Holtzman, 2013), and other factors (Schwitzgebel, 2010).
   But much more interesting is the fact that the neurobiological resources
   recruited in the service of moral judgments appear to vary along those
   same lines. Currently, much (though certainly not all) research in the
   neuroscience of moral judgment seeks to understand ``networks of the
   so-called `moral brain{''}' (Avram et al., 2014). ``The moral brain{''}
   typically refers to a theoretic construct that is partly premised on the
   idea that by studying how some brains formulate moral judgments, we can
   come to understand how brains in general do.
   While a unified conception of ``the moral brain{''} may be valuable to
   some extent, there is also an extent to which a truly comprehensive,
   scientific, and morally and philosophically justifiable conception of
   neuromoral processing must always keep in mind the nature and
   implications of variability between persons-and between their moral
   neurophysiologies. This is especially important in light of the fact
   that the overgeneralization of claims about the nature of moral judgment
   can raise not only scientific concerns, but also ethical and
   philosophical worries. I review evidence suggesting that there exists a
   wide variety of ways in which moral judgments may be realizable in human
   neural architecture. From this point of departure, I address just a few
   of the many implications that such neuromoral diversity-and the failure
   to fully appreciate neuromoral diversity-may have in philosophical,
   ethical, and legal contexts.}},

Title = {{Neural computations underlying inverse reinforcement learning in the

Journal = {{ELIFE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 30}},
Abstract = {{In inverse reinforcement learning an observer infers the reward
   distribution available for actions in the environment solely through
   observing the actions implemented by another agent. To address whether
   this computational process is implemented in the human brain,
   participants underwent fMRI while learning about slot machines yielding
   hidden preferred and non-preferred food outcomes with varying
   probabilities, through observing the repeated slot choices of agents
   with similar and dissimilar food preferences. Using formal model
   comparison, we found that participants implemented inverse RL as opposed
   to a simple imitation strategy, in which the actions of the other agent
   are copied instead of inferring the underlying reward structure of the
   decision problem. Our computational fMRI analysis revealed that anterior
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex encoded inferences about action-values
   within the value space of the agent as opposed to that of the observer,
   demonstrating that inverse RL is an abstract cognitive process
   divorceable from the values and concerns of the observer him/herself.}},

Title = {{Differential inter-subject correlation of brain activity when kinship is
   a variable in moral dilemma}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{OCT 27}},
Abstract = {{Previous behavioural studies have shown that humans act more
   altruistically towards kin. Whether and how knowledge of genetic
   relatedness translates into differential neurocognitive evaluation of
   observed social interactions has remained an open question. Here, we
   investigated how the human brain is engaged when viewing a moral dilemma
   between genetic vs. non-genetic sisters. During functional magnetic
   resonance imaging, a movie was shown, depicting refusal of organ
   donation between two sisters, with subjects guided to believe the
   sisters were related either genetically or by adoption. Although 90\% of
   the subjects self-reported that genetic relationship was not relevant,
   their brain activity told a different story. Comparing correlations of
   brain activity across all subject pairs between the two viewing
   conditions, we found significantly stronger inter-subject correlations
   in insula, cingulate, medial and lateral prefrontal, superior temporal,
   and superior parietal cortices, when the subjects believed that the
   sisters were genetically related. Cognitive functions previously
   associated with these areas include moral and emotional conflict
   regulation, decision making, and mentalizing, suggesting more similar
   engagement of such functions when observing refusal of altruism from a
   genetic sister. Our results show that mere knowledge of a genetic
   relationship between interacting persons robustly modulates social
   cognition of the perceiver.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies show that neural activities in the medial prefrontal
   cortex (mPFC) are correlated with moral processing during picture
   viewing tasks. In this study, we applied transcranial direct current
   stimulation (tDCS) to determine whether this non-invasive brain
   stimulation technique could modulate the evaluation of moral violations.
   Sixty-four subjects were randomly recruited, separated into different
   groups and tested with 42 pairs of pictures depicting moral violations.
   Each subject was required to rate the pictures two separate times, i.e.,
   before and after tDCS intervention. We found that anodal tDCS (atDCS)
   increases cortical excitability over the mPFC (between the Fpz and Fp1
   positions) as well as the sense of morality and emotional arousal of the
   subjects. In conclusion, this study indicated that the mPFC plays an
   important role in moral judgments while modulating ratings of moral
   violations under tDCS intervention conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Serotonin-producing neurons profusely innervate brain regions via
   long-range projections. However, it remains unclear whether and how
   endogenous serotonergic transmission specifically influences regional or
   global functional activity. We combined designed receptors exclusively
   activated by designed drugs (DREADD)-based chemogenetics and functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), an approach we term ``chemo-fMRI,''
   to causally probe the brain-wide substrates modulated by endogenous
   serotonergic activity. We describe the generation of a conditional
   knockin mouse line that, crossed with serotonin-specific Cre-recombinase
   mice, allowed us to remotely stimulate serotonergic neurons during fMRI
   scans. We show that endogenous stimulation of serotonin-producing
   neurons does not affect global brain activity but results in
   region-specific activation of a set of primary target regions
   encompassing corticohippocampal and ventrostriatal areas. By contrast,
   pharmacological boosting of serotonin levels produced widespread fMRI
   deactivation, plausibly reflecting the mixed contribution of central and
   perivascular constrictive effects. Our results identify the primary
   functional targets of endogenous serotonergic stimulation and establish
   causation between activation of serotonergic neurons and regional fMRI
   signals.}},

Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{362}},
Pages = {{219-227}},
Month = {{OCT 24}},
Abstract = {{Resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) is
   frequently used as a powerful technology to detect individual
   differences in many cognitive functions. Recently, some studies have
   explored the association between scale-free dynamic properties of
   resting-state brain activation and individual personality traits.
   However, little is known about whether the scale-free dynamics of
   resting state function networks is associated with delay discounting. To
   address this question, we calculated the Hurst exponent which quantifies
   long-term memory of the time series in resting-state networks (RSNs)
   identified via independent component analysis (ICA) and examined what
   relationship between delay discounting and the Hurst exponent of RSNs
   is. ICA results showed that entire nine RSNs were successfully
   recognized and extracted from independent components. After controlling
   some covariates, including gender, age, education, personality and trait
   anxiety, partial correlation analysis revealed that the Hurst exponent
   in default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN) was positively
   correlated with the delay discounting rates. No significant correlation
   between delay discounting and mean Hurst exponent of the whole brain was
   found. Thus, our results suggest the individual delay discounting is
   associated with the dynamics of inner-network interactions in the DMN
   and SN, and highlight the crucial role of scale-free dynamic properties
   of function networks on intertemporal choice. (C) 2017 Published by

Abstract = {{Primates are highly attuned not just to social characteristics of
   individual agents, but also to social interactions between multiple
   agents. Here we report a neural correlate of the representation of
   social interactions in the human brain. Specifically, we observe a
   strong univariate response in the posterior superior temporal sulcus
   (pSTS) to stimuli depicting social interactions between two agents,
   compared with (i) pairs of agents not interacting with each other, (ii)
   physical interactions between inanimate objects, and (iii) individual
   animate agents pursuing goals and interacting with inanimate objects. We
   further show that this region contains information about the nature of
   the social interaction-specifically, whether one agent is helping or
   hindering the other. This sensitivity to social interactions is
   strongest in a specific subregion of the pSTS but extends to a lesser
   extent into nearby regions previously implicated in theory of mind and
   dynamic face perception. This sensitivity to the presence and nature of
   social interactions is not easily explainable in terms of low-level
   visual features, attention, or the animacy, actions, or goals of
   individual agents. This region may underlie our ability to understand
   the structure of our social world and navigate within it.}},

   empathic responses. Our study uses fMRI to determine how regions
   involved in the perception of pain interact with regions implicated in
   empathic regulation in these two groups, relative to controls. When
   observing pain in others (minor injuries to the hands and feet), the two
   responder groups show activation in both the sensory/discriminative and
   affective/motivational components of the pain matrix. The control group
   only showed activation in the latter. The two responder groups showed
   clear differences in functional connectivity. Notably, Sensory/Localized
   responders manifest significant coupling between the right
   temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ) and bilateral anterior insula. We
   conclude that conscious experiences of vicarious pain is supported by
   specific patterns of functional connectivity between pain-related and
   regulatory regions, and not merely increased activity within the pain
   matrix itself.}},

Title = {{Altered behavioral and amygdala habituation in high-functioning adults
   with autism spectrum disorder: an fMRI study}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{OCT 19}},
Abstract = {{Habituation to repeatedly presented stimuli is an important adaptive
   property of the nervous system. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been
   associated with reduced neural habituation, for example in the amygdala,
   which may be related to social impairments. The main focus of this study
   was to investigate habituation effects on the level of behavioral
   responses as well as amygdala responses in adults with ASD during a
   working memory task flanked by task-irrelevant face stimuli. Twenty-two
   patients with high-functioning autism and 24 healthy controls (HC) were
   included in this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. We
   employed an established habituation index to investigate habituation
   effects. Suggestive of altered habituation, the habituation index showed
   a decrement of reaction time over the course of the experiment in the HC
   but not in the ASD group. Similarly, an expected pattern of habituation
   was evident in amygdala activation in HC but absent in ASD participants.
   These results provide evidence that habituation may be altered not only
   on a neural, but also on a behavioral level in ASD. While more research
   is needed to develop a better understanding of the underlying
   mechanisms, the current findings support the possibility that deficient
   habituation may be a biomarker of ASD.}},

Title = {{Getting the Joke: Insight during Humor Comprehension - Evidence from an
   fMRI Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{OCT 18}},
Abstract = {{As a high-level cognitive activity, humor comprehension requires
   incongruity detection and incongruity resolution, which then elicits an
   insight moment. The purpose of the study was to explore the neural basis
   of humor comprehension, particularly the moment of insight, by using
   both characters and language-free cartoons in a functional magnetic
   resonance imaging study. The results showed that insight involving jokes
   elicited greater activation in language and semantic-related brain
   regions as well as a variety of additional regions, such as the superior
   frontal gyrus (SFG), the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), the middle
   temporal gyrus (MTG), the superior temporal gyrus (STG), the
   temporoparietal junctions (TPJ), the hippocampus and visual areas. These
   findings indicate that the MTG might play a role in incongruity
   detection, while the SFG, IFG and the TPJ might be involved in
   incongruity detection. The passive insight event elicited by jokes
   appears to be mediated by a limited number of brain areas. Our study
   showed that the brain regions associated with humor comprehension were
   not affected by the type of stimuli and that humor and insight shared
   common brain areas. These results indicate that one experiences a
   feeling of insight during humor comprehension, which contributes to the
   understanding of humor comprehension.}},

Title = {{From provocation to aggression: the neural network}},
Journal = {{BMC NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{OCT 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: In-vivo observations of neural processes during human
   aggressive behavior are difficult to obtain, limiting the number of
   studies in this area. To address this gap, the present study implemented
   a social reactive aggression paradigm in 29 healthy men, employing
   non-violent provocation in a two-player game to elicit aggressive
   behavior in fMRI settings.
   Results: Participants responded more aggressively after high provocation
   reflected in taking more money from their opponents. Comparing
   aggression trials after high provocation to those after low provocation
   revealed activations in neural circuits involved in aggression: the
   medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), the anterior cingulate cortex
   (ACC), and the insula. In general, our findings indicate that aggressive
   behavior activates a complex, widespread brain network, reflecting a
   cortico-limbic interaction and overlapping with circuits underlying
   negative emotions and conflicting decision-making. Brain activation
   during provocation in the OFC was associated with the degree of
   aggressive behavior in this task.
   Conclusion: Therefore, data suggest there is greater susceptibility for
   provocation, rather than less inhibition of aggressive tendencies, in
   individuals with higher aggressive responses. This further supports the
   hypothesis that reactive aggression can be seen as a consequence of
   provocation of aggressive emotional responses and parallel evaluative
   regulatory processes mediated mainly by the insula and prefrontal areas
   (OFC, mPFC, dlPFC, and ACC) respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Chronic primary insomnia (CPI) is the most prevalent sleep
   disorder worldwide. CPI manifests as difficulties in sleep onset,
   maintaining sleep, prolonged sleep latency, and daytime impairment and
   is often accompanied by cognitive problems such as poor academic
   performance, poor attention, and decreased memory. The most popular
   explanation of insomnia is hyperarousal or increased activities of
   neurons. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep detected by polysomnography
   (PSG) exhibits a positive relationship with brain homeostasis and can be
   helpful for optimally preparing an organism for emotional and social
   function. Limited work has been performed to explore brain function of
   insomnia patients in combination with PSG analysis.
   Results: We observed increased ALFF within areas related to hyperarousal
   such as the midbrain and bilateral extra-nucleus, whereas decreased ALFF
   was observed within areas associated with memory and attention involving
   the parietal and occipital lobule and others. Furthermore, the altered
   ALFF was associated with the duration of insomnia, sleep efficiency,
   duration of REM, latency of RME and ratio of REM.
   Materials and Methods: In this study, we recruited twenty-five CPI
   patients and twenty-five normal sleep (NS) volunteers as a control group
   to investigate the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and
   the correlation between those altered ALFF regions through resting-state
   fMRI and PSG data.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that hyperarousal reflected by ALFF
   abnormality within brain areas related to cognition and emotion in
   insomnia associated with REM sleep.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals differ systematically in their vulnerability to injustice.
   Previous studies have developed the efficient measurement of justice
   sensitivity from four perspectives (victim, observer, beneficiary, and
   perpetrator), and examined its effect on interpersonal interactions, but
   little is known about the neural correlates of justice sensitivity. The
   present study used regional homogeneity (ReHo) as an index in
   resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) to identify brain regions correlated with
   individual differences in justice sensitivity. Results showed that
   victim sensitivity was positively associated with ReHo of the
   paracentral lobule; observer sensitivity was positively associated with
   the temporal pole; beneficiary sensitivity was positively associated
   with bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and negatively
   correlated with the amygdala; and perpetrator sensitivity was negatively
   associated with bilateral orbital frontal cortex (OFC), and positively
   correlated with the dorsal striatum. Our results revealed the
   associations between individual differences in justice sensitivity and
   intrinsic brain activity, and implicated the underlying differences
   among the four perspectives. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to
   investigate the global spontaneous neural activity involved in
   pathological laughing and crying after stroke. Twelve pathological
   laughing and crying patients with isolated pontine infarction were
   included, along with 12 age-and gender-matched acute isolated pontine
   infarction patients without pathological laughing and crying, and 12
   age-and gender-matched healthy controls. We examined both the amplitude
   of low-frequency fluctuation and the regional homogeneity in order to
   comprehensively evaluate the intrinsic activity in patients with
   post-stroke pathological laughing and crying. In the post-stroke
   pathological laughing and crying group, changes in these measures were
   observed mainly in components of the default mode network (medial
   prefrontal cortex/anterior cingulate cortex, middle temporal gyrus,
   inferior temporal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus
   and inferior parietal lobule), sensorimotor network (supplementary motor
   area, precentral gyrus and paracentral lobule), affective network
   (medial prefrontal cortex/anterior cingulate cortex, parahippocampal
   gyrus, middle temporal gyrus and inferior temporal gyrus) and cerebellar
   lobes (cerebellum posterior lobe). We therefore speculate that when
   disinhibition of the volitional system is lost, increased activation of
   the emotional system causes pathological laughing and crying.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 12}},
Abstract = {{Here we examined neural substrates for physically and observationally
   learning to construct novel objects, and characterized brain regions
   associated with each kind of learning using fMRI. Each participant was
   assigned a training partner, and for five consecutive days practiced
   tying one group of knots ({''}tied{''} condition) or watched their
   partner tie different knots ({''}watched{''} condition) while a third
   set of knots remained untrained. Functional MRI was obtained prior to
   and immediately following the week of training while participants
   performed a visual knot-matching task. After training, a portion of left
   superior parietal lobule demonstrated a training by scan session
   interaction. This means this parietal region responded selectively to
   knots that participants had physically learned to tie in the
   post-training scan session but not the pre-training scan session. A
   conjunction analysis on the post-training scan data showed right
   intraparietal sulcus and right dorsal premotor cortex to respond when
   viewing images of knots from the tied and watched conditions compared to
   knots that were untrained during the post-training scan session. This
   suggests that these brain areas track both physical and observational
   learning. Together, the data provide preliminary evidence of engagement
   of brain regions associated with hand-object interactions when viewing
   objects associated with physical experience, and with observational
   experience without concurrent physical practice.}},

Abstract = {{Language comprehension engages a cortical network of left frontal and
   temporal regions. Activity in this network is language-selective,
   showing virtually no modulation by nonlinguistic tasks. In addition,
   language comprehension engages a second network consisting of bilateral
   frontal, parietal, cingulate, and insular regions. Activity in this
   ``multiple demand{''} (MD) network scales with comprehension difficulty,
   but also with cognitive effort across a wide range of nonlinguistic
   tasks in a domain-general fashion. Given the functional dissociation
   between the language and MD networks, their respective contributions to
   comprehension are likely distinct, yet such differences remain elusive.
   Prior neuroimaging studies have suggested that activity in each network
   covaries with some linguistic features that, behaviorally, influence
   on-line processing and comprehension. This sensitivity of the language
   and MD networks to local input characteristics has often been
   interpreted, implicitly or explicitly, as evidence that both networks
   track linguistic input closely, and in a manner consistent across
   individuals. Here, weused fMRI to directly test this assumption by
   comparing the BOLD signal time courses in each network across different
   people (n = 45, men and women) listening to the same story. Language
   network activity showed fewer individual differences, indicative of
   closer input tracking, whereas MD network activity was more
   idiosyncratic and, moreover, showed lower reliability within an
   individual across repetitions of a story. These findings constrain
   cognitive models of language comprehension by suggesting a novel
   distinction between the processes implemented in the language and MD
   networks.}},

Abstract = {{Because of their difficulties with figurative language in conversation,
   it is commonly thought that individuals with autism spectrum disorder
   (ASD) do not understand figurative meaning. However, recent research
   indicates that individuals with and without ASD are similar in the first
   two stages of metaphor comprehension, up to and including successful
   generation of the figurative meaning. In the current study, we used a
   sentence decision task to evaluate the subsequent stage of metaphor
   comprehension, the selection stage, which requires
   suppression/inhibition of the unintended meaning as part of selecting
   the intended meaning. fMRI activation and functional connectivity were
   used to compare the selection stage of metaphor comprehension between
   high-functioning individuals with ASD and carefully matched controls.
   Cortical and subcortical regions of interest were selected based on the
   basal ganglia model of cognitive control. Compared to controls,
   individuals with ASD recruited greater activation in regions related to
   verbal memory (thalamus), semantic associations (medial temporal gyrus),
   and basic visual processing (middle occipital gyrus). Functional
   connectivity analysis revealed fewer overall connections and
   cortical-subcortical connections in the ASD group compared to controls.
   There was a novel finding of maintenance of subcortical-subcortical
   connectivity in the ASD group, specific to the selection condition,
   despite differences in cortically involved connections. Reduced
   cortical-subcortical connectivity in the ASD group compared to controls
   may reflect a more global impairment in cognitive control pathways,
   while consistent subcortical-subcortical connectivity may reflect
   systemic inflexibility or preserved subcortical function and
   dissociation between subcortical and cortical systems. Further
   investigation is required. (C) 2017 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The nicotinic system plays an important role in cognitive control and is
   implicated in several neuropsychiatric conditions. However, the
   contributions of genetic variability in this system to individuals'
   cognitive control abilities are poorly understood and the brain
   processes that mediate such genetic contributions remain largely
   unidentified. In this first large-scale neuroimaging genetics study of
   the human nicotinic receptor system (two cohorts, males and females,
   fMRI total N = 1586, behavioral total N = 3650), we investigated a
   common polymorphism of the high-affinity nicotinic receptor alpha 4 beta
   2 (rs1044396 on the CHRNA4 gene) previously implicated in behavioral and
   nicotine-related studies (albeit with inconsistent major/minor allele
   impacts). Based on our prior neuroimaging findings, we expected this
   polymorphism to affect neural activity in the cingulo-opercular (CO)
   network involved in core cognitive control processes including
   maintenance of alertness. Consistent across the cohorts, all cortical
   areas of the CO network showed higher activity in heterozygotes compared
   with both types of homozygotes during cognitive engagement. This
   inverted U-shaped relation reflects an overdominant effect; that is,
   allelic interaction (cumulative evidence p = 1.33 {*} 10(-5)).
   Furthermore, heterozygotes performed more accurately in behavioral tasks
   that primarily depend on sustained alertness. No effects were observed
   for haplotypes of the surrounding CHRNA4 region, supporting a true
   overdominant effect at rs1044396. As a possible mechanism, we observed
   that this polymorphism is an expression quantitative trait locus
   modulating CHRNA4 expression levels. This is the first report of
   overdominance in the nicotinic system. These findings connect CHRNA4
   genotype, CO network activation, and sustained alertness, providing
   insights into how genetics shapes individuals' cognitive control
   abilities.}},

Abstract = {{Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is highly prevalent and associated
   with impairment, even at the subthreshold level. It is therefore
   important to identify biological processes that contribute to the
   pathophysiology of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Although
   neuroimaging research has highlighted the importance of heightened
   amygdala reactivity to aversive stimuli in PTSS, not all studies have
   yielded evidence of this relationship. Given that PTSS is comprised of
   four, factor analytically distinct dimensions of symptoms -
   re-experiencing, avoidance, hyperarousal, and negative cognitions and
   mood - it is possible that heightened amygdala reactivity to aversive
   stimuli is specific to certain PTSS clusters. In a sample of 45
   trauma-exposed individuals, the present study therefore examined how
   specific PTSS clusters relate to amygdala responding during functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to both negative and positive
   emotional faces during a well-validated social-emotional task, the
   Emotional Face Assessment Task (EFAT). Results indicated that
   hyperarousal symptoms were positively associated with left amygdala
   reactivity across all emotional face conditions. There was no
   interaction of hyperarousal by condition (i. e., fearful, sad, angry, or
   happy faces), and other PTSS clusters were not associated with amygdala
   reactivity. These results indicate that the hyperarousal cluster of PTSS
   may have a unique relationship with amygdala reactivity to
   socioemotional information. The results also corroborate a growing
   literature suggesting that trauma-exposed individuals characterized by
   high PTSS hyperarousal symptoms may display exaggerated
   psychophysiological reactivity to appetitive and aversive stimuli.}},

Journal = {{DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{27}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Adolescent sexual risk behavior can lead to serious health consequences,
   yet few investigations have addressed its neurodevelopmental mechanisms.
   Social neurocircuitry is postulated to underlie the development of risky
   sexual behavior, and response to social reward may be especially
   relevant. Typically developing adolescents (N = 47; 18M, 29F; 16.3 +/-
   1.4 years; 42.5\% sexual intercourse experience) completed a social
   reward fMRI task and reported their sexual risk behaviors (e.g.,
   lifetime sexual partners) on the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS).
   Neural response and functional connectivity to social reward were
   compared for adolescents with higher-and lower-risk sexual behavior.
   Adolescents with higher-risk sexual behaviors demonstrated increased
   activation in the right precuneus and the right temporoparietal junction
   during receipt of social reward. Adolescents with higher-risk sexual
   behaviors also demonstrated greater functional connectivity between the
   precuneus and the temporoparietal junction bilaterally, dorsal medial
   prefrontal cortex, and left anterior insula/ventrolateral prefrontal
   cortex. The greater activation and functional connectivity in
   self-referential, social reward, and affective processing regions among
   higher sexual risk adolescents underscores the importance of social
   influence underlying sexual risk behaviors. Furthermore, results suggest
   an orientation towards and sensitivity to social rewards among youth
   engaging in higher-risk sexual behavior, perhaps as a consequence of or
   vulnerability to such behavior.}},

Journal = {{DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{27}},
Pages = {{99-106}},

Abstract = {{Rumination in response to stress (stress-reactive rumination) has been
   linked to higher levels of depressive symptoms in adolescents. However,
   no work to date has examined the neural mechanisms connecting
   stress-reactive rumination and adolescent depressive symptoms. The
   present work attempted to bridge this gap through an fMRI study of 41
   adolescent girls (M-age = 15.42, SD = 0.33) - a population in whom
   elevated levels of depressive symptoms, rumination, and social stress
   sensitivity are displayed. During the scan, participants completed two
   tasks: an emotion regulation task and a social stress task. Using
   psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses, we found that positive
   functional connectivity between the amygdala and ventrolateral
   prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) during the emotion regulation task mediated
   the association between stress-reactive rumination and depressive
   symptoms. These results suggest that stress-reactive rumination may
   interfere with the expression and development of neural connectivity
   patterns associated with effective emotion regulation, which may
   contribute, in turn, to heightened depressive symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{Neural activity is an important biomarker for the presence of
   neurodegenerative diseases, cerebrovascular alterations, and brain
   trauma; furthermore, it is a surrogate marker for treatment effects.
   These pathologies may occur and evolve in a long time-period, thus,
   noninvasive, transcutaneous techniques are necessary to allow a
   longitudinal follow-up. In the present work, we have customized
   noninvasive, transcutaneous, diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) to
   localize changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) induced by neural
   activity. We were able to detect changes in CBF in the somatosensory
   cortex by using a model of electrical forepaw stimulation in rats. The
   suitability of DCS measurements for longitudinal monitoring was
   demonstrated by performing multiple sessions with the same animals at
   different ages (from 6 to 18 months). In addition, functional DCS has
   been cross-validated by comparison with functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) in the same animals in a subset of the time-points. The
   overall results obtained with transcutaneous DCS demonstrates that it
   can be utilized in longitudinal studies safely and reproducibly to
   locate changes in CBF induced by neural activity in the small animal
   brain. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative Commons

Abstract = {{Even though much has recently been learned about the neural
   representation of individual concepts and categories, neuroimaging
   research is only beginning to reveal how more complex thoughts, such as
   event and state descriptions, are neurally represented. We present a
   predictive computational theory of the neural representations of
   individual events and states as they are described in 240 sentences.
   Regression models were trained to determine the mapping between 42
   neurally plausible semantic features (NPSFs) and thematic roles of the
   concepts of a proposition and the fMRI activation patterns of various
   cortical regions that process different types of information. Given a
   semantic characterization of the content of a sentence that is new to
   the model, the model can reliably predict the resulting neural
   signature, or, given an observed neural signature of a new sentence, the
   model can predict its semantic content. The models were also reliably
   generalizable across participants. This computational model provides an
   account of the brain representation of a complex yet fundamental unit of
   thought, namely, the conceptual content of a proposition. In addition to
   characterizing a sentence representation at the level of the semantic
   and thematic features of its component concepts, factor analysis was
   used to develop a higher level characterization of a sentence,
   specifying the general type of event representation that the sentence
   evokes (e. g., a social interaction versus a change of physical state)
   and the voxel locations most strongly associated with each of the
   factors. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Title = {{Self-construal differences in neural responses to negative social cues}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{129}},
Pages = {{62-72}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Cultures differ substantially in representations of the self. Whereas
   individualistic cultural groups emphasize an independent self, reflected
   in processing biases towards centralized salient objects, collectivistic
   cultures are oriented towards an interdependent self, attending to
   contextual associations between visual cues. It is unknown how these
   perceptual biases may affect brain activity in response to negative
   social cues. Moreover, while some studies have shown that individual
   differences in self-construal moderate cultural group comparisons, few
   have examined self-construal differences separate to culture. To
   investigate these issues, a final sample of a group of healthy
   participants high in trait levels of collectivistic self-construal (n =
   16) and individualistic self-construal (n = 19), regardless of cultural
   background, completed a negative social cue evaluation task designed to
   engage face/object vs context-specific neural processes whilst
   undergoing fMRI scanning. Between-group analyses revealed that the
   collectivistic group exclusively engaged the parahippocampal gyrus
   (parahippocampal place area) -a region critical to contextual
   integration -during negative face processing - suggesting compensatory
   activations when contextual information was missing. The collectivist
   group also displayed enhanced negative context dependent brain activity
   involving the left superior occipital gyrus/cuneus and right anterior
   insula. By contrast, the individualistic group did not engage object or
   localized face processing regions as predicted, but rather demonstrated
   heightened appraisal and self-referential activations in medial
   prefrontal and temporoparietal regions to negative contexts - again
   suggesting compensatory processes when focal cues were absent. While
   individualists also appeared more sensitive to negative faces in the

Abstract = {{Information processing in specialized, spatially distributed brain
   networks underlies the diversity and complexity of our cognitive and
   behavioral repertoire. Networks converge at a small number of hubs
   highly connected regions that are central for multimodal integration and
   higher-order cognition. We review one major network hub of the human
   brain: the inferior parietal lobule and the overlapping temporoparietal
   junction (IPL/TPJ). The IPL is greatly expanded in humans compared to
   other primates and matures late in human development, consistent with
   its importance in higher-order functions. Evidence from neuroimaging
   studies suggests that the IPL/TPJ participates in a broad range of
   behaviors and functions, from bottom-up perception to cognitive
   capacities that are uniquely human. The organization of the IPL/TPJ is
   challenging to study due to the complex anatomy and high
   inter-individual variability of this. cortical region. In this review we
   aimed to synthesize findings from anatomical and functional studies of
   the IPL/TPJ that used neuroimaging at rest and during a wide range of
   tasks. The first half of the review describes subdivisions of the
   IPL/TPJ identified using cytoarchitectonics, resting-state functional
   connectivity analysis and structural connectivity methods. The second
   half of the article reviews IPL/TPJ activations and network
   participation in bottom-up attention, lower order self-perception,
   undirected thinking, episodic memory and social cognition. The central
   theme of this review is to discuss how network nodes within the IPL/TPJ
   are organized and how they participate in human perception and
   cognition.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have investigated personal moral violations with
   different references (i.e., the protagonists in moral scenarios are the
   participants themselves or unknown other individuals). However, the
   roles of various agents in moral judgments have remained unclear. In the
   present study, ERPs were used to investigate moral judgments when the
   participants viewed gossip that described (im) moral behaviors committed
   by different agents (self, friend, celebrity). The results demonstrate
   that the P2 and late positive component (LPC) correspond to two
   successive processes of indirect moral judgment when individuals process
   gossip. Specifically, the P2 amplitude in the celebrity condition was
   more sensitive in distinguishing immoral behaviors from moral behaviors
   than that in the other two conditions, whereas the moral valence effect
   on the LPC was predominately driven by the self-reference. These
   findings expand our current understanding of moral judgments in a gossip
   evaluation task and demonstrate that the early processing of gossip
   depends on both the entertainment value of the agent and the salience of
   moral behaviors. Processing in the later stage reflects reactions to
   intensified affective stimuli, or reflects cognitive effort that was
   required to resolve the conflict between negative gossip about self and
   the self-positivity bias.}},

Title = {{Do You Believe It? Verbal Suggestions Influence the Clinical and Neural

Abstract = {{Background: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly
   prescribed for depression and anxiety, but their efficacy relative to
   placebo has been questioned. We aimed to test how manipulation of
   verbally induced expectancies, central for placebo, influences SSRI
   treatment outcome and brain activity in patients with social anxiety
   disorder (SAD).
   Methods: Wedid a randomized clinical trial, within an academicmedical
   center (Uppsala, Sweden), of individuals fulfilling the DSM-IV criteria
   for SAD, recruited through media advertising. Participants were 18 years
   or older and randomized in blocks, through a computer-generated sequence
   by an independent party, to nine weeks of overt or covert treatment with
   escitalopram(20mg daily). The overt group received correct treatment
   information whereas the covert group was treated deceptively with the
   SSRI described, by the psychiatrist, as active placebo. The treating
   psychiatrist was necessarily unmasked while the research staff was
   masked from intervention assignment. Treatment efficacy was assessed
   primarily with the self-rated Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSASSR),
   administered at week 0, 1, 3, 6 and 9, also yielding a dichotomous
   estimate of responder status (clinically significant improvement).
   Before and at the last week of treatment, brain activity during an
   emotional face matching task was assessed with functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) and during fMRI sessions, anticipatory speech
   anxiety was also assessed with the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety
   Inventory-State version (STAI-S). Analyses included all randomized
   patients with outcome data at posttreatment. This study is registered at
   ISRCTN, number 98890605.
   Findings: Between March 17th 2014 and May 22nd 2015, 47 patients were
   recruited. One patient in the covert group dropped out after a few days
   of treatment and did not provide fMRI data, leaving 46 patients with
   complete outcome data. After nine weeks of treatment, overt (n - 24) as
   compared to covert (n - 22) SSRI administration yielded significantly
   better outcome on the LSAS-SR (adjusted difference 21.17, 95\% CI
   10.69-31.65, p < 0.0001) with more than three times higher response rate
   (50\% vs. 14\%;chi(2)(1)= 6.91, p= 0.009) and twice the effect size (d=
   2.24 vs. d= 1.13) from pre-to posttreatment. There was no significant
   between-group difference on anticipatory speech anxiety (STAI-S), both
   groups improving with treatment. No serious adverse reactions were
   recorded. On fMRI outcomes, there was suggestive evidence for a
   differential neural response to treatment between groups in the
   posterior cingulate, superior temporal and inferior frontal gyri (all z
   thresholds exceeding 3.68, p <= 0.001). Reduced social anxiety with
   treatment correlated significantly with enhanced posterior cingulate (z
   threshold 3.24, p - 0.0006) and attenuated amygdala (z threshold 2.70, p
   - 0.003) activity.
   Interpretation: The clinical and neural effects of escitalopram were
   markedly influenced by verbal suggestions. This points to a pronounced
   placebo component in SSRI-treatment of SAD and favors a biopsychosocial
   over a biomedical explanatory model for SSRI efficacy. (C) 2017 The

Abstract = {{The beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol benefits some social and
   communication domains affected in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and
   these benefits appear to be associated with increased functional
   connectivity (FC) in the brain during task performance. FC is implicated
   in ASD, with the majority of studies suggesting long distance
   hypo-connectivity combined with regionally specific local
   hyper-connectivity. The objective in the current investigation was to
   examine the effect of propranolol on FC at rest and determine whether
   ASD-specific effects exist. Participants with and without ASD attended
   three sessions in which propranolol, nadolol (a beta-adrenergic
   antagonist that does not cross the blood-brain barrier), or placebo were
   administered. Resting-state fMRI data were acquired, and graph theory
   techniques were utilized to assess additional aspects of FC. Compared to
   placebo, propranolol administration was associated with decreased FC in
   the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex subnetwork of the default mode
   network and increased FC in the medial temporal lobe subnetwork,
   regardless of diagnosis. These effects were not seen with nadolol
   suggesting that the alterations in FC following propranolol
   administration were not exclusively due to peripheral cardiovascular
   effects. Thus, beta-adrenergic antagonism can up- or down- regulate FC,
   depending on the network, and alter coordinated functional activation in
   the brain. These changes in information processing, as demonstrated by
   FC, may mediate some of the clinical and behavioral effects of
   beta-adrenergic antagonism previously reported in patients with ASD.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveWe hypothesized that children with benign childhood epilepsy
   with centrotemporal spikes (BCECTS) might have altered social cognitive
   skills and underlying neural networks.
   MethodsWe studied 13 patients with BCECTS and 11 age-matched controls
   using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with an
   emotional discrimination task consisting of viewing happy, fearful,
   scrambled, and neutral faces. Behavioral performance measured during the
   task was correlated with clinical variables and behavioral ratings.
   ResultsIn comparison with age-matched controls, children with BCECTS
   performing a fearful faces detection task showed significantly reduced
   bilateral fMRI activation in the insular cortex, caudate, and lentiform
   nuclei, as well as increased response time. The percentage of errors
   made by children with BCECTS correlated negatively with age, a finding
   not observed in controls. In patients, accuracy positively correlated
   with time since the last seizure. The above abnormalities were not
   observed during happy faces detection task, except for a slower response
   in children with BCECTS as compared to controls.
   SignificanceOur study suggests that BCECTS is associated with altered
   social cognition network and function, particularly for the
   identification of fearful faces. The age dependency of some of these
   findings supports the view that a delayed maturation of spiking cortical
   regions might underlie the cognitive dysfunction observed in BCECTS.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{159}},
Pages = {{18-31}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Sensorimotor transformation (ST) may be a critical process in mapping
   perceived speech input onto non-native (L2) phonemes, in support of
   subsequent speech production. Yet, little is known concerning the role
   of ST with respect to L2 speech, particularly where learned L2 phones
   (e.g., vowels) must be produced in more complex lexical contexts (e.g.,
   multi-syllabic words). Here, we charted the behavioral and neural
   outcomes of producing trained L2 vowels at word level, using a speech
   imitation paradigm and functional MRI. We asked whether participants
   would be able to faithfully imitate trained L2 vowels when they occurred
   in non-words of varying complexity (one or three syllables). Moreover,
   we related individual differences in imitation success during training
   to BOLD activation during ST (i.e., pre-imitation listening), and during
   later imitation. We predicted that superior temporal and peri-Sylvian
   speech regions would show increased activation as a function of item
   complexity and non-nativeness of vowels, during ST. We further
   anticipated that pre-scan acoustic learning performance would predict
   BOLD activation for non-native (vs. native) speech during ST and
   imitation. We found individual differences in imitation success for
   training on the non-native vowel tokens in isolation; these were
   preserved in a subsequent task, during imitation of mono-and trisyllabic
   words containing those vowels. fMRI data revealed a widespread network
   involved in ST, modulated by both vowel nativeness and utterance
   complexity: superior temporal activation increased monotonically with
   complexity, showing greater activation for non-native than native vowels
   when presented in isolation and in trisyllables, but not in
   monosyllables. Individual differences analyses showed that learning
   versus lack of improvement on the non-native vowel during pre-scan
   training predicted increased ST activation for non-native compared with
   native items, at insular cortex, pre-SMA/SMA, and cerebellum. Our
   results hold implications for the importance of ST as a process
   underlying successful imitation of non-native speech.}},

Abstract = {{Characterizing how representations of moral violations are organized,
   cognitively and neurally, is central to understanding how people
   conceive and judge them. Past work has identified brain regions that
   represent morally relevant features and distinguish moral domains, but
   has not yet advanced a broader account of where and on what basis neural
   representations of moral violations are organized. With searchlight
   representational similarity analysis, we investigate where category
   membership drives similarity in neural patterns during moral judgment of
   violations from two key moral domains: Harm and Purity. Representations
   converge across domains in a network of regions resembling the
   mentalizing network. However, Harm and Purity violation representations
   respectively converge in different regions: precuneus (PC) and left
   inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG). Examining substructure within moral
   domains, Harm violations converge in PC regardless of subdomain
   (physical harms, psychological harms), while Purity subdomains
   (pathogen-related violations, sex-related violations) converge in
   distinct sets of regions mirroring a dissociation observed in
   principal-component analysis of behavioral data. Further, we find
   initial evidence for representation of morally relevant features within
   these two domain-encoding regions. The present analyses offer a case
   study for understanding how organization within the complex conceptual
   space of moral violations is reflected in the organization of neural
   patterns across the cortex.}},

   medial prefrontal cortex}},
Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{43-54}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Social interactions can be facilitated by action-outcome contingency, in
   which self-actions result in relevant responses from others. Research
   has indicated that the striatal reward system plays a role in generating
   action-outcome contingency signals. However, the neural mechanisms
   wherein signals regarding self-action and others' responses are
   integrated to generate the contingency signal remain poorly understood.
   We conducted a functional MRI study to test the hypothesis that brain
   activity representing the self modulates connectivity between the
   striatal reward system and sensory regions involved in the processing of
   others' responses. We employed a contingency task in which participants
   made the listener laugh by telling jokes. Participants reported more
   pleasure when greater laughter followed their own jokes than those of
   another. Self-relevant listener's responses produced stronger activation
   in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Laughter was associated with
   activity in the auditory cortex. The ventral striatum exhibited stronger
   activation when participants made listeners laugh than when another did.
   In physio-physiological interaction analyses, the ventral striatum
   showed interaction effects for signals extracted from the mPFC and
   auditory cortex. These results support the hypothesis that the mPFC,
   which is implicated in self-related processing, gates sensory input
   associated with others' responses during value processing in the ventral
   striatum. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.}},

Title = {{Distinct prediction errors in mesostriatal circuits of the human brain
   mediate learning about the values of both states and actions: evidence
   from high-resolution fMRI}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Prediction-error signals consistent with formal models of
   ``reinforcement learning{''} (RL) have repeatedly been found within
   dopaminergic nuclei of the midbrain and dopaminoceptive areas of the
   striatum. However, the precise form of the RL algorithms implemented in
   the human brain is not yet well determined. Here, we created a novel
   paradigm optimized to dissociate the subtypes of reward-prediction
   errors that function as the key computational signatures of two distinct
   classes of RL models D namely, ``actor/critic{''} models and
   action-value-learning models (e.g., the Q-learning model). The
   state-value-prediction error (SVPE), which is independent of actions, is
   a hallmark of the actor/critic architecture, whereas the
   action-value-prediction error (AVPE) is the distinguishing feature of
   action-value-learning algorithms. To test for the presence of these
   prediction-error signals in the brain, we scanned human participants
   with a high-resolution functional magnetic-resonance imaging (fMRI)
   protocol optimized to enable measurement of neural activity in the
   dopaminergic midbrain as well as the striatal areas to which it
   projects. In keeping with the actor/critic model, the SVPE signal was
   detected in the substantia nigra. The SVPE was also clearly present in
   both the ventral striatum and the dorsal striatum. However, alongside
   these purely state-value-based computations we also found evidence for
   AVPE signals throughout the striatum. These high-resolution fMRI
   findings suggest that model-free aspects of reward learning in humans
   can be explained algorithmically with RL in terms of an actor/critic
   mechanism operating in parallel with a system for more direct
   action-value learning.}},

Abstract = {{We have a limited understanding of why many children with attention
   deficit hyperactivity disorder do not outgrow the disorder by adulthood.
   Around 20-30\% retain the full syndrome as young adults, and about 50\%
   show partial, rather than complete, remission. Here, to delineate the
   neurobiology of this variable outcome, we ask if the persistence of
   childhood symptoms into adulthood impacts on the brain's functional
   connectivity. We studied 205 participants followed clinically since
   childhood. In early adulthood, participants underwent
   magnetoencephalography (MEG) to measure neuronal activity directly and
   functional MRI (fMRI) to measure hemodynamic activity during a task-free
   period (the ``resting state{''}). We found that symptoms of inattention
   persisting into adulthood were associated with disrupted patterns of
   typical functional connectivity in both MEG and fMRI. Specifically,
   those with persistent inattention lost the typical balance of
   connections within the default mode network (DMN; prominent during
   introspective thought) and connections between this network and those
   supporting attention and cognitive control. By contrast, adults whose
   childhood inattentive symptoms had resolved did not differ significantly
   from their never-affected peers, both hemodynamically and
   electrophysiologically. The anomalies in functional connectivity tied to
   clinically significant inattention centered on midline regions of the
   DMN in both MEG and fMRI, boosting confidence in a possible
   pathophysiological role. The findings suggest that the clinical course
   of this common childhood onset disorder impacts the functional
   connectivity of the adult brain.}},

   a novel picture-based emotional go/no-go task with distracting emotional

   and 16 age-matched healthy controls. The faces displayed different
   emotional content (angry, neutral, or happy). Results showed differences
   in sensitivity between patients and the control group, with patients
   exhibiting less sensitivity in the task, and also showed influences of
   emotional content represented in the distracting faces in both groups.
   Specifically, happy faces decreased sensitivity compared to angry faces.
   It seemed as though processing of a positive emotional stimulus led to a
   more relaxed state and thereby to decreased sensitivity, while a
   negative emotional stimulus induced more alertness and tension, leading
   to higher sensitivity. Thus, this paradigm is suitable to investigate
   the interplay between emotion processing and impulse control in patients

Abstract = {{Although managing social information and decision making on the basis of
   reward is critical for survival, it remains uncertain whether differing
   reward type is processed in a uniform manner. Previously, we
   demonstrated that monetary reward and the social reward of good
   reputation activated the same striatal regions including the caudate
   nucleus and putamen. However, it remains unclear whether overlapping
   activations reflect activities of identical neuronal populations or two
   overlapping but functionally independent neuronal populations. Here, we
   re-analyzed the original data and addressed this question using
   multivariate-pattern-analysis and found evidence that in the left
   caudate nucleus and bilateral nucleus accumbens, social vs monetary
   reward were represented similarly. The findings suggest that social and
   monetary rewards are processed by the same population of neurons within
   these regions of the striatum. Additional findings demonstrated similar
   neural patterns when participants experience high social reward compared
   to viewing others receiving low social reward (potentially inducing
   schadenfreude). This is possibly an early indication that the same
   population of neurons may be responsible for processing two different
   types of social reward (good reputation and schadenfreude). These
   findings provide a supplementary perspective to previous research,
   helping to further elucidate the mechanisms behind social vs non-social
   reward processing.}},

Abstract = {{The hypothalamic peptide oxytocin (OT) is crucial in social adaptation
   and used to treat emotional and social deficits. Here, we conducted a
   systematic, quantitative meta-analysis of functional-MRI studies
   intranasally administering OT (IN-OT) to uncover neural substrates
   underlying the IN-OT effects and to elucidate differential IN-OT effects
   between healthy and clinical populations. Meta-analyses were conducted
   on 66 IN-OT fMRI studies, stratified by psychopathology, valence and
   sex. IN-OT increased bilateral amygdala, caudate head, and superior
   temporal activity in healthy individuals and increased dorsal anterior
   cingulate activity in patients. Moreover, IN-OT decreased amygdala
   activity in both patients and healthy individuals but did so to a
   greater degree in patients than healthy individuals. The OT-increased
   amygdala activity was only found on the negative social and affective
   processes, whereas the OT-decreased amygdala activity was mainly
   contributed by contrasts on negative-valenced processes. IN-OT increased
   parahippocampal activity and decreased amygdala activity during negative
   socio-affective processing. During positive socio-affective processes,
   IN-OT increased caudate head activity. This study indicates convergent
   neural substrates and the underlying neuropsychological mechanisms for
   IN-OT effects on social and affective processes. The common and
   different effects of IN-OT on patients and healthy individuals and the
   modulation of OT effects by valence have critical implications.}},

Abstract = {{Emotional intelligence (EI) is defined as an individual's capacity to
   accurately perceive, understand, reason about, and regulate emotions,
   and to apply that information to facilitate thought and achieve goals.
   Although EI plays an important role in mental health and success in
   academic, professional and social realms, the neurocircuitry underlying
   this capacity remains poorly characterized, and no study to date has yet
   examined the relationship between EI and intrinsic neural network
   function. Here, in a sample of 54 healthy individuals (28 women, 26
   men), we apply independent components analysis (ICA) with dual
   regression to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired
   while subjects were resting in the scanner to investigate brain circuits
   (intrinsic resting state networks) whose activity is associated with
   greater self-reported (i.e. Trait) and objectively measured (i.e.
   Ability) EI. We show that higher Ability EI, but not Trait EI, is
   associated with stronger negatively correlated spontaneous fMRI signals
   between the basal ganglia/limbic network (BGN) and posterior default
   mode network (DMN), and regions involved in emotional processing and
   regulation. Importantly, these findings suggest that the functional
   connectivity within and between intrinsic networks associated with
   mentation, affective regulation, emotion processing, and reward are
   strongly related to ability EI.}},

Abstract = {{The attitude towards one's own imperfection strongly varies between
   individuals. Here, we investigated variations in error related activity
   depending on two sub-traits of perfectionism, Personal Standard
   Perfectionism (PSP) and Evaluative Concern Perfectionism (ECP) in a
   large scale functional magnetic resonance imaging study (N = 75) using a
   digit-flanker task. Participants with higher PSP scores showed both more
   post-error slowing and more neural activity in the medial-frontal gyrus
   including anterior cingulate cortex after errors. Interestingly, high-EC
   perfectionists with low PSP showed no post-error slowing and the highest
   activity in the middle frontal gyrus, whereas high-EC perfectionists
   with high PSP showed the lowest activity in this brain area and more
   post-error slowing. Our findings are in line with the hypothesis that
   perfectionists with high concerns but low standards avoid performance
   monitoring to avoid the worry-inducing nature of detecting personal
   failure and the anticipation of poor evaluation by others. However, the
   stronger goal-oriented performance motivation of perfectionists with
   high concerns and high standards may have led to less avoidance of error
   processing and a more intense involvement with the imperfect behaviour,
   which is essential for improving future performance.}},

Abstract = {{Individual differences in the personality trait Agreeableness underlie
   humans' ability to interpret social cues and coordinate effectively with
   others. However, previous investigations of the neural basis of
   Agreeableness have yielded largely inconsistent results. Recent evidence
   has demonstrated that Agreeableness can be divided into two, correlated
   subdimensions. Compassion reflects tendencies toward empathy, sympathy,
   and concern for others, while Politeness reflects tendencies toward
   compliance and refraining from aggression and exploitation. The present
   study seeks to clarify the neural substrates of Agreeableness by
   examining whether structural differences in the brain show distinct
   associations with Compassion and Politeness. Results of a meta-analysis
   of fMRI studies examining empathy were used to generate hypotheses about
   the brain regions and networks that underlie trait Compassion. Results
   of a large-scale structural neuroimaging investigation (N = 275) were
   largely consistent with the meta-analysis: Compassion was positively
   correlated with gray matter volume in the bilateral anterior cingulate
   cortex (ACC) and anterior insula (AI). Further, these differences appear
   to be associated with Compassion specifically, as opposed to Politeness,
   suggesting that these two traits have at least partially distinct
   neuroanatomical substrates.}},

Abstract = {{Pre- or perinatally acquired ({''}congenital{''}) left-hemispheric brain
   lesions can be compensated for by reorganizing language into homotopic
   brain regions in the right hemisphere. Language comprehension may be
   hemispherically dissociated from language production. We investigated
   the lesion characteristics driving inter-hemispheric reorganization of
   language comprehension and language production in 19 patients (7-32
   years; eight females) with congenital left-hemispheric brain lesions
   (periventricular lesions In = 11] and middle cerebral artery infarctions
   {[}n = 8]) by fMRI. 16/17 patients demonstrated reorganized language
   production, while 7/19 patients had reorganized language comprehension.
   Lesions to the insular cortex and the temporo-parietal junction
   (predominantly supramarginal gyrus) were significantly more common in
   patients in whom both, language production and comprehension were
   reorganized. These areas belong to the dorsal stream of the language
   network, participating in the auditory-motor integration of language.
   Our data suggest that the integrity of this stream might be crucial for
   a normal left-lateralized language development. (C) 2017 Published by

Title = {{Aversive smell associations shape social judgment}},

Abstract = {{Once associating another person with an unpleasant smell, how do we
   perceive and judge this person from that moment on? Here, we used
   aversive olfactory conditioning followed by a social attribution task
   during functional magnetic resonance imaging to address this question.
   After conditioning, where one of two faces was repeatedly paired with an
   aversive smell, the participants reported negative affect when viewing
   the smell-conditioned but not the neutral face. When subsequently
   confronted with the smell-conditioned face (without any smell), the
   participants tended to judge both positive and negative behaviors as
   indicative of personality traits rather than related to the situation.
   This effect was predicted by the degree of the preceding olfactory
   evaluative conditioning. Whole brain analysis of stimulus by stage
   interaction indicated differential activation of the ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex and right angular gyrus to the conditioned versus the
   neutral person during the attribution phase only. These results suggest
   that negative smell associations do not simply induce a negative
   perception of the target person but rather bias the attribution style
   towards trait attributions. The fact that this bias was evident
   regardless of behavior valence suggests it may reflect enhanced
   psychological distance. Thus, the known observation of social rejection
   triggered by aversive smell may be driven by a shift in social
   attribution style. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Although several studies suggest heritability of ADHD, only a
   few investigations of possible associations between people at risk and
   neural abnormalities in ADHD exist. In this study, we tested whether
   parents of children with ADHD would show atypical patterns of cerebral
   activations during forethought, a feature of working memory. Method:
   Using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), we compared 12
   parents of children with ADHD and 9 parents of control children during a
   forethought task. Results: Parents of children with ADHD exhibited
   significantly increased neural activations in the posterior lobes of the
   cerebellum and in the left inferior frontal gyrus, relative to parents
   of control children. Conclusion: These findings are consistent with
   previous reports in children and suggest the fronto-cerebellar circuit's
   abnormalities during forethought in parents of children with ADHD.
   Future studies of people at risk of ADHD are needed to fully understand
   the extent of the fronto-cerebellar heritability.}},

Title = {{Comparison of neural substrates of temporal discounting between youth

Abstract = {{Background. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and obsessive-compulsive
   disorder (OCD) share abnormalities in hot executive functions such as
   reward-based decision-making, as measured in the temporal discounting
   task (TD). No studies, however, have directly compared these disorders
   to investigate common/distinct neural profiles underlying such
   abnormalities. We wanted to test whether reward-based decision-making is
   a shared transdiagnostic feature of both disorders with similar
   neurofunctional substrates or whether it is a shared phenotype with
   disorder-differential neurofunctional underpinnings.
   Methods. Age and IQ-matched boys with ASD (N= 20), with OCD (N= 20) and
   20 healthy controls, performed an individually-adjusted functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) TD task. Brain activation and
   performance were compared between groups.
   Results. Boys with ASD showed greater choice-impulsivity than OCD and
   control boys. Whole-brain between-group comparison revealed shared
   reductions in ASD and OCD relative to control boys for delayed-immediate
   choices in right ventromedial/lateral orbitofrontal cortex extending
   intomedial/inferior prefrontal cortex, and in cerebellum, posterior
   cingulate and precuneus. For immediate-delayed choices, patients
   relative to controls showed reduced activation in anterior
   cingulate/ventromedial prefrontal cortex reaching into left caudate,
   which, at a trend level, was more decreased in ASD than OCD patients,
   and in bilateral temporal and inferior parietal regions.
   Conclusions. This first fMRI comparison between youth with ASD and with
   OCD, using a reward-based decision-making task, shows predominantly
   shared neurofunctional abnormalities during TD in key ventromedial,
   orbital-and inferior fronto-striatal, temporo-parietal and cerebellar
   regions of temporal foresight and reward processing, suggesting
   trans-diagnostic neurofunctional deficits.}},

Abstract = {{Recent work with noninvasive human brain imaging has started to
   investigate the effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on
   large-scale patterns of brain activity. MDMA, a potent
   monoamine-releaser with particularly pronounced serotonin-releasing
   properties, has unique subjective effects that include: marked positive
   mood, pleasant/unusual bodily sensations and pro-social, empathic
   feelings. However, the neurobiological basis for these effects is not
   properly understood, and the present analysis sought to address this
   knowledge gap. To do this, we administered MDMA-HCl (100 mg p.o.) and,
   separately, placebo (ascorbic acid) in a randomized, double-blind,
   repeated-measures design with twenty-five healthy volunteers undergoing
   fMRI scanning. We then employed a measure of global resting-state
   functional brain connectivity and follow-up seed-to-voxel analysis to
   the fMRI data we acquired. Results revealed decreased right
   insula/salience network functional connectivity under MDMA. Furthermore,
   these decreases in right insula/salience network connectivity correlated
   with baseline trait anxiety and acute experiences of altered bodily
   sensations under MDMA. The present findings highlight insular
   disintegration (ie, compromised salience network membership) as a
   neurobiological signature of the MDMA experience, and relate this brain
   effect to trait anxiety and acutely altered bodily sensations-both of
   which are known to be associated with insular functioning.}},

Title = {{Altered intrinsic functional connectivity in the latent period of
   epileptogenesis in a temporal lobe epilepsy model}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{296}},
Pages = {{89-98}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The latent period, a seizure-free phase, is the duration between brain
   injury and the onset of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs) during
   epileptogenesis. The latent period is thought to involve several
   progressive pathophysiological events that lead to the evolution of the
   chronic epilepsy phase. Hence, it is vital to investigate the changes in
   the latent period during epileptogenesis in order to better understand
   temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), and to achieve early diagnosis and
   appropriate management of the condition. Accordingly, recent studies
   with patients with TLE using resting-state functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (rs-fMRI) have reported that alterations of resting -state
   functional connectivity (rsFC) during the chronic period are associated
   with some clinical manifestations, including learning and memory
   impairments, emotional instability, and social behavior deficits, in
   addition to repetitive seizure episodes. In contrast, the changes in the
   intrinsic rsFC during epileptogenesis, particularly during the latent
   period, remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the alterations
   in intrinsic rsFC during the latent and chronic periods in a
   pilocarpine-induced TLE mouse model using intrinsic optical signal
   imaging (IOSI). This technique can monitor the changes in the local
   hemoglobin concentration according to neuronal activity and can help
   investigate large-scale brain intrinsic networks. After seeding on the
   anatomical regions of interest (ROIs) and calculating the correlation
   coefficients between each ROI, we established and compared functional
   correlation matrices and functional connectivity maps during the latent
   and chronic periods of epilepsy. We found a decrease in the
   interhemispheric rsFC at the frontal and temporal regions during both
   the latent and chronic periods. Furthermore, a significant decrease in
   the interhemispheric rsFC was observed in the somatosensory area during
   the chronic period. Changes in network configurations during
   epileptogenesis were examined by graph theoretical network analysis.
   Interestingly, increase in the power of low frequency oscillations was
   observed during the latent period. These results suggest that, even if
   there are no apparent ictal seizure events during the latent period,
   there are ongoing changes in the rsFC in the epileptic brain.
   Furthermore, these results suggest that the pathophysiology of epilepsy
   may be related to widespread altered intrinsic functional connectivity.
   These findings can help enhance our understanding of epileptogenesis,
   and accordingly, changes in intrinsic functional connectivity can serve
   as an early diagnosis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{BRAIN AND COGNITION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{117}},
Pages = {{57-64}},

Abstract = {{In typical adults, fMRI studies have shown activation of primary and
   pre-motor regions during action word processing. Autism spectrum
   disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social
   and communication impairments. ASD studies have shown atypical semantic
   processing and motor deficits. The objective of this study was to
   examine semantic processing of verbs in ASD. 15 ASD adolescents and 19
   typically developing adolescents, 11-16 years, completed a semantic
   similarity judgment task during fMRI. There were no differences in task
   accuracy or reaction time. At the group level, both groups had
   activation in left language areas; controls, but not ASD, also had
   activation in the left pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA). In ASD,
   less left frontal activation and reduced left lateralization of
   activation within these regions was associated with shorter reaction
   times and better language skills. More left temporal activation was
   associated with better language abilities in ASD. Differences in pre-SMA
   activation may relate to motor planning deficits or differences in
   approach to the semantic task in ASD. Results suggest that left frontal
   language areas may be less efficient in ASD and those who can compensate
   by recruiting more right hemisphere homologues may result in better
   language abilities.}},

Abstract = {{Citizen trust and distrust perceptions have become an increasingly
   controversial problem in recent election turmoil regarding changes in
   governance. Key to this trust and distrust problem is that the physical
   perception process in the human brain is still not well understood. The
   ongoing trust and distrust debate in organizational literature was
   researched seeking a resolution. The framework of this debate argues
   whether trust and distrust are separate dimensions or merely opposite
   ends of a single continuum. Because the human perception neural binding
   process is so little understood, the debate has remained in the argument
   stage of how trust and distrust should be defined. This led the research
   exploration to examine the Artificial Intelligence (Al) community's
   development of computers that mimic cognitive functions of humans. Al
   includes a multi-sensory data gathering and binding architecture that
   mimics the human neural multi-sensory data gathering and binding neural
   signals for people to perceive a conscious awareness of the world around
   them. This sensory fusion architecture was used in the exploration
   research to create a map to match the human neural multi-sensory binding
   phases. The Al computer developers used fMRI research to test the
   credibility of their system with human participants. They identified
   that trust and distrust each activate separate correlative sections of
   the brain. This paper proceeds to examines how the perceptions of trust
   and distrust are used by people to develop their organization of
   self-governance of their social behavior, as individuals, as social
   groups, and as citizens' especially the self-governance of their
   political governments. However, when both trust and distrust perceptions
   are at extreme force, they can become fused into one. The results come
   often at the expense of most of the people involved, as described in the
   Polybius' Cycle Governments.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate how hearing status, sign language experience, and task
   demands influence functional responses in the human superior temporal
   cortices (STC) we collected fMRI data from deaf and hearing participants
   (male and female), who either acquired sign language early or late in
   life. Our stimuli in all tasks were pictures of objects. We varied the
   linguistic and visuospatial processing demands in three different tasks
   that involved decisions about (1) the sublexical (phonological)
   structure of the British Sign Language (BSL) signs for the objects, (2)
   the semantic category of the objects, and (3) the physical features of
   the objects.
   Neuroimaging data revealed that in participants who were deaf from
   birth, STC showed increased activation during visual processing tasks.
   Importantly, this differed across hemispheres. Right STC was
   consistently activated regardless of the task whereas left STC was
   sensitive to task demands. Significant activation was detected in the
   left STC only for the BSL phonological task. This task, we argue, placed
   greater demands on visuospatial processing than the other two tasks. In
   hearing signers, enhanced activation was absent in both left and right
   STC during all three tasks. Lateralization analyses demonstrated that
   the effect of deafness was more task-dependent in the left than the
   right STC whereas it was more task-independent in the right than the
   left STC. These findings indicate how the absence of auditory input from
   birth leads to dissociable and altered functions of left and right STC
   in deaf participants.}},

Abstract = {{Age and sleep both affect emotional functioning. Since sleep patterns
   change over the lifespan, we investigated the effects of short sleep and
   age on empathic responses. In a randomized cross-over experimental
   design, healthy young and older volunteers (n = 47 aged 20-30 years and
   n = 39 aged 65-75 years) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) after normal sleep or night sleep restricted to 3 hours. During
   fMRI, participants viewed pictures of needles pricking a hand (pain) or
   Q-tips touching a hand (control), a well-established paradigm to
   investigate empathy for pain. There was no main effect of sleep
   restriction on empathy. However, age and sleep interacted so that sleep
   restriction caused increased unpleasantness in older but not in young
   participants. Irrespective of sleep condition, older participants showed
   increased activity in angular gyrus, superior temporal sulcus and
   temporo-parietal junction compared to young. Speculatively, this could
   indicate that the older individuals adopted a more cognitive approach in
   response to others' pain. Our findings suggest that caution in
   generalizability across age groups is needed in further studies of sleep
   on social cognition and emotion.}},

Title = {{College Binge Drinking Associated with Decreased Frontal Activation to
   Negative Emotional Distractors during Inhibitory Control}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{SEP 22}},
Abstract = {{The transition to college is associated with an increase in heavy
   episodic alcohol use, or binge drinking, during a time when the
   prefrontal cortex and prefrontal-limbic circuitry continue to mature.
   Traits associated with this immaturity, including impulsivity in
   emotional contexts, may contribute to risky and heavy episodic alcohol
   consumption. The current study used blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD)
   multiband functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess brain
   activation during a task that required participants to ignore background
   images with positive, negative, or neutral emotional valence while
   performing an inhibitory control task (Go-NoGo). Subjects were 23
   college freshmen (seven male, 18-20 years) who engaged in a range of
   drinking behavior (past 3 months' binge episodes range = 0-19, mean D
   4.6, total drinks consumed range = 0-104, mean = 32.0). Brain activation
   on inhibitory trials (NoGo) was contrasted between negative and neutral
   conditions and between positive and neutral conditions using
   non-parametric testing (5000 permutations) and clusterbased thresholding
   (z = 2.3), p <= 0.05 corrected. Results showed that a higher recent
   incidence of binge drinking was significantly associated with decreased
   activation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), dorsomedial
   prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), brain
   regions strongly implicated in executive functioning, during negative
   relative to neutral inhibitory trials. No significant associations
   between binge drinking and brain activation were observed for positive
   relative to neutral images. While task performance was not significantly
   associated with binge drinking in this sample, subjects with heavier
   recent binge drinking showed decreased recruitment of executive control
   regions under negative versus neutral distractor conditions. These
   findings suggest that in young adults with heavier recent binge
   drinking, processing of negative emotional images interferes more with
   inhibitory control neurocircuitry than in young adults who do not binge
   drink often. This pattern of altered frontal lobe activation associated
   with binge drinking may serve as an early marker of risk for future
   self-regulation deficits that could lead to problematic alcohol use.
   These findings underscore the importance of understanding the impact of
   emotion on cognitive control and associated brain functioning in binge
   drinking behaviors among young adults.}},

Title = {{Human agency beliefs influence behaviour during virtual social
   interactions}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP 20}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, with the emergence of relatively inexpensive and
   accessible virtual reality technologies, it is now possible to deliver
   compelling and realistic simulations of human-to-human interaction.
   Neuroimaging studies have shown that, when participants believe they are
   interacting via a virtual interface with another human agent, they show
   different patterns of brain activity compared to when they know that
   their virtual partner is computer-controlled. The suggestion is that
   users adopt an ``intentional stance'' by attributing mental states to
   their virtual partner. However, it remains unclear how beliefs in the
   agency of a virtual partner influence participants' behaviour and
   subjective experience of the interaction. We investigated this issue in
   the context of a cooperative ``joint attention'' game in which
   participants interacted via an eye tracker with a virtual onscreen
   partner, directing each other's eye gaze to different screen locations.
   Half of the participants were correctly informed that their partner was
   controlled by a computer algorithm ({''}Computer'' condition). The other
   half were misled into believing that the virtual character was
   controlled by a second participant in another room ({''}Human''
   condition). Those in the ``Human'' condition were slower to make eye
   contact with their partner and more likely to try and guide their
   partner before they had established mutual eye contact than participants
   in the ``Computer'' condition. They also responded more rapidly when
   their partner was guiding them, although the same effect was also found
   for a control condition in which they responded to an arrow cue. Results
   confirm the influence of human agency beliefs on behaviour in this
   virtual social interaction context. They further suggest that
   researchers and developers attempting to simulate social interactions
   should consider the impact of agency beliefs on user experience in other
   social contexts, and their effect on the achievement of the
   application's goals.}},

Title = {{Phonological memory in sign language relies on the visuomotor neural
   system outside the left hemisphere language network}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 20}},
Abstract = {{Sign language is an essential medium for everyday social interaction for
   deaf people and plays a critical role in verbal learning. In particular,
   language development in those people should heavily rely on the verbal
   short-term memory (STM) via sign language. Most previous studies
   compared neural activations during signed language processing in deaf
   signers and those during spoken language processing in hearing speakers.
   For sign language users, it thus remains unclear how visuospatial inputs
   are converted into the verbal STM operating in the left-hemisphere
   language network. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the
   present study investigated neural activation while bilinguals of spoken
   and signed language were engaged in a sequence memory span task. On each
   trial, participants viewed a nonsense syllable sequence presented either
   as written letters or as fingerspelling (4-7 syllables in length) and
   then held the syllable sequence for 12 s. Behavioral analysis revealed
   that participants relied on phonological memory while holding verbal
   information regardless of the type of input modality. At the neural
   level, this maintenance stage broadly activated the left-hemisphere
   language network, including the inferior frontal gyrus, supplementary
   motor area, superior temporal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule, for
   both letter and fingerspelling conditions. Interestingly, while most
   participants reported that they relied on phonological memory during
   maintenance, direct comparisons between letters and fingers revealed
   strikingly different patterns of neural activation during the same
   period. Namely, the effortful maintenance of fingerspelling inputs
   relative to letter inputs activated the left superior parietal lobule
   and dorsal premotor area, i.e., brain regions known to play a role in
   visuomotor analysis of hand/arm movements. These findings suggest that
   the dorsal visuomotor neural system subserves verbal learning via sign
   language by relaying gestural inputs to the classical left-hemisphere
   language network.}},

Journal = {{ELIFE}},

Month = {{SEP 16}},
Abstract = {{The existence of abnormal connectivity patterns between resting state
   networks in neuropsychiatric disorders, including Autism Spectrum
   Disorder (ASD), has been well established. Traditional treatment methods
   in ASD are limited, and do not address the aberrant network structure.
   Using real-time fMRI neurofeedback, we directly trained three brain
   nodes in participants with ASD, in which the aberrant connectivity has
   been shown to correlate with symptom severity. Desired network
   connectivity patterns were reinforced in real-time, without
   participants' awareness of the training taking place. This training
   regimen produced large, significant long-term changes in correlations at
   the network level, and whole brain analysis revealed that the greatest
   changes were focused on the areas being trained. These changes were not
   found in the control group. Moreover, changes in ASD resting state
   connectivity following the training were correlated to changes in
   behavior, suggesting that neurofeedback can be used to directly alter
   complex, clinically relevant network connectivity patterns.}},

Title = {{Low threshold unmyelinated mechanoafferents can modulate pain}},
Journal = {{BMC NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Human, hairy skin contains a subgroup of C-fibers, the C-low
   threshold mechanoreceptive afferents ((C-LTMR) C-tactile or C-touch (CT)
   fibers) that are linked with the signaling of affective aspects of human
   touch. Recent studies suggest an involvement of these afferents in the
   modulation of pain in healthy volunteers. Small fiber neuropathy (SFN)
   is associated with a damage of C-fibers. Therefore, an impairment of
   C-LTMRs can be assumed. We aimed to elaborate a possible role of
   CT-afferents in pain modulation by investigating healthy volunteers and
   SFN-patients.
   Methods: Experiment I: 20 SFN-patients (12 women, median age 52.0 years)
   and 20 healthy controls (14 women, median age 43.0 years) participated
   in this prospective fMRI and psychophysical study. Heat-pain (HP),
   CT-targeted touch (slow brushing) and HP combined with CT-targeted touch
   were applied in randomized order to the left shank in a block design.
   The participants rated pain intensity on a visual analogue scale.
   Experiment II: We investigated a possible impact of pain intensity on CT
   induced pain modulation (10 healthy participants). The intensity of HP
   stimulation was chosen to induce pain intensity 50/100 (NRS). HP
   stimulation was applied with and without CT-targeted touch.
   Results: Experiment I: CT-stimulation was sufficient to reduce heat pain
   in healthy participants (p = 0.016), but not in SFN-patients. HP induced
   pain intensity was significantly higher (32,2 vs 52,6) in SFN-patients.
   During HP, bold responses in pain associated areas were observed in both
   groups. Additional CT-stimulation elicited no significant difference of
   bold responses compared to HP. Experiment II: In healthy volunteers, we
   reproduced a significant reduction of HP intensity by CT-stimulation (p
   = 0.038).
   Conclusions: CT input seems to be sufficient to modulate pain,
   independent of intensity of the pain stimulus. As a prerequisite, the CT
   fibers have to be intact as in healthy volunteers. If CT fibers are
   impaired -as in SFN-, CT-targeted touch does not modulate pain
   intensity. The location of CT-induced pain modulation might be
   attributed to the level of the dorsal horn since the cortical activation
   pattern of heat pain with and without CT-targeted touch did not differ
   in healthy subjects and in SFN-patients.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Variational Bayes (VB), variational maximum likelihood (VML), restricted
   maximum likelihood (ReML), and maximum likelihood (ML) are cornerstone
   parametric statistical estimation techniques in the analysis of
   functional neuroimaging data. However, the theoretical underpinnings of
   these model parameter estimation techniques are rarely covered in
   introductory statistical texts. Because of the widespread practical use
   of VB, VML, ReML, and ML in the neuroimaging community, we reasoned that
   a theoretical treatment of their relationships and their application in
   a basic modeling scenario may be helpful for both neuroimaging novices
   and practitioners alike. In this technical study, we thus revisit the
   conceptual and formal underpinnings of VB, VML, ReML, and ML and provide
   a detailed account of their mathematical relationships and
   implementational details. We further apply VB, VML, ReML, and ML to the
   general linear model (GLM) with non -spherical error covariance as
   commonly encountered in the first-level analysis of fMRI data. To this
   end, we explicitly derive the corresponding free energy objective
   functions and ensuing iterative algorithms. Finally, in the applied part
   of our study, we evaluate the parameter and model recovery properties of
   VB, VML, ReML, and ML, first in an exemplary setting and then in the
   analysis of experimental fMRI data acquired from a single participant
   under visual stimulation.}},

Title = {{Alterations of Brain Functional Architecture Associated with
   Psychopathic Traits in Male Adolescents with Conduct Disorder}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{SEP 12}},
Abstract = {{Psychopathic traits of conduct disorder (CD) have a core
   callous-unemotional (CU) component and an impulsive-antisocial
   component. Previous task-driven fMRI studies have suggested that
   psychopathic traits are associated with dysfunction of several brain
   areas involved in different cognitive functions (e.g., empathy, reward,
   and response inhibition etc.), but the relationship between psychopathic
   traits and intrinsic brain functional architecture has not yet been
   explored in CD. Using a holistic brain-wide functional connectivity
   analysis, this study delineated the alterations in brain functional
   networks in patients with conduct disorder. Compared with matched
   healthy controls, we found decreased anti-synchronization between the
   fronto-parietal network (FPN) and default mode network (DMN), and
   increased intra-network synchronization within the frontothalamic-basal
   ganglia, right frontoparietal, and temporal/limbic/visual networks in CD
   patients. Correlation analysis showed that the weakened FPN-DMN
   interaction was associated with CU traits, while the heightened
   intra-network functional connectivity was related to impulsivity traits
   in CD patients. Our findings suggest that decoupling of cognitive
   control (FPN) with social understanding of others (DMN) is associated
   with the CU traits, and hyper-functions of the reward and motor
   inhibition systems elevate impulsiveness in CD.}},

   Face-Vase Illusion}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{SEP 12}},
Abstract = {{When viewing the Rubin face-vase illusion, our conscious perception
   spontaneously alternates between the face and the vase; this illusion
   has been widely used to explore bistable perception. Previous functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have studied the neural
   mechanisms underlying bistable perception through univariate and
   multivariate pattern analyses; however, no studies have investigated the
   issue of category selectivity. Here, we used fMRI to investigate the
   neural mechanisms underlying the Rubin face-vase illusion by introducing
   univariate amplitude and multivariate pattern analyses. The results from
   the amplitude analysis suggested that the activity in the fusiform face
   area was likely related to the subjective face perception. Furthermore,
   the pattern analysis results showed that the early visual cortex (EVC)
   and the faceselective cortex could discriminate the activity patterns of
   the face and vase perceptions. However, further analysis of the activity
   patterns showed that only the face-selective cortex contains the face
   information. These findings indicated that although the EVC and
   face-selective cortex activities could discriminate the visual
   information, only the activity and activity pattern in the
   face-selective areas contained the category information of face
   perception in the Rubin face-vase illusion.}},

Title = {{Moral judgment modulation by disgust priming via altered fronto-temporal
   functional connectivity}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{SEP 7}},
Abstract = {{Moral judgments are not just the product of conscious reasoning, but
   also involve the integration of social and emotional information.
   Irrelevant disgust stimuli modulate moral judgments, with individual
   sensitivity determining the direction and size of effects across both
   hypothetical and incentive-compatible experimental designs. We
   investigated the neural circuitry underlying this modulation using fMRI
   in 19 individuals performing a moral judgment task with subliminal
   priming of disgust facial expressions. Our results indicate that
   individual changes in moral acceptability due to priming covaried with
   individual differences in activation within the dorsomedial prefrontal
   cortex (dmPFC). Further, whole-brain analyses identified changes in
   functional connectivity between the dmPFC and the temporal-parietal
   junction (TPJ). High sensitivity individuals showed enhanced functional
   connectivity between the TPJ and dmPFC, corresponding with deactivation
   in the dmPFC, and rating the moral dilemmas as more acceptable. Low
   sensitivity individuals showed the opposite pattern of results.
   Post-hoc, these findings replicated in the dorsal anterior cingulate
   cortex (daMCC), an adjacent region implicated in converting between
   objective and subjective valuation. This suggests a specific
   computational mechanism - that disgust stimuli modulate moral judgments
   by altering the integration of social information to determine the
   subjective valuation of the considered moral actions.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective for obsessive compulsive
   disorder (OCD); however, little is understood about its mechanisms
   related to brain network connectivity. We examined connectivity changes
   from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data
   pre-to-post-CBT in 43 OCD participants, randomized to receive either 4
   weeks of intensive CBT or 4 weeks waitlist followed by 4 weeks of CBT,
   and 24 healthy controls before and after 4 weeks of no treatment.
   Network-based-statistic analysis revealed large-magnitude increases in
   OCD connectivity in eight networks. Strongest increases involved
   connectivity between the cerebellum and caudate/putamen, and between the
   cerebellum and dorsolateral/ventrolateral prefrontal cortices.
   Connectivity increases were associated with increased resistance to
   compulsions. Mechanisms of CBT may involve enhanced cross-network
   integration, both within and outside of classical
   cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical regions; those involving cerebellar to
   striatal and prefrontal regions may reflect acquisition of new
   non-compulsive goal-directed behaviors and thought patterns. Our
   findings have implications for identifying targets for enhancing
   treatment efficacy and monitoring treatment progress.}},

   Social Motivation}},
Journal = {{ENEURO}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{4}},

Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{Large-scale functional networks, as identified through the coordinated
   activity of spatially distributed brain regions, have become central
   objects of study in neuroscience because of their contributions to many
   processing domains. Yet, it remains unclear how these domain-general
   networks interact with focal brain regions to coordinate thought and
   action. Here, we investigated how the default-mode network (DMN) and
   executive control network (ECN), two networks associated with
   goal-directed behavior, shape task performance through their coupling
   with other cortical regions several seconds in advance of behavior. We
   measured these networks' connectivity during an adaptation of the
   monetary incentive delay (MID) response-time task in which human
   participants viewed social and nonsocial images (i.e., pictures of faces
   and landscapes, respectively) while brain activity was measured using
   fMRI. We found that participants displayed slower reaction times (RTs)
   subsequent to social trials relative to nonsocial trials. To examine the
   neural mechanisms driving this subsequent-RT effect, we integrated
   independent components analysis (ICA) and a network-based
   psychophysiological interaction (nPPI)analysis; this allowed us to
   investigate task-related changes in network coupling that preceded the
   observed trial-to-trial variation in RT. Strikingly, when subjects
   viewed social rewards, an area of the fusiform gyrus (FG) consistent
   with the functionally-defined fusiform face area (FFA) exhibited
   increased coupling with the ECN (relative to the DMN), and the relative
   magnitude of coupling tracked the slowing of RT on the following trial.
   These results demonstrate how large-scale, domain-general networks can
   interact with focal, domain-specific cortical regions to orchestrate
   subsequent behavior.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Graph theoretical analysis of functional Magnetic
   Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data has provided new measures of mapping human
   brain in vivo. Of all methods to measure the functional connectivity
   between regions, Linear Correlation (LC) calculation of activity time
   series of the brain regions as a linear measure is considered the most
   ubiquitous one. The strength of the dependence obligatory for graph
   construction and analysis is consistently underestimated by LC, because
   not all the bivariate distributions, but only the marginals are
   Gaussian. In a number of studies, Mutual Information (MI) has been
   employed, as a similarity measure between each two time series of the
   brain regions, a pure nonlinear measure. Owing to the complex fractal
   organization of the brain indicating self-similarity, more information
   on the brain can be revealed by fMRI Fractal Dimension (FD) analysis.
   Methods: In the present paper, Box-Counting Fractal Dimension (BCFD) is
   introduced for graph theoretical analysis of fMRI data in 17
   methamphetamine drug users and 18 normal controls. Then, BCFD
   performance was evaluated compared to those of LC and MI methods.
   Moreover, the global topological graph properties of the brain networks
   inclusive of global efficiency, clustering coefficient and
   characteristic path length in addict subjects were investigated too.
   Results: Compared to normal subjects by using statistical tests
   (P<0.05), topological graph properties were postulated to be disrupted
   significantly during the resting-state fMRI.
   Conclusion: Based on the results, analyzing the graph topological
   properties (representing the brain networks) based on BCFD is a more
   reliable method than LC and MI.}},

Abstract = {{Many psychiatric disorders are characterized by altered social
   cognition. The importance of social cognition has previously been
   recognized by the National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain
   Criteria project, in which it features as a core domain. Social
   task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) currently offers
   the most direct insight into how the brain processes social information;
   however, resting-state fMRI may be just as important in understanding
   the biology and network nature of social processing. Resting-state fMRI
   allows researchers to investigate the functional relationships between
   brain regions in a neutral state: so-called resting functional
   connectivity (RFC). There is evidence that RFC is predictive of how the
   brain processes information during social tasks. This is important
   because it shifts the focus from possibly context-dependent aberrations
   to context-independent aberrations in functional network architecture.
   Rather than being analysed in isolation, the study of resting-state
   brain networks shows promise in linking results of task-based fMRI
   results, structural connectivity, molecular imaging findings, and
   performance measures of social cognition-which may prove crucial in
   furthering our understanding of the social brain.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The aim of this study was to determine in pre- and
   postsurgical fMRI studies the rearrangement of the Broca's and
   Wernicke's areas and the lateralization index for these areas in
   patients with brain tumors located near speech centers. Impact of the
   surgical treatment on the brain plasticity was evaluated.
   Materials and methods: Pre-and postoperative fMRI examinations were
   performed in 10 patients with low grade glial, left-sided brain tumors
   located close to the Broca's (5 patients) or Wernicke's area (5
   patients). BOLD signal was recorded in regions of interest: Broca's and
   Wernicke's areas, and their anatomic right-sided homologues.
   Results: In the preoperative fMRI study the left Broca's area was
   activated in all cases. The right Broca's area was activated in all the
   patients with no speech disorders. In the postoperative fMRI the
   activation of both Broca's areas increased in two cases. In other two
   cases activation of one of the Broca's area increased along with the
   decrease in the contralateral hemisphere. In all patients with temporal
   lobe tumors, the right Wernicke's area was activated in the pre- and
   postsurgical fMRI. After the operation, in two patients with speech
   disorder, the activation of both Broca's areas decreased and the
   activation of one of the Wernicke's areas increased.
   Conclusions: In the cases of tumors localized near the left Broca's
   area, a transfer of the function to the healthy hemisphere seems to take
   place. Resection of tumors located near Broca's or Wernicke's areas may
   lead to relocation of the brain language centers. (C) 2017 Polish

Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{104}},
Pages = {{214-222}},

Abstract = {{There has been great interest in characterizing the response of the
   amygdala to emotional faces, especially in the context of social
   cognition. Although amygdala activation is most often associated with
   fearful or angry stimuli, there is considerable evidence that the
   response of the amygdala to neutral faces is both robust and reliable.
   This characteristic of amygdala function is of particular interest in
   the context of assessing populations with executive function deficits,
   such as traumatic brain injuries, which can be evaluated using fMRI
   attention modulation tasks that evaluate prefrontal control over
   representations, notably faces. The current study tested the hypothesis
   that the amygdala may serve as a marker of selective attention to
   neutral faces. Using fMRI, we gathered data within a chronic traumatic
   brain injury population. Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal
   change within the left and right amygdalae and fusiform face areas was
   measured while participants viewed neutral faces and scenes, under
   conditions requiring participants to (1) categorize pictures of faces
   and scenes, (2) selectively attend to either faces or scenes, or (3)
   attend to both faces and scenes. Findings revealed that the amygdala is
   an effective marker for selective attention to neutral faces and,
   furthermore, it was more face-specific than the fusiform face area.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge about interactions between reward and negative processing is
   rudimentary. Here, we employed functional MRI to probe how potential
   reward signaled by advance cues alters aversive distractor processing
   during perception. Behaviorally, the influence of aversive stimuli on
   task performance was reduced during the reward compared to no-reward
   condition. In the brain, at the task phase, paralleling the observed
   behavioral pattern, we observed significant interactions in the anterior
   insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, such that responses during
   the negative (vs neutral) condition were reduced during the reward
   compared to no-reward condition. Notably, negative distractor processing
   in the amygdala appeared to be independent of the reward manipulation.
   During the initial cue phase, we observed increased reward-related
   responses in the ventral striatum/accumbens, which were correlated with
   behavioral interference scores at the subsequent task phase, revealing
   that participants with increased reward-related responses exhibited a
   greater behavioral benefit of reward in reducing the adverse effect of
   negative images. Furthermore, during processing of reward (vs no-reward)
   cues, the ventral striatum exhibited stronger functional connectivity
   with fronto-parietal regions important for attentional control.
   Together, our findings contribute to the understanding of how potential
   reward influences attentional control and reduces negative distractor
   processing in the human brain.}},

Abstract = {{Affect labeling (putting feelings into words) is a form of incidental
   emotion regulation that could underpin some benefits of expressive
   writing (i.e. writing about negative experiences). Here, we show that
   neural responses during affect labeling predicted changes in
   psychological and physical well-being outcome measures 3 months later.
   Furthermore, neural activity of specific frontal regions and amygdala
   predicted those outcomes as a function of expressive writing. Using
   supervised learning (support vector machines regression), improvements
   in four measures of psychological and physical health (physical
   symptoms, depression, anxiety and life satisfaction) after an expressive
   writing intervention were predicted with an average of 0.85\% prediction
   error {[}root mean square error (RMSE) \%]. The predictions were
   significantly more accurate with machine learning than with the
   conventional generalized linear model method (average RMSE: 1.3\%).
   Consistent with affect labeling research, right ventrolateral prefrontal
   cortex (RVLPFC) and amygdalae were top predictors of improvement in the
   four outcomes. Moreover, RVLPFC and left amygdala predicted benefits due
   to expressive writing in satisfaction with life and depression outcome
   measures, respectively. This study demonstrates the substantial merit of
   supervised machine learning for real-world outcome prediction in social
   and affective neuroscience.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing emotional dynamics in the brain offers insight into the
   fundamental neural and psychological mechanisms underlying emotion. One
   such dynamic is emotional inertia-the influence of one's emotional state
   at one time point on one's emotional state at a subsequent time point.
   Emotion inertia reflects emotional rigidity and poor emotion regulation
   as evidenced by its relationship to depression and neuroticism. In this
   study, we assessed changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) from before to
   after an emotional task and used these changes to predict stress,
   positive and negative emotional inertia in daily life events. Cerebral
   blood flow changes in the lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) predicted
   decreased non-specific emotional inertia, suggesting that the lPFC may
   feature a general inhibitory mechanism responsible for limiting the
   impact that an emotional state from one event has on the emotional state
   of a subsequent event. CBF changes in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
   and lateral occipital cortex were associated with positive emotional
   inertia and negative/stress inertia, respectively. These data advance
   the blossoming literature on the temporal dynamics of emotion in the
   brain and on the use of neural indices to predict mental health-relevant
   behavior in daily life.}},

Abstract = {{Having a depressed mother is one of the strongest predictors for
   developing depression in adolescence. Given the role of aberrant reward
   processing in the onset and maintenance of depression, we examined the
   association between mothers' and their daughters' neural response to the
   anticipation of reward and loss. Fifteen non-depressed mothers with a
   history of recurrent depression and their never-disordered daughters,
   and 23 mothers without past or current depression and their
   never-disordered daughters, underwent functional magnetic resonance
   imaging while performing the monetary incentive delay task. To assess
   mother-daughter concordance, we first identified ROIs involved in the
   anticipation of reward and loss across all mother-daughter pairs. Within
   each of these ROIs, we examined the association between mothers' and
   daughters' neural response, and the interaction between group status and
   mothers' neural response in predicting daughters' neural response. We
   found a significant association between mothers' and daughters' putamen
   response to the anticipation of loss, regardless of mother's depression
   history. Furthermore, pubertal stage moderated the association between
   mother-daughter putamen concordance. Our findings suggest a unique role
   of the putamen in the maternal transmission of reward learning and have
   important implications for understanding disorders characterized by
   disturbances in reward learning and processing, such as major
   depression.}},

Abstract = {{Pedophilia is a sexual preference that is often associated with child
   sex offending (CSO). Sexual urges towards prepubescent children and
   specifically acting upon those urges are universally regarded as
   immoral. However, up until now, it is completely unknown whether moral
   processing of sexual offenses is altered in pedophiles. A total of 31
   pedophilic men and 19 healthy controls were assessed by using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in combination with a moral judgment
   paradigm consisting of 36 scenarios describing different types of
   offenses.
   Scenarios depicting sexual offenses against children compared to those
   depicting adults were associated with higher pattern of activation in
   the left temporo-parietal-junction (TPJ) and left posterior insular
   cortex, the posterior cingulate gyrus as well as the precuneus in
   controls relative to pedophiles, and vice versa. Moreover, brain
   activation in these areas were positively associated with ratings of
   moral reprehensibility and negatively associated with decision
   durations, but only in controls. Brain activation, found in key areas
   related to the broad network of moral judgment, theory of mind and
   (socio-)moral disgust - point to different moral processing of sexual
   offenses in pedophilia in general. The lack of associations between
   brain activation and behavioral responses in pedophiles further suggest
   a biased response pattern or dissected implicit valuation processes.}},

Abstract = {{Negative emotionality (NE) refers to individual differences in the
   propensity to experience and react with negative emotions and is
   associated with increased risk of psychological disorder. However,
   research on the neural bases of NE has focused almost exclusively on
   amygdala activity during emotional face processing. This study broadened
   this framework by examining the relationship between observed NE in
   early childhood and subsequent neural responses to emotional faces in
   both the amygdala and the fusiform face area (FFA) in a late
   childhood/early adolescent sample. Measures of NE were obtained from
   children at age 3 using laboratory observations, and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected when these children were
   between the ages of 9 and 12 while performing a visual stimulus identity
   matching task with houses and emotional faces as stimuli. Multiple
   regression analyses revealed that higher NE at age 3 is associated with
   significantly greater activation in the left amygdala and left FFA but
   lower functional connectivity between these two regions during the face
   conditions. These findings suggest that those with higher early NE have
   subsequent alterations in both activity and connectivity within an
   extended network during face processing.}},

Abstract = {{The lateral habenula plays a central role in reward and punishment
   processing and has been suggested to drive the cardinal symptom of
   anhedonia in depression. This hypothesis is largely based on
   observations of habenula hypermetabolism in animal models of depression,
   but the activity of habenula and its relationship with clinical symptoms
   in patients with depression remains unclear. High-resolution functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and computational modelling were used
   to investigate the activity of the habenula during a probabilistic
   reinforcement learning task with rewarding and punishing outcomes in 21
   unmedicated patients with major depression and 17 healthy participants.
   High-resolution anatomical scans were also acquired to assess group
   differences in habenula volume. Healthy individuals displayed the
   expected activation in the left habenula during receipt of punishment
   and this pattern was confirmed in the computational analysis of
   prediction error processing. In depressed patients, there was a trend
   towards attenuated left habenula activation to punishment, while greater
   left habenula activation was associated with more severe depressive
   symptoms and anhedonia. We also identified greater habenula volume in
   patients with depression, which was associated with anhedonic symptoms.
   Habenula dysfunction may contribute to abnormal response to punishment
   in patients with depression, and symptoms such as anhedonia.}},

   deceitful or ironic. In particular, the novelty of the present study is
   that it explores the existence of a specific cerebral area involved in
   the recognition of irony versus deceit. We presented 23 healthy
   participants with 48 context stories each followed by a target sentence.
   For each story we designed different versions eliciting, respectively,
   different pragmatic interpretations of the same target sentence literal,
   deceitful or ironic. We kept the semantic and syntactic complexity of
   the target sentence constant across the conditions. Our results showed
   that the recognition of ironic communicative intention activated the
   left temporo-parietal junction (ITPJ), the left inferior frontal gyrus
   (IIFG), the left middle frontal gyms (IMFG), the left middle temporal
   gyms (IMTG), and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (IDLPFC).
   Comprehension of deceitful communicative intention activated the IIFG,
   the IMFG, and the IDLPFC. fMRI analysis revealed that a left
   fronto-temporal network including the inferior frontal gyms (IFG), the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the middle frontal gyms (MFG)
   is activated in both irony and deceit recognition. The original result
   of the present investigation is that the IMTG was found to be more
   active in the comprehension of ironic versus deceitful communicative
   intention, thus suggesting its specific role in irony recognition. To
   conclude, our results showed that common cerebral areas are recruited in
   the comprehension of both pragmatic phenomena, while the IMTG has a key
   role in the recognition of ironic versus deceitful communicative
   intention. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Mechanisms of hemispheric lateralization: A replication study}},
Journal = {{CORTEX}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{182-192}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{It has been shown, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
   that hemispheric lateralization of brain activity depends on the
   requirements of the cognitive task performed during the processing of a
   sensory stimulus rather than on the intrinsic characteristics of that
   stimulus {[}Stephan et al., 2003, Science 301 (5631): 384-6].
   Task-dependent increase in the coupling of the anterior cingulate cortex
   (ACC), a region involved in cognitive control, and brain areas in the
   left prefrontal and right parietal cortex, respectively, regions
   involved in task execution, was proposed as the mechanism underlying
   this task-dependency of hemispheric lateralization. The aim of the
   present study was two-fold: First, we aimed for a conceptual replication
   of these findings in an independent sample of subjects. Second, we
   investigated the test retest reliability of the imaging paradigm to
   assess whether the task can be used to capture reliable measures of
   inter-individual differences in hemispheric lateralization. We were able
   to confirm previous findings showing that hemispheric lateralization
   depends on the nature of the cognitive task rather than on the nature of
   the processed stimuli. The task-related brain activation patterns were
   highly reliable across sessions (as indicated by intra-class correlation
   coefficients - ICCs, >=.51). We could, however, not replicate previous
   results proposing task-dependent changes in the coupling between ACC and
   brain regions for task execution as the mechanism underlying hemispheric
   lateralization. This re-opens the question which mechanisms could
   determine the task-dependent functional asymmetries that were observed
   previously and replicated in this study. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Recent evidence suggests that the function of the core system for face
   perception might extend beyond visual face-perception to a broader role
   in person perception. To critically test the broader role of core
   face-system in person perception, we examined the role of the core
   system during the perception of others in 7 congenitally blind
   individuals and 15 sighted subjects by measuring their neural responses
   using fMRI while they listened to voices and performed identity and
   emotion recognition tasks. We hypothesised that in people who have had
   no visual experience of faces, core face-system areas may assume a role
   in the perception of others via voices. Results showed that emotions
   conveyed by voices can be decoded in homologues of the core face system
   only in the blind. Moreover, there was a specific enhancement of
   response to verbal as compared to non-verbal stimuli in bilateral
   fusiform face areas and the right posterior superior temporal sulcus
   showing that the core system also assumes some language-related
   functions in the blind. These results indicate that, in individuals with
   no history of visual experience, areas of the core system for face
   perception may assume a role in aspects of voice perception that are
   relevant to social cognition and perception of others' emotions.}},

Abstract = {{How should neuroscience research about social-psychological phenomena
   identify its objects of inquiry, so as to develop adequate experimental
   paradigms and tasks to elicit them, and then look for their neural
   correlates? How should it go about conceptualizing objects such as
   morality, empathy, art, love, creativity, or religious belief? If a
   neuroscientist is after the neural correlates of X, how can she tell X
   from non-X? This is an important methodological problem, to which
   neuroscience hasn't given enough thought. I argue that it actually
   consists of two distinct questions: first, what counts as object X; and
   second, how to tell what counts as object X. At neither level can
   neuroscientists avoid taking sides in philosophical and social science
   controversies. I further argue that they can therefore benefit from the
   relevant literatures in philosophy, social science, and the humanities.
   These literatures can help neuroscience studies better conceptualize and
   operationalize the social-psychological phenomena they are interested
   in-and thus better get at them, specify how experimental results might
   speak to the real social world, and clarify what exactly neural
   correlates are neural correlates of.}},

Abstract = {{Background: People with anorexia nervosa (AN) have difficulties in a
   wide range of social-emotional processes. Previous work suggests
   atypical involvement of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala, insula,

   Methods: Twenty women with AN and twenty healthy comparison (HC) women
   were presented with happy, fearful, and neutral faces during a
   functional magnetic resonance imaging study. Group differences were
   investigated in the following regions of interest: lateral PFC,
   amygdala, insula, and fusiform gyri.
   Results: The HC participants showed significantly increased recruitment
   of the ventrolateral PFC and amygdala in the fearful > neutral contrast
   relative to the AN participants. The AN participants showed a
   significantly increased recruitment of a small cluster in the right
   posterior insula in the happy > neutral contrast.
   Conclusions: These findings are in line with the hypothesis that people
   with AN have a blunted response to negative and atypical exaggerated
   response to positive emotionally provoking stimuli.}},

   Considerations}},
Journal = {{CURRENT RHEUMATOLOGY REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose of Review Fibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by widespread
   pain and a spectrum of psychological comorbidities, rendering treatment
   difficult and often a financial burden. Fibromyalgia is a complicated
   chronic pain condition that requires a multimodal therapeutic approach
   to optimize treatment efficacy. Thus, it has been postulated that
   mind-body techniques may prove fruitful in treating fibromyalgia.
   Mindfulness meditation, a behavioral technique premised on non-reactive
   sensory awareness, attenuates pain and improves mental health outcomes.
   However, the impact of mindfulness meditation on fibromyalgia-related
   outcomes has not been comprehensively characterized. The present review
   delineates the existing evidence supporting the effectiveness and
   hypothesized mechanisms of mindfulness meditation in treating
   fibromyalgia-related outcomes.
   Recent Findings Mindfulness-based interventions premised on cultivating
   acceptance, non-attachment, and social engagement may be most effective
   in decreasing fibromyalgia-related pain and psychological symptoms.
   Mindfulness-based therapies may alleviate fibromyalgia-related outcomes
   through multiple neural, psychological, and physiological processes.
   Summary Mindfulness meditation may provide an effective complementary
   treatment approach for fibromyalgia patients, especially when combined
   with other reliable techniques (exercise; cognitive behavioral therapy).
   However, characterizing the specific analgesic mechanisms supporting
   mindfulness meditation is a critical step to fostering the clinical
   validity of this technique. Identification of the specific analgesic
   mechanisms supporting mindfulness-based pain relief could be utilized to
   better design behavioral interventions to specifically target
   fibromyalgia-related outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Although borderline personality disorder (BPD)-one of the
   most common, burdensome, and costly psychiatric conditions-is
   characterized by repeated interpersonal conflict and instable
   relationships, the neurobiological mechanism of social interactive
   deficits remains poorly understood.
   OBJECTIVE To apply recent advancements in the investigation of 2-person
   human social interaction to investigate interaction difficulties among
   people with BPD.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-brain information flow in BPD
   was examined from May 25, 2012, to December 4, 2015, in pairs of
   participants studied in 2 linked functional magnetic resonance imaging
   scanners in a university setting. Participants performed a joint
   attention task. Each pair included a healthy control individual (HC) and
   either a patient currently fulfilling DSM-IV criteria for BPD (cBPD) (n
   = 23), a patient in remission for 2 years or more (rBPD) (n = 17), or a
   second HC (n = 20). Groups were matched for age and educational level.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES A measure of cross-brain neural couplingwas
   computed following previously published work to indicate synchronized
   flow between right temporoparietal junction networks (previously shown
   to host neural coupling abilities in health). This measure is derived
   from an independent component analysis contrasting the time courses of
   components between pairs of truly interacting participants compared with
   bootstrapped control pairs.
   RESULTS In the sample including 23 women with cBPD (mean {[}SD] age,
   26.8 {[}5.7] years), 17 women with rBPD (mean {[}SD] age, 28.5 {[}4.3]
   years), and 80 HCs (mean {[}SD] age, 24.0 {[}3.4] years]) investigated
   as dyads, neural coupling was found to be associated with disorder state
   (eta(2) = 0.17; P = .007): while HC-HC pairs showed synchronized neural
   responses, cBPD-HC pairs exhibited significantly lower neural coupling
   just above permutation-based data levels (eta(2) = 0.16; P = .009). No
   difference was found between neural coupling in rBPD-HC and HC-HC pairs.
   The neural coupling in patients was significantly associated with
   childhood adversity (T = 2.3; P = .03).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study provides a neural correlate for a
   core diagnostic and clinical feature of BPD. Results indicate that
   hyperscanningmay deliver state-associated biomarkers for clinical social
   neuroscience. In addition, at least some neural deficits of BPD may be
   more reversible than is currently assumed for personality disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: To advance translational studies of the role of reward prediction
   error (PE) in alcohol use disorder, the present study sought to develop
   and conduct an initial test of an alcohol-specific PE task paradigm
   using functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans.
   Methods: Alcohol dependent or social drinkers received small tastes of
   their preferred alcohol beverage or control beverage, with preceding
   visual cues indicating whether alcohol (or water) would be delivered. To
   assess both positive and negative PE signals, expectancies were
   systematically violated in both positive (i.e. expecting water and
   receiving alcohol) and negative (i.e. expecting alcohol and receiving
   water) directions. Exploratory trial-by-trial analyses were conducted to
   explore temporal fluctuations of activation within a priori-defined
   regions of interest that have been implicated in cue reactivity and PE
   processing.
   Results: Across the entire sample of participants, positive PE-related
   brain activation was found in a large cluster comprised of frontal lobe
   regions, as well as insular cortex, and motor/sensory cortices. Compared
   to social drinking subjects, alcohol dependent subjects had greater
   positive PE-related brain activity in left superior parietal lobule,
   lateral occipital cortex and postcentral gyrus. Exploratory
   trial-by-trial analyses indicated differences in activation specific to
   type of taste, mostly at earlier trials.
   Conclusions: This task-development oriented pilot study found that PE
   signaling may not be detected in expected brain regions when image
   analyses average across all PE trials of the task. Rather, a
   trial-by-trial analysis approach may help detect sparse, temporally
   distinct PE signaling in expected reward processing regions.
   Short Summary: This fMRI study of reward prediction error found greater
   positive prediction error-related activity (i.e. expecting water taste,
   receiving alcohol taste) in alcohol dependent individuals relative to
   social drinkers in parietal and occipital cortices. Trial-by-trial
   analyses may be able to better detect sparse prediction error signaling
   in expected reward processing regions.}},

Abstract = {{The amygdala-medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) circuit plays a key role in
   social behavior. The amygdala and mPFC are bidirectionally connected,
   functionally and anatomically, via the uncinate fasciculus. Recent
   evidence suggests that GABA-ergic neurotransmission within the mPFC
   could be central to the regulation of amygdala activity related to
   emotions and anxiety processing. However, the functional and
   neurochemical interactions within amygdala-mPFC circuits are unclear. In
   the current study, multimodal magnetic resonance imaging techniques were
   combined to investigate effective connectivity within the amygdala-mPFC
   network and its relationship with mPFC neurotransmission in 22 healthy
   subjects aged between 41 and 88 years. Effective connectivity in the
   amygdala-mPFC circuit was assessed on resting-state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging data using spectral dynamic causal modelling. State
   and trait anxiety were also assessed. The mPFC was shown to be the
   target of incoming outputs from the amygdalae and the source of exciting
   inputs to the limbic system. The amygdalae were reciprocally connected
   by excitatory projections. About half of the variance relating to the
   strength of top-down endogenous connection between right amygdala and
   mPFC was explained by mPFC GABA levels. State anxiety was correlated
   with the strength of the endogenous connections between right amygdala
   and mPFC. We suggest that mPFC GABA content predicts variability in the
   effective connectivity within the mPFC-amygdala circuit, providing new
   insights on emotional physiology and the underlying functional and
   neurochemical interactions.}},

Title = {{Defining the Neural Substrate of the Adult Outcome of Childhood ADHD: A
   Multimodal Neuroimaging Study of Response Inhibition}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{174}},
Number = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Understanding the neural processes tied to the adult outcome
   of childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) could guide
   novel interventions to improve its clinical course. It has been argued
   that normalization of prefrontal cortical activity drives remission from
   ADHD, while anomalies in subcortical processes are ``fixed,{''} present
   even in remission. Using multimodal neuroimaging of inhibitory
   processes, the authors tested these hypotheses in adults followed since
   childhood, contrasting remitted against persistent ADHD.
   Method: Adult participants (persistent ADHD, N=35; remitted ADHD, N=47;
   never affected, N=99) were scanned with functional MRI (fMRI) (N=85),
   magnetoencephalography (N=33), or both (N=63) during a response
   inhibition task.
   Results: In fMRI analyses, during inhibition, right caudate anomalies
   reflected a childhood ADHD history and were present even among those who
   remitted. By contrast, differences related to adult outcome emerged in
   cortical (right inferior frontal and inferior parietal/precuneus) and
   cerebellar regions. The persistent ADHD group showed under activation,
   whereas the remitted ADHD group did not differ significantly from the
   never-affected group. Magnetoencephalography showed that the association
   between adult symptom severity and prefrontal neuronal activity was
   confined to the time window covering the act of inhibition (300 ms-350
   ms). Group differences in cerebellar and parietal neuronal activity
   occurred during the time window of performance monitoring processes (500
   ms-600 ms).
   Conclusions: By combining fMRI and magnetoencephalography, the location
   and time window of neuronal activity that underpins the adult outcome of
   ADHD was pinpointed. Thus, the cortico-cerebellar processes tied to the
   clinical course of ADHD are separated from the subcorticat processes
   that are not.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is characterized by a
   clinical triad (gait disturbance, dementia, and urinary incontinence),
   and by radiological findings of enlarged ventricles reflecting
   disturbance of central spinal fluid circulation. A diagnosis of iNPH is
   sometimes challenging, and the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying
   the clinical symptoms of iNPH remain largely unknown. Here, we used an
   emerging MRI technique, resting-state functional connectivity MRI
   (rsfcMRI), to develop a subsidiary diagnostic technique and to explore
   the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of iNPH. rsfcMRI data were
   obtained from 11 patients with iNPH and 11 age-matched healthy
   volunteers, yielding rsfcMRI-derived functional connectivity (FC) from
   both groups. A linear support vector machine classifier was trained to
   distinguish the patterns of FCs of the patients with iNPH from those of
   the healthy volunteers. After dimensional reduction, the support vector
   machine successfully classified the two groups with an accuracy of 80\%.
   Moreover, we found that rsfcMRI-derived FC carried information to
   predict the severity of the triad in iNPH. FCs relevant to the
   classification of severity were mainly based on interhemispheric
   connectivity, suggesting that disruption of the corpus callosum fibers
   due to ventricular enlargement may explain the triad of iNPH. The
   present results support the usefulness of rsfcMRI as a tool to
   understand pathophysiology of iNPH, and also to help with its clinical
   diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{Next to the typical motor signs, Parkinson's disease (PD) goes along
   with neuropsychiatric symptoms, amongst others affecting social
   cognition. Particularly, Theory of Mind (ToM) impairments have mostly
   been associated with right hemispherical brain dysfunction, so that it
   might prevail in patients with left dominant PD. Fourty-four PD
   patients, twenty-four with left and twenty with right dominant motor
   symptoms, engaged in the Reading the Mind in the Eyes (RME) and the Faux
   Pas Detection Test (FPD) to assess affective and cognitive ToM. The
   results were correlated with performance in further cognitive tests, and
   analyzed with respect to associations with the side of motor symptom
   dominance and severity of motor symptoms. No association of ToM
   performance with right hemispheric dysfunction was found. RME results
   were inversely correlated with motor symptom severity, while FPD
   performance was found to correlate with the performance in verbal
   fluency tasks and the overall cognitive evaluation. Affective ToM was
   found associated with motor symptom severity and cognitive ToM
   predominantly with executive function, but no effect of PD
   lateralization on this was identified. The results suggest that deficits
   in social cognition occur as a sequel of the general corticobasal
   pathology in PD, rather than as a result of hemisphere-specific
   dysfunction.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce an approach that predicts neural representations of word
   meanings contained in sentences then superposes these to predict neural
   representations of new sentences. A neurobiological semantic model based
   on sensory, motor, social, emotional, and cognitive attributes was used
   as a foundation to define semantic content. Previous studies have
   predominantly predicted neural patterns for isolated words, using models
   that lack neurobiological interpretation. Fourteen participants read 240
   sentences describing everyday situations while undergoing fMRI. To
   connect sentence-level fMRI activation patterns to the word-level
   semantic model, we devised methods to decompose the fMRI data into
   individual words. Activation patterns associated with each attribute in
   the model were then estimated using multiple-regression. This enabled
   synthesis of activation patterns for trained and new words, which were
   subsequently averaged to predict new sentences. Region-of-interest
   analyses revealed that prediction accuracy was highest using voxels in
   the left temporal and inferior parietal cortex, although a broad range
   of regions returned statistically significant results, showing that
   semantic information is widely distributed across the brain. The results
   show how a neurobiologically motivated semantic model can decompose
   sentence-level fMRI data into activation features for component words,
   which can be recombined to predict activation patterns for new
   sentences.}},

Abstract = {{Acute stress disorder (ASD) is predictive of the development of
   posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In response to symptom
   provocation, the exposure to trauma-related pictures, ASD patients
   showed increased activation of the medial posterior areas of precuneus
   and posterior cingulate cortex as well as of superior prefrontal cortex
   in a previous study. The current study aimed at investigating which
   activated areas are predictive of the development of PTSD. Nineteen ASD
   patients took part in an fMRI study in which they were shown
   personalized trauma-related and neutral pictures within 4 weeks of the
   traumatic event. They were assessed for severity of PTSD 4 weeks later.
   Activation contrasts between trauma-related and neutral pictures were
   correlated with subsequent PTSD symptom severity. Greater activation in,
   among others, right medial precuneus, left retrosplenial cortex,
   precentral and right superior temporal gyrus as well as less activation
   in lateral, superior prefrontal and left fusiform gyrus was related to
   subsequently increased PTSD severity. The results are broadly in line
   with neural areas related to etiological models of PTSD, namely
   multisensory associative learning recruiting posterior regions on the
   one hand and failure to reappraise maladaptive cognitions, thought to
   involve prefrontal areas, on the other.}},

Abstract = {{Emotion instability in borderline personality disorder (BPD) has been
   associated with an impaired fronto-limbic inhibitory network. However,
   functional connectivity (FC) underlying altered emotion regulation in
   BPD has yet to be established. Here, we used resting-state fMRI to
   investigate enduring effects of effortful emotion regulation on the
   amygdala intrinsic FC in BPD. In this multicenter study, resting-state
   fMRI was acquired before and after an emotion regulation task in 48 BPD
   patients and 39 non-patient comparison individuals. The bilateral
   amygdalae were used as a seed in the whole-brain FC analysis and two-way
   mixed ANOVA to test whether BPD patients exhibited weaker post-task
   increase in the amygdala intrinsic FC with the prefrontal cortex (PFC),
   compared to non-patients. Subsequently, we explored whether the results
   are common for personality disorders characterized by emotional
   problems, using additional data of 21 cluster-C personality disorder
   patients. In contrast to non-patients, BPD patients failed to show
   increased post-task amygdala resting-state FC with the medial,
   dorsolateral, ventrolateral PFC, and superior temporal gyrus, but
   surprisingly exhibited decreased FC with the posterior cingulate cortex
   and increased FC with the superior parietal lobule. In BPD patients, the
   emotion regulation task failed to increase resting-state amygdala FC
   with brain regions essential for effortful emotion regulation, which
   suggests: (a) altered cognitive control typically used to indirectly
   alleviate distress by reinterpreting the meaning of emotional stimuli;
   (b) impaired direct regulation of emotional responses, which might be
   common for personality disorders; (c) avoidance of self-related
   appraisals induced by social emotional stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{Humans belong to a minority of mammalian species that exhibit monogamous
   pair-bonds, thereby enabling biparental care of offspring. The high
   reward value of interpersonal closeness and touch in couples is a key
   proximate mechanism facilitating the maintenance of enduring romantic
   bonds. However, surprisingly, the neurobiological underpinnings
   mediating the unique experience of a romantic partner's touch remain
   unknown. In this randomized placebo (PLC)-controlled, between-group,
   pharmacofunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study involving 192
   healthy volunteers (96 heterosexual couples), we intranasally
   administered 24 IU of the hypothalamic peptide oxytocin (OXT) to either
   the man or the woman. Subsequently, we scanned the subjects while they
   assumed that they were being touched by their romantic partners or by an
   unfamiliar person of the opposite sex, although in reality an identical
   pattern of touch was always given by the same experimenter. Our results
   show that intranasal OXT compared to PLC selectively enhanced the
   subjective pleasantness of the partner's touch. Importantly, intranasal
   OXT selectively increased responses to partner touch in the nucleus
   accumbens (NAcc) and anterior cingulate cortex. Under OXT, NAcc
   activations to partner touch positively correlated with the subjects'
   evaluation of their relationship quality. Collectively, our results
   suggest that OXT may contribute to the maintenance of monogamous
   relationships in humans by concomitantly increasing the reward value of
   partner touch and diminishing the hedonic quality of stranger touch. (C)

Abstract = {{Humans rely on their ability to infer another person's mental state to
   understand and predict others' behavior ({''}theory of mind,{''}ToM).
   Multiple lines of research suggest that not only are humans able to
   consciously process another person's belief state, but also are able to
   do so implicitly. Here we explored how general implicit belief states
   are represented in the brain, compared to those substrates involved in
   explicit ToM processes. Previous work on this topic has yielded
   conflicting results, and thus, the extent to which the implicit and
   explicit ToM systems draw on common neural bases is unclear.
   Participants were presented with ``Sally-Anne{''} type movies in which a
   protagonist was falsely led to believe a ball was in one location, only
   for a puppet to later move it to another location in their absence
   (false-belief condition). In other movies, the protagonist had their
   back turned the entire time the puppet moved the ball between the two
   locations, meaning that they had no opportunity to develop any
   pre-existing beliefs about the scenario (no-belief condition). Using a
   group of independently localized explicit ToM brain regions, we found
   greater activity for false-belief trials, relative to no-belief trials,
   in the right temporoparietal junction, right superior temporal sulcus,
   precuneus, and left middle prefrontal gyrus. These findings extend upon
   previous work on the neural bases of implicit ToM by showing substantial
   overlap between this system and the explicit ToM system, suggesting that
   both abilities might recruit a common set of mentalizing
   processes/functional brain regions. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Effective leaders are believed to inspire followers by providing
   inclusive visions of the future that followers can identify with. In the
   present study, we examined the neural mechanisms underlying this
   process, testing key hypotheses derived from transformational and social
   identity approaches to leadership. While undergoing functional MRI,
   supporters from the two major Australian political parties (Liberal vs.
   Labor) were presented with inspirational collectiveoriented and
   noninspirational personal-oriented statements made by in-group and
   out-group leaders. Imaging data revealed that inspirational (rather than
   noninspirational) statements from in-group leaders were associated with
   increased activation in the bilateral rostral inferior parietal lobule,
   pars opercularis, and posterior midcingulate cortex: brain areas that
   are typically implicated in controlling semantic information processing.
   In contrast, for out-group leaders, greater activation in these areas
   was associated with noninspirational statements. In addition,
   noninspirational statements by in-group (but not out-group) leaders
   resulted in increased activation in the medial prefrontal cortex, an
   area typically associated with reasoning about a person's mental state.
   These results show that followers processed identical statements
   qualitatively differently as a function of leaders' group membership,

Abstract = {{How does the brain encode and organize our understanding of the people
   we know? In this study, participants imagined personally familiar others
   in a variety of contexts while undergoing fMRI. Using multivoxel pattern
   analysis, we demonstrated that thinking about familiar others elicits
   consistent fine-grained patterns of neural activity. Person-specific
   patterns were distributed across many regions previously associated with
   social cognition, including medial prefrontal, medial parietal, and
   lateral temporoparietal cortices, as well as other regions including the
   anterior and mid-cingulate, insula, and precentral gyrus. Analogous
   context-specific patterns were observed in medial parietal and superior
   occipital regions. These results suggest that medial parietal cortex may
   play a particularly central role in simulating familiar others, as this
   is the only region to simultaneously represent both person and context
   information. Moreover, within portions of medial parietal cortex, the
   degree to which person-specific patterns were typically instated on a
   given trial predicted subsequent judgments of accuracy and vividness in
   the mental simulation. This suggests that people may access neural
   representations in this region to form metacognitive judgments of
   confidence in their mental simulations. In addition to fine-grained
   patterns within brain regions, we also observed encoding of both
   familiar people and contexts in coarse-grained patterns spread across
   the independently defined social brain network. Finally, we found
   tentative evidence that several established theories of person
   perception might explain the relative similarity between person-specific
   patterns within the social brain network.}},

Journal = {{NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{18-27}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Theoretical models and preceding studies have described age-related
   alterations in neuronal activation of frontoparietal regions in a
   working memory (WM)load-dependent manner. However, to date, underlying
   neuronal mechanisms of these WM load-dependent activation changes in
   aging remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate
   these mechanisms in terms of effective connectivity by application of
   dynamic causal modeling with Bayesian Model Selection. Eighteen healthy
   younger (age: 20-32 years) and 32 older (60-75 years) participants
   performed an n-back task with 3 WM load levels during functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Behavioral and conventional fMRI
   results replicated age group by WM load interactions. Importantly, the
   analysis of effective connectivity derived from dynamic causal modeling,
   indicated an age-and performance-related reduction in WM load-dependent
   modulation of connectivity from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to
   inferior parietal lobule. This finding provides evidence for the
   proposal that age-related WM decline manifests as deficient WM
   load-dependent modulation of neuronal top-down control and can integrate
   implications from theoretical models and previous studies of functional
   changes in the aging brain. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hyperscanning brain paradigm was applied to competitive task for couples
   of subjects. Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) and cognitive
   performance were considered to test inter-brain and cognitive strategy
   similarities between subjects (14 couples) during a joint-action. We
   supposed increased brain-to-brain coupling and improved cognitive
   outcomes due to joint-action and the competition. As supposed, the
   direct interaction between the subjects and the observed external
   feedback of their performance (an experimentally induced fictitious
   feedback) affected the cognitive performance with decreased Error Rates
   (ERs), and Response Times (RTs). In addition, fNIRS measure
   (oxyhemoglobin, O2Hb) revealed an increased brain activity in the
   prefrontal cortex (PFC) in post-feedback more than pre-feedback
   condition. Moreover, a higher inter-brain similarity was found for the
   couples during the task, with higher matched brain response in
   post-feedback condition than pre-feedback. Finally, a significant
   increased prefrontal brain lateralization effect was observed for the
   right hemisphere. Indeed the right PFC was more responsive with similar
   modalities within the couple during the post-feedback condition. The
   joined-task and competitive context was adduced to explain these
   cognitive performance improving, synergic brain responsiveness within
   the couples and lateralization effects (negative emotions).}},

Title = {{Delay discounting is associated with the fractional amplitude of
   low-frequency fluctuations and resting-state functional connectivity in
   late adolescence}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 31}},
Abstract = {{As a component of self-regulation, delay discounting (DD) refers to an
   individual's tendency to prefer smaller-but-sooner rewards over
   larger-but-later rewards and plays an essential role in many aspects of
   human behavior. Although numerous studies have examined the neural
   underpinnings of DD in adults, there are far fewer studies focusing on
   the neurobiological correlates underlying DD in adolescents. Here, we
   investigated the associations between individual differences in DD and
   the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) and
   resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) in 228 high school students
   using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RSfMRI). At
   the regional level, we found an association between higher DD and
   greater fALFF in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), which is
   involved in conflict monitoring and strategy adaptation. At the
   connectivity level, DD was positively correlated with the RSFC between
   the dACC and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a critical
   functional circuit in the cognitive control network. Furthermore, these
   effects persisted even after adjusting for the influences of general
   intelligence and trait impulsivity. Overall, this study reveals the
   fALFF and RSFC as the functional brain basis of DD in late adolescents,
   aiding to strengthen and corroborate our understanding of the neural
   underpinnings of DD.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with `high functioning' schizophrenia (HF-SCZ) may have
   preserved facial affect perception (FAP) compared to individuals with

   supporting preserved FAP in HF-SCZ have yet to be evaluated. This study
   compared brain activation during FAP performance in HF-SCZ, LF-SCZ, and
   controls. Results demonstrated greater activation in the precuneus in
   CON compared to both SCZ groups, while HF-SCZ activated this region
   intermediate to controls and LF-SCZ. These preliminary findings suggest
   greater precuneus activation may be related to preserved FAP in HF-SCZ

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 30}},
Abstract = {{There is an increasing interest in how ongoing spontaneous brain
   activity and personality provide a predisposition for the processing of
   environmental demands. It further has been suggested that the brain has
   an inherent sensitivity to the social environment. Here we tested in
   healthy volunteers if spontaneous brain activity contributes to a
   predisposition for social behavior and how this is modulated by
   narcissistic personality features associated with poor interpersonal
   functioning. Functional magnetic resonance imaging included a resting
   state and an experimental paradigm focusing on the anticipation of
   actively touching an animate (human hand) versus an inanimate target
   (mannequin hand). The experimental task induced a significant modulation
   of neural activity in left postcentral gyrus (PostCG), right culmen and,
   co-varying with narcissistic features, in right anterior insula (AI).
   Neural activity in anticipation of the animate target significantly
   correlated with spontaneous activity during the resting state indexed by
   the Power Law Exponent (PLE) in PostCG and AI. Finally, the correlation
   between spontaneous and task-induced activity in AI was mediated by
   narcissistic features. These findings provide novel evidence for a
   relationship between intrinsic brain activity and social behavior and
   show how personality could contribute to individual differences in our
   predisposition to approach the animate world.}},

Title = {{Hypnotic analgesia reduces brain responses to pain seen in others}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 29}},
Abstract = {{Brain responses to pain experienced by oneself or seen in other people
   show consistent overlap in the pain processing network, particularly
   anterior insula, supporting the view that pain empathy partly relies on
   neural processes engaged by self-nociception. However, it remains
   unresolved whether changes in one's own pain sensation may affect
   empathic responding to others' pain. Here we show that inducing
   analgesia through hypnosis leads to decreased responses to both self and
   vicarious experience of pain. Activations in the right anterior insula
   and amygdala were markedly reduced when participants received painful
   thermal stimuli following hypnotic analgesia on their own hand, but also
   when they viewed pictures of others' hand in pain. Functional
   connectivity analysis indicated that this hypnotic modulation of pain
   responses was associated with differential recruitment of right
   prefrontal regions implicated in selective attention and inhibitory
   control. Our results provide novel support to the view that
   self-nociception is involved during empathy for pain, and demonstrate
   the possibility to use hypnotic procedures to modulate higher-level
   emotional and social processes.}},

Title = {{Decoding social intentions in human prehensile actions: Insights from a
   combined kinematics-fMRI study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{AUG 28}},
Abstract = {{Consistent evidence suggests that the way we reach and grasp an object
   is modulated not only by object properties (e.g., size, shape, texture,
   fragility and weight), but also by the types of intention driving the
   action, among which the intention to interact with another agent (i.e.,
   social intention). Action observation studies ascribe the neural
   substrate of this `intentional' component to the putative mirror neuron
   (pMNS) and the mentalizing (MS) systems. How social intentions are
   translated into executed actions, however, has yet to be addressed. We
   conducted a kinematic and a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
   study considering a reach-to-grasp movement performed towards the same
   object positioned at the same location but with different intentions:
   passing it to another person (social condition) or putting it on a
   concave base (individual condition). Kinematics showed that individual
   and social intentions are characterized by different profiles, with a
   slower movement at the level of both the reaching (i.e., arm movement)
   and the grasping (i.e., hand aperture) components. fMRI results showed
   that: (i)distinct voxel pattern activity for the social and the
   individual condition are present within the pMNS and the MS during
   action execution; (ii) decoding accuracies of regions belonging to the
   pMNS and the MS are correlated, suggesting that these two systems could
   interact for the generation of appropriate motor commands. Results are
   discussed in terms of motor simulation and inferential processes as part
   of a hierarchical generative model for action intention understanding
   and generation of appropriate motor commands.}},

Title = {{Predicting Intentions of a Familiar Significant Other Beyond the Mirror
   Neuron System}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{AUG 25}},
Abstract = {{Inferring intentions of others is one of the most intriguing issues in
   interpersonal interaction. Theories of embodied cognition and simulation
   suggest that this mechanism takes place through a direct and automatic
   matching process that occurs between an observed action and past
   actions. This process occurs via the reactivation of past self-related
   sensorimotor experiences within the inferior frontoparietal network
   (including the mirror neuron system, MNS). The working model is that the
   anticipatory representations of others behaviors require internal
   predictive models of actions formed from pre-established, shared
   representations between the observer and the actor. This model suggests
   that observers should be better at predicting intentions performed by a
   familiar actor, rather than a stranger. However, little is known about
   the modulations of the intention brain network as a function of the
   familiarity between the observer and the actor. Here, we combined
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a behavioral intention
   inference task, in which participants were asked to predict intentions
   from three types of actors: A familiar actor (their significant other),
   themselves (another familiar actor), and a non-familiar actor (a
   stranger). Our results showed that the participants were better at
   inferring intentions performed by familiar actors than non-familiar
   actors and that this better performance was associated with greater
   activation within and beyond the inferior frontoparietal network i.e.,
   in brain areas related to familiarity (e.g., precuneus). In addition,
   and in line with Hebbian principles of neural modulations, the more the
   participants reported being cognitively close to their partner, the less
   the brain areas associated with action self-other comparison (e.g.,
   inferior parietal lobule), attention (e.g., superior parietal lobule),
   recollection (hippocampus), and pair bond (ventral tegmental area. VTA)
   were recruited, suggesting that the more a shared mental representation
   has been pre-established, the more neurons show suppression in their
   response to the presentation of information to which they are sensitive.
   These results suggest that the relation of performance to the extent of
   neural activation during intention understanding may display
   differential relationships based on the cognitive domain, brain region,
   and the cognitive interdependence between the observer and the actor.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{AUG 22}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies have revealed that greater neural pattern similarity
   across repetitions is associated with better subsequent memory. In this
   study, we used an artificial language training paradigm and
   representational similarity analysis to examine whether neural pattern
   similarity across repetitions before training was associated with
   post-training behavioral performance. Twenty-four native Chinese
   speakers were trained to learn a logographic artificial language for 12
   days and behavioral performance was recorded using the word naming and
   picture naming tasks. Participants were scanned while performing a
   passive viewing task before training, after 4-day training and after
   12-day training. Results showed that pattern similarity in the left pars
   opercularis (PO) and fusiform gyrus (FG) before training was negatively
   associated with reaction time (RT) in both word naming and picture
   naming tasks after training. These results suggest that neural pattern
   similarity is an effective neurofunctional predictor of novel word
   learning in addition to word memory.}},

Abstract = {{The NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine elicits a long-lasting
   antidepressant response in patients with treatment-resistant depression.
   Understanding how antagonism of NMDARs alters synapse and circuit
   function is pivotal to developing circuit-based therapies for
   depression. Using virally induced gene deletion, ex vivo
   optogenetic-assisted circuit analysis, and in vivo chemogenetics and
   fMRI, we assessed the role of NMDARs in the medial prefrontal cortex
   (mPFC) in controlling depressionrelated behavior in mice. We demonstrate
   that post-developmental genetic deletion of the NMDAR subunit GluN2B
   from pyramidal neurons in the mPFC enhances connectivity between the
   mPFC and limbic thalamus, but not the ventral hippocampus, and reduces
   depression-like behavior. Using intersectional chemogenetics, we show
   that activation of this thalamocortical circuit is sufficient to elicit
   a decrease in despair-like behavior. Our findings reveal that GluN2B
   exerts input-specific control of pyramidal neuron innervation and
   identify a medial dorsal thalamus (MDT)/mPFCcircuit that controls
   depression-like behavior.}},

Title = {{Arginine Vasopressin Effects on Subjective Judgments and Neural
   Responses to Same and Other-Sex Faces in Men and Women}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 21}},
Abstract = {{Arginine vasopressin (AVP) influences social and emotional behaviors
   across a wide range of species. In humans, intranasal AVP has been
   previously shown to alter physiological responses to and subjective
   judgments of same-sex faces in both men and women. The present study
   attempted to elucidate the neural mechanism for these effects by
   randomizing 40 healthy men and 40 healthy women to treatment with either
   40 IU intranasal AVP or a saline placebo approximately 30 min before
   imaging their brain function with fMRI as they viewed same and other-sex
   faces. All subjects were also scanned a second time several days later
   with no treatment to evaluate the persistence of AVP effects over time.
   AVP acutely increased positive ratings of same-sex faces in women, with
   some evidence that these effects persisted until the second scan. While
   AVP had no acute effects on same-sex ratings in men, AVP increased
   positive ratings of same-sex faces several days later. On the other
   hand, AVP had no effect on other-sex face judgments in either sex. AVP
   modulation of brain function was focused on the nucleus accumbens (NAc)
   and the lateral septum, two reward processing areas involved in the
   formation of social bonds. AVP provoked acute increases in right NAc and
   bilateral lateral septum responses to female faces among men, with left
   lateral septum responses persisting over time while right NAc responses
   reversed over time. Finally, AVP modulated hypothalamic activation to
   faces in both men and women. The present study therefore indicates that
   intranasal AVP affects subjective ratings and neural responses to same
   and other-sex faces in men and women, with some effects persisting and
   others emerging over time. Future studies should investigate whether AVP
   effects are modulated by individual variables such as genotype,
   personality, or attachment style as previously reported for other
   nonapeptides.}},

Abstract = {{Learning of prediction error (PE), including reward PE and risk PE, is
   crucial for updating the prediction in reinforcement learning (RL).
   Neurobiological and computational models of RL have reported extensive
   brain activations related to PE. However, the occurrence of PE does not
   necessarily predict updating the prediction, e.g., in a
   probability-known event. Therefore, the brain regions specifically
   engaged in updating the prediction remain unknown. Here, we conducted
   two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments, the
   probability-unknown Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and the probability-known
   risk decision task (RDT). Behavioral analyses confirmed that PEs
   occurred in both tasks but were only used for updating the prediction in
   the IGT. By comparing PE-related brain activations between the two
   tasks, we found that the rostral anterior cingulate cortex/ventral
   medial prefrontal cortex (rACC/vmPFC) and the posterior cingulate cortex
   (PCC) activated only during the IGT and were related to both reward and
   risk PE. Moreover, the responses in the rACC/vmPFC and the PCC were
   modulated by uncertainty and were associated with reward
   prediction-related brain regions. Electric brain stimulation over these
   regions lowered the performance in the IGT but not in the RDT. Our
   findings of a distributed neural circuit of PE processing suggest that
   the rACC/vmPFC and the PCC play a key role in updating the prediction
   through PE processing during decision making.}},

Title = {{Predicting behavior change from persuasive messages using neural
   representational similarity and social network analyses}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{157}},
Pages = {{118-128}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Neural activity in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), identified as
   engaging in self-related processing, predicts later health behavior
   change. However, it is unknown to what extent individual differences in
   neural representation of content and lived experience influence this
   brain-behavior relationship. We examined whether the strength of
   content-specific representations during persuasive messaging relates to
   later behavior change, and whether these relationships change as a
   function of individuals' social network composition. In our study,
   smokers viewed anti-smoking messages while undergoing fMRI and we
   measured changes in their smoking behavior one month later. Using
   representational similarity analyses, we found that the degree to which
   message content (i.e. health, social, or valence information) was
   represented in a self-related processing MPFC region was associated with
   later smoking behavior, with increased representations of negatively
   valenced (risk) information corresponding to greater message-consistent
   behavior change. Furthermore, the relationship between representations
   and behavior change depended on social network composition: smokers who
   had proportionally fewer smokers in their network showed increases in
   smoking behavior when social or health content was strongly represented
   in MPFC, whereas message-consistent behavior (i.e., less smoking) was
   more likely for those with proportionally more smokers in their social
   network who represented social or health consequences more strongly.
   These results highlight the dynamic relationship between representations
   in MPFC and key outcomes such as health behavior change; a complete
   understanding of the role of MPFC in motivation and action should take
   into account individual differences in neural representation of stimulus
   attributes and social context variables such as social network
   composition.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},

Abstract = {{Social interaction is a fundamental part of our daily lives; however,
   exactly how our brains use social cues to determine whether to cooperate
   without being exploited remains unclear. In this study, we used an
   electroencephalography (EEG) hyperscanning approach to investigate the
   effect of face-to-face contact on the brain mechanisms underlying the
   decision to cooperate or defect in an iterated version of the Prisoner's
   Dilemma Game. Participants played the game either in face-to-face or
   face-blocked conditions. The face-to-face interaction led players to
   cooperate more often, providing behavioral evidence for the use of these
   nonverbal cues in their social decision-making. In addition, the EEG
   hyperscanning identified temporal dynamics and inter-brain
   synchronization across the cortex, providing evidence for involvement of
   these regions in the processing of face-to-face cues to read each
   other's intent to cooperate. Most notably, the power of the alpha
   frequency band (8-13 Hz) in the right temporoparietal region immediately
   after seeing a round outcome significantly differed between face-to-face
   and face-blocked conditions and predicted whether an individual would
   adopt a `cooperation' or `defection' strategy. Moreover, inter-brain
   synchronies within this time and frequency range reflected the use of
   these strategies. This study provides evidence for how the cortex uses
   nonverbal social cues to determine other's intentions, and highlights
   the significance of power in the alpha band and inter-brain phase
   synchronizations in high-level socio-cognitive processing.}},

Title = {{Frontal temporal and parietal systems synchronize within and across
   brains during live eye-to-eye contact}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{157}},
Pages = {{314-330}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Human eye-to-eye contact is a primary source of social cues and
   communication. In spite of the biological significance of this
   interpersonal interaction, the underlying neural processes are not
   well-understood. This knowledge gap, in part, reflects limitations of
   conventional neuroimaging methods, including solitary confinement in the
   bore of a scanner and minimal tolerance of head movement that constrain
   investigations of natural, two-person interactions. However, these
   limitations are substantially resolved by recent technical developments
   in functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a non-invasive
   spectral absorbance technique that detects changes in blood oxygen
   levels in the brain by using surface-mounted optical sensors. Functional
   NIRS is tolerant of limited head motion and enables simultaneous
   acquisitions of neural signals from two interacting partners in natural
   conditions. We employ fNIRS to advance a data-driven theoretical
   framework for two-person neuroscience motivated by the Interactive Brain
   Hypothesis which proposes that interpersonal interaction between
   individuals evokes neural mechanisms not engaged during solo,
   non-interactive, behaviors. Within this context, two specific hypotheses
   related to eye-to-eye contact, functional specificity and functional
   synchrony, were tested. The functional specificity hypothesis proposes
   that eye-to-eye contact engages specialized, within-brain, neural
   systems; and the functional synchrony hypothesis proposes that
   eye-to-eye contact engages specialized, across-brain, neural processors
   that are synchronized between dyads. Signals acquired during eye-to-eye
   contact between partners (interactive condition) were compared to
   signals acquired during mutual gaze at the eyes of a picture-face
   (non-interactive condition). In accordance with the specificity
   hypothesis, responses during eye-to-eye contact were greater than
   eye-to-picture gaze for a left frontal cluster that included pars
   opercularis (associated with canonical language production functions
   known as Broca's region), pre- and supplementary motor cortices
   (associated with articulatory systems), as well as the subcentral area.
   This frontal cluster was also functionally connected to a cluster
   located in the left superior temporal gyrus (associated with canonical
   language receptive functions known as Wernicke's region), primary
   somatosensory cortex, and the subcentral area. In accordance with the
   functional synchrony hypothesis, cross-brain coherence during eye-to-eye
   contact relative to eye-to-picture gaze increased for signals
   originating within left superior temporal, middle temporal, and
   supramarginal gyri as well as the pre-and supplementary motor cortices
   of both interacting brains. These synchronous cross-brain regions are
   also associated with known language functions, and were partner-specific
   (i.e., disappeared with randomly assigned partners). Together, both
   within and across-brain neural correlates of eye-to-eye contact included
   components of previously established productive and receptive language
   systems. These findings reveal a left frontal, temporal, and parietal
   long-range network that mediates neural responses during eye-to-eye
   contact between dyads, and advance insight into elemental mechanisms of
   social and interpersonal interactions.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{157}},
Pages = {{400-414}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{People often make decisions in the face of ambiguous information, but it
   remains unclear how ambiguity is represented in the brain. We used three
   types of ambiguous stimuli and combined EEG and fMRI to examine the
   neural representation of perceptual decisions under ambiguity. We
   identified a late positive potential, the LPP, which differentiated
   levels of ambiguity, and which was specifically associated with
   behavioral judgments about choices that were ambiguous, rather than
   passive perception of ambiguous stimuli. Mediation analyses together
   with two further control experiments confirmed that the LPP was
   generated only when decisions are made (not during mere perception of
   ambiguous stimuli), and only when those decisions involved choices on a
   dimension that is ambiguous. A further control experiment showed that a
   stronger LPP arose in the presence of ambiguous stimuli compared to when
   only unambiguous stimuli were present. Source modeling suggested that
   the LPP originated from multiple loci in cingulate cortex, a finding we
   further confirmed using fMRI and fMRI-guided ERP source prediction.
   Taken together, our findings argue for a role of an LPP originating from
   cingulate cortex in encoding decisions based on task-relevant perceptual
   ambiguity, a process that may in turn influence confidence judgment,
   response conflict, and error correction.}},

Title = {{Hope and the brain: Trait hope mediates the protective role of medial

Abstract = {{As a central research topic in the field of positive psychology, hope
   refers to an individual's goal-oriented expectations that include both
   agency thinking (i.e., the motivation to initiate and sustain actions to
   achieve goals) and pathway thinking (i.e., the capacity to find ways
   toward goals). Evidence from many previous studies has shown the role of
   hope in protecting against anxiety. However, little is known about the
   neurobiological basis of hope and the underlying mechanism that how hope
   reduces anxiety in the brain. Here, we employed fractional amplitude of
   low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) to investigate these issues in 231
   high school students using resting-state functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (RS-fMRI). The whole-brain correlation analyses revealed that
   higher trait hope was related to lower fALFF in the bilateral medial
   orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC), which is involved in reward-related
   processing, motivation production, problem solving and goal-directed
   behaviors. Furthermore, mediation analyses suggested that trait hope
   acted as a mediator in the association between mOFC spontaneous activity
   and anxiety. These results persisted even after adjusting for the
   effects of positive and negative affect. Overall, this study provides
   the first evidence for functional brain substrates underlying trait hope
   and reveals a potential mechanism that trait hope mediates the
   protective role of spontaneous brain activity against anxiety.}},

Title = {{Individual differences in functional connectivity during naturalistic
   viewing conditions}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{157}},
Pages = {{521-530}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Naturalistic viewing paradigms such as movies have been shown to reduce
   participant head motion and improve arousal during fMRI scanning
   relative to task-free rest, and have been used to study both functional
   connectivity and stimulus-evoked BOLD-signal changes. These task-based
   hemodynamic changes are synchronized across subjects and involve large
   areas of the cortex, and it is unclear whether individual differences in
   functional connectivity are enhanced or diminished under such
   naturalistic conditions. This work first aims to characterize
   variability in BOLD-signal based functional connectivity (FC) across 2
   distinct movie conditions and eyes-open rest (n=31 healthy adults, 2
   scan sessions each). We found that movies have higher within- and
   between-subject correlations in cluster-wise FC relative to rest. The
   anatomical distribution of inter-individual variability was similar
   across conditions, with higher variability occurring at the lateral
   prefrontal lobes and temporoparietal junctions. Second, we used an
   unsupervised test-retest matching algorithm that identifies individual
   subjects from within a group based on FC patterns, quantifying the
   accuracy of the algorithm across the three conditions. The movies and
   resting state all enabled identification of individual subjects based on
   FC matrices, with accuracies between 61\% and 100\%. Overall, pairings
   involving movies outperformed rest, and the social, fasterpaced movie
   attained 100\% accuracy. When the parcellation resolution, scan
   duration, and number of edges used were increased, accuracies improved
   across conditions, and the pattern of movies > rest was preserved. These
   results suggest that using dynamic stimuli such as movies enhances the
   detection of FC patterns that are unique at the individual level.}},

   altruistic behavior?}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{157}},
Pages = {{598-611}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Altruistic behavior, i.e., promoting the welfare of others at a cost to
   oneself, is subserved by the integration of various social, affective,
   and economic factors represented in extensive brain regions. However, it
   is unclear how different regions interact to process/integrate
   information regarding the helper's interest and recipient's need when
   deciding whether to behave altruistically. Here we combined an
   interactive game with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and
   transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to characterize the
   neural network underlying the processing/integration of self-interest
   and other-need. At the behavioral level, high self-risk decreased
   helping behavior and high other-need increased helping behavior. At the
   neural level, activity in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and right
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC) were positively associated with
   self-risk levels, and activity in right inferior parietal lobe (rIPL)
   and rDLPFC were negatively associated with other-need levels. Dynamic
   causal modeling further suggested that both MPFC and rIPL were
   extrinsically connected to rDLPFC; high self-risk enhanced the effective
   connectivity from MPFC to rDLPFC, and the modulatory effect of
   other-need on the connectivity from rIPL to rDLPFC positively correlated
   with the modulatory effect of other-need on individuals' helping rate.
   Two tDCS experiments provided causal evidence that rDLPFC affects both
   self-interest and other-need concerns, and rIPL selectively affects the
   other-need concerns. These findings suggest a crucial role of the
   MPFC-IPL-DLPFC network during altruistic decision-making, with rDLPFC as
   a central node for integrating and modulating motives regarding
   self-interest and other-need.}},

Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{357}},
Pages = {{208-219}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Human musical ability is proposed to play a key phylogenetical role in
   the evolution of language, and the similarity of hierarchical structure
   in music and language has led to considerable speculation about their
   shared mechanisms. While behavioral and electrophysioglocial studies
   have revealed associations between music and linguistic abilities,
   results from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies on
   their relations are contradictory, possibly because these studies
   usually treat music or language as single entities without breaking down
   to their components. Here, we examined the relations between different
   components of music (i.e., melodic and rhythmic analysis) and language
   (i.e., semantic and phonological processing) using both behavioral tests
   and resting-state fMRI. Behaviorally, we found that individuals with
   music training experiences were better at semantic processing, but not
   at phonological processing, than those without training. Further
   correlation analyses showed that semantic processing of language was
   related to melodic, but not rhythmic, analysis of music. Neurally, we
   found that performances in both semantic processing and melodic analysis
   were correlated with spontaneous brain activities in the bilateral
   precentral gyrus (PCG) and superior temporal plane at the regional
   level, and with the resting-state functional connectivity of the left
   PCG with the left supramarginal gyrus and left superior temporal gyrus
   at the network level. Together, our study revealed the shared
   spontaneous neural basis of music and language based on the behavioral
   link between melodic analysis and semantic processing, which possibly
   relied on a common mechanism of automatic auditory-motor integration.

Title = {{Prefrontal and amygdala engagement during emotional reactivity and
   regulation in generalized anxiety disorder}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{218}},
Pages = {{398-406}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Emotion dysregulation is prominent in generalized anxiety
   disorder (GAD), characterized clinically by exaggerated reactivity to
   negative stimuli and difficulty in down-regulating this response.
   Although limited research implicates frontolimbic disturbances in GAD,
   whether ``neural aberrations occur during emotional reactivity,
   regulation, or both is not well understood.
   Methods: During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 30
   individuals with GAD and 30 healthy controls (HC) completed a well
   -validated explicit emotion regulation task designed to measure
   emotional reactivity and regulation of reactivity. During the task,
   participants viewed negative images (look-Negative' condition) and, on
   some trials, used a cognitive strategy to reduce negative affective
   response (`Reappraise' condition).
   Results: Results from an Analysis of Variance corrected for whole brain
   multiple comparisons showed a significant group x condition interaction
   in the left amygdala and left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Results from
   post-hoc analyses showed that the GAD group engaged these regions to a
   greater extent than HCs during Look Negative but not Reappraise.
   Behaviorally, the GAD group reported feeling more negative than the HC
   group in each condition, although both groups reported reduced negative
   affect following regulation.
   Limitations: As comorbidity was permitted, the presence of concurrent
   disorders, like other anxiety disorders and depression, detracts our
   ability to classify neural engagement particular to GAD alone.
   Conclusions: Individuals with GAD exhibited over-engagement of amygdala
   and frontal regions during the viewing of negative images, compared to
   HCs. Together, these aberrations may indicate that deficits in emotional
   reactivity rather than regulation contribute to emotion dysregulation in
   those with GAD.}},

Abstract = {{Studies have shown that attending to salient group relevant information
   could increase the BOLD activity across distributed neural networks.
   However, it is unclear how attending to group relevant information
   changes the functional connectivity across these networks. We
   investigated this issue combining resting states and task-based fMRI
   experiment. The task involved football fans learning associations
   between arbitrary geometric shapes and the badges of in-group, the rival
   and the neutral football teams. Upon learning, participants viewed
   different badge/shape pairs and their task was to judge whether the
   viewed pair was a match or a mismatch. For whole brain analyses
   increased activity was found in the IFG, DLPFC, AI, fusiform gyrus,
   precuneus and pSTS (all in the left hemisphere) for the rival over the
   in-group mismatch. Further, the ROI analyses revealed larger beta-values
   for the rival badge in the left pSTS, left AI and the left IFG. However,
   larger beta-values were found in the left pSTS and the left IFG (but not
   AI) for the in-group shape. The intrinsic functional connectivity
   analyses revealed that compare to the pre-task, post task functional
   connectivity was decreased between the left DLPFC and the left AI. In
   contrast, it was increased between the left IFG and the left AI and this
   was correlated with the difference in RT for the rival vs. in-group
   team. Our findings suggest that attending to group relevant information
   differentially affects the strength of functional coupling in attention
   networks and this can be explained by the saliency of the group relevant
   information.}},

Title = {{Occipitotemporal Category Representations Are Sensitive to Abstract
   Category Boundaries Defined by Generalization Demands}},

Abstract = {{Categorization involves organizing perceptual information so as to
   maximize differences along dimensions that predict class membership
   while minimizing differences along dimensions that do not. In the
   current experiment, we investigated how neural representations
   reflecting learned category structure vary according to generalization
   demands. We asked male and female human participants to switch between
   two rules when determining whether stimuli should be considered members
   of a single known category. When categorizing according to the
   ``strict{''} rule, participants were required to limit generalization to
   make fine-grained distinctions between stimuli and the category
   prototype. When categorizing according to the ``lax{''} rule,
   participants were required to generalize category knowledge to highly
   atypical category members. As expected, frontoparietal regions were
   primarily sensitive to decisional demands (i.e., the distance of each
   stimulus from the active category boundary), whereas occipitotemporal
   representations were primarily sensitive to stimulus typicality (i.e.,
   the similarity between each exemplar and the category prototype).
   Interestingly, occipitotemporal representations of stimulus typicality
   differed between rules. While decoding models were able to predict
   unseen data when trained and tested on the same rule, they were unable
   to do so when trained and tested on different rules. We additionally
   found that the discriminability of the multivariate signal negatively
   covaried with distance from the active category boundary. Thus, whereas
   many accounts of occipitotemporal cortex emphasize its important role in
   transforming visual information to accentuate learned category
   structure, our results highlight the flexible nature of these
   representations with regards to transient decisional demands.}},

Title = {{Conditional Reasoning in Schizophrenic Patients}},
Journal = {{EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{AUG 8}},
Abstract = {{Conditional reasoning (if p then q) is used very frequently in everyday
   situations. Conditional reasoning is impaired in brain-lesion patients,
   psychopathy, alcoholism, and polydrug dependence. Many neurocognitive
   deficits have also been described in schizophrenia. We assessed
   conditional reasoning in 25 patients with schizophrenia, 25 depressive
   patients, and 25 controls, using the Wason selection task in three
   different domains: social contracts, precautionary rules, and
   descriptive rules. Control measures included depression, anxiety, and
   severity of schizophrenia measures as a Verbal Intelligence Scale.
   Patients with schizophrenia were significantly impaired on all
   conditional reasoning tasks compared to depressives and controls.
   However, the social contract and precautions tasks yielded better
   results than the descriptive tasks. Differences between groups
   disappeared for social contract but remained for precautions and
   descriptive tasks when verbal intelligence was used as a covariate.
   These results suggest that domain-specific reasoning mechanisms,
   proposed by evolutionary psychologists, are relatively resilient in the
   face of brain network disruptions that impair more general reasoning
   abilities. Nevertheless, patients with schizophrenia could encounter
   difficulties understanding precaution rules and social contracts in
   real-life situations resulting in unwise risk-taking and
   misunderstandings in the social world.}},

Abstract = {{What are the neural mechanisms underlying beauty based on objective
   parameters and beauty based on subjective social construction? This
   study scanned participants with fMRI while they performed aesthetic
   judgments on concrete pictographs and abstract oracle bone scripts.
   Behavioral results showed both pictographs and oracle bone scripts were
   judged to be more beautiful when they referred to beautiful objects and
   positive social meanings, respectively. Imaging results revealed regions
   associated with perceptual, cognitive, emotional and reward processing
   were commonly activated both in beautiful judgments of pictographs and
   oracle bone scripts. Moreover, stronger activations of orbitofrontal
   cortex (OFC) and motor-related areas were found in beautiful judgments
   of pictographs, whereas beautiful judgments of oracle bone scripts were
   associated with putamen activity, implying stronger aesthetic experience
   and embodied approaching for beauty were elicited by the pictographs. In
   contrast, only visual processing areas were activated in the judgments
   of ugly pictographs and negative oracle bone scripts. Results provide
   evidence that the sense of beauty is triggered by two processes: one
   based on the objective parameters of stimuli (embodied natural beauty)
   and the other based on the subjective social construction (social
   endowed beauty).}},

Abstract = {{With the advancement in MRI, functional parcellation (FP) of brain
   structure(s) has become an important topic. However, the large number of
   voxels is a major obstacle. A-priori partitioning of the brain into
   several regions of interest (ROIs) is the main data-reduction strategy
   to simplify brain informatics. This study aims to examine the validity
   of ROI-based approach to FP by exploring the concordance of the relative
   distance structures between voxel-wise (raw data) and atlas-informed
   analyses. Structural and resting state functional MRI (rfMRI) scans of
   26 right-handed healthy individuals were selected from the Rockland
   dataset. Four target regions were included in the analyses, that is,
   left and right thalamus and amygdala. For each voxel in the target
   region, four classes of correlation maps (sampling strategies) were
   constructed from the rfMRI: whole brain, cortex, 150 ROIs, and 70 ROIs
   (ROIs are informed by anatomical atlases). The relative distance metric
   between two different voxels was defined as the mean absolute difference
   of their associated correlation maps. Considering all the possible pairs
   of voxels in a target region, the relative distance structure was
   derived and stored in a matrix distance map). For every target region,
   the distance maps were very similar across the four classes of sampling
   strategies, with the grand mean correlation coefficient reaching 0.95.
   The results confirm the validity of previous ROI-based analyses of rfMRI
   data in FP. The rationale and limitation are discussed and an analytic
   strategy of whole-brain FP is proposed. Copyright (C) 2017 Wolters

Abstract = {{During adolescence, prefrontal cortex regions, important in cognitive
   control, undergo maturation to adapt to changing environmental demands.
   Ways through which social-ecological factors contribute to adolescent
   neural cognitive control have not been thoroughly examined. We
   hypothesize that household chaos is a context that may modulate the
   associations among parental control, adolescent neural cognitive
   control, and developmental changes in social competence. The sample
   involved 167 adolescents (ages 13-14 at Time 1, 53\% male). Parental
   control and household chaos were measured using adolescents'
   questionnaire data, and cognitive control was assessed via behavioral
   performance and brain imaging at Time 1. Adolescent social competence
   was reported by adolescents at Time 1 and at Time 2 (one year later).
   Structural equation modeling analyses indicated that higher parental
   control predicted better neural cognitive control only among adolescents
   living in low-chaos households. The association between poor neural
   cognitive control at Time 1 and social competence at Time 2 (after
   controlling for social competence at Time 1) was significant only among
   adolescents living in high-chaos households. Household chaos may
   undermine the positive association of parental control with adolescent
   neural cognitive control and exacerbate the detrimental association of
   poor neural cognitive control with disrupted social competence

   THE EXAMPLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL TOMOGRAPHY CENTER OF SB RAS}},
Journal = {{TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Number = {{421}},
Pages = {{156-162}},

Abstract = {{The article deals with some areas of application of functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) in the International Tomography Center (ITC) of
   the SB RAS. The author offers a brief excursion into the history of the
   development of the method and its institutionalization. From the point
   of view of social significance, she characterizes ITC projects which
   include various aspects of the application of this neuroimaging
   technology used in the study of brain activity in norm and pathology.
   She shows the possibilities of fMRT in biocontrol, the process of
   development of self-regulation skills of the individual and in treatment
   with the technology of interactive neurotics developed in ITC.
   Functional magnetic resonance imaging is an in-vivo noninvasive dynamic
   study of active brain structures at the time of their activity, based on
   the difference in the magnetic properties of the oxyhemoglobin, the O2
   carrier, and deoxy-hemoglobin, a product formed in the parenchyma of the
   brain. These ratios reflect the BOLD-phenomenon (blood oxygenation level
   dependent), a marker of neural activity. The main experimental models in
   fMRI determine the themes of research projects of the ITC SB RAS and
   concern three directions: biophysical modeling using sensorimotor
   paradigms; modeling and analysis of BOLD-effect in conditions of
   permanent and/or temporary disturbance of blood circulation of the brain
   associated with neurological diseases (strokes, convulsions, Parkinson's
   disease, Alzheimer's, etc.); complex forms of behavior and analysis of
   their cognitive mechanisms. Studies using modern technologies of
   magnetic resonance imaging, including functional MRI, convincingly
   attest the priority position of the Center in the institutionalization
   of the fMRI method for Russian science in general and the regional
   Siberian aspect in particular. The main results obtained at the ITC SB
   RAS demonstrate the correspondence between the psychological,
   psychophysiological functions and the localization of the brain
   structures involved in the formation of various skills, expand and
   revise the fundamental concepts of the relationship between mental and
   physiological functions, allowing to dynamically `` brain map{''} exact
   information about their localization. During the research, a significant
   step was taken in the development and implementation of the modern
   method of neuroimaging-fMRI in the fundamental science in the region, as
   well as in medical diagnostic practice. A software and hardware complex
   was developed for recording the activation of the central nervous system
   using the method of functional MRI based on the BOLD effect, which
   includes an MR tomograph, an installation for software generation of
   stimuli of own design and a software package for processing the results
   based on MATLAB. In the course of the work, all the variants of
   functional magnetic resonance imaging for the design of the experiments
   were optimized.}},

Abstract = {{We examine recent work in cognitive neuroscience that investigates brain
   networks. Brain networks are characterized by the ways in which brain
   regions are functionally and anatomically connected to one another.
   Cognitive neuroscientists use various noninvasive techniques (e. g.,
   fMRI) to investigate these networks. They represent them formally as
   graphs. And they use various graph theoretic techniques to analyze them
   further. We distinguish between knowledge of the graph theoretic
   structure of such networks (structural knowledge) and knowledge of what
   instantiates that structure (nonstructural knowledge). And we argue that
   this work provides structural knowledge of brain networks. We explore
   the significance of this conclusion for the scientific realism debate.
   We argue that our conclusion should not be understood as an instance of
   a global structural realist claim regarding the structure of the
   unobservable part of the world, but instead, as a local structural
   realist attitude towards brain networks in particular. And we argue that
   various local approaches to the realism debate, i.e., approaches that
   restrict realist commitments to particular theories and/or entities, are
   problematic insofar as they don't allow for the possibility of such a
   local structural realist attitude. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{People frequently engage in more prosocial behavior toward members of
   their own groups, as compared to other groups. Such group-based
   prosociality may reflect either strategic considerations concerning
   one's own future outcomes or intrinsic value placed on the outcomes of
   in-group members. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment,
   we examined vicarious reward responses to witnessing the monetary gains
   of in-group and out-group members, as well as prosocial behavior towards
   both types of individuals. We found that individuals' investment in
   their group-a motivational component of social identification-tracked
   the intensity of their responses in ventral striatum to in-group (vs
   out-group) members' rewards, as well as their tendency towards
   group-based prosociality. Individuals with strong motivational
   investment in their group preferred rewards for an in-group member,
   whereas individuals with low investment preferred rewards for an
   out-group member. These findings suggest that the motivational
   importance of social identity-beyond mere similarity to group
   members-influences vicarious reward and prosocial behavior. More
   broadly, these findings support a theoretical framework in which salient
   social identities can influence neural representations of subjective
   value, and suggest that social preferences can best be understood by
   examining the identity contexts in which they unfold.}},

Abstract = {{Emotional experiences are frequently shaped by the emotional responses
   of co-present others. Research has shown that people constantly monitor
   and adapt to the incoming social-emotional signals, even without
   face-to-face interaction. And yet, the neural processes underlying such
   emotional transmissions have not been directly studied. Here, we
   investigated how the human brain processes emotional cues which arrive
   from another, co-attending individual. We presented continuous emotional
   feedback to participants who viewed a movie in the scanner. Participants
   in the social group (but not in the control group) believed that the
   feedback was coming from another person who was co-viewing the same
   movie. We found that social-emotional feedback significantly affected
   the neural dynamics both in the core affect and in the medial prefrontal
   regions. Specifically, the response time-courses in those regions
   exhibited increased similarity across recipients and increased neural
   alignment with the timeline of the feedback in the social compared with
   control group. Taken in conjunction with previous research, this study
   suggests that emotional cues from others shape the neural dynamics
   across the whole neural continuum of emotional processing in the brain.
   Moreover, it demonstrates that interpersonal neural alignment can serve
   as a neural mechanism through which affective information is conveyed
   between individuals.}},

Title = {{The neural basis of emotions varies over time: different regions go with

Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{According to theories of emotion dynamics, emotions unfold across two
   phases in which different types of processes come to the fore: emotion
   onset and emotion offset. Differences in onset-bound processes are
   reflected by the degree of explosiveness or steepness of the response at
   onset, and differences in offset-bound processes by the degree of
   accumulation or intensification of the subsequent response. Whether
   onset-and offset-bound processes have distinctive neural correlates and,
   hence, whether the neural basis of emotions varies over time, still
   remains unknown. In the present fMRI study, we address this question
   using a recently developed paradigm that allows to disentangle
   explosiveness and accumulation. Thirty-one participants were exposed to
   neutral and negative social feedback, and asked to reflect on its
   contents. Emotional intensity while reading and thinking about the
   feedback was measured with an intensity profile tracking approach. Using
   non-negative matrix factorization, the resulting profile data were
   decomposed in explosiveness and accumulation components, which were
   subsequently entered as continuous regressors of the BOLD response. It
   was found that the neural basis of emotion intensity shifts as emotions
   unfold over time with emotion explosiveness and accumulation having
   distinctive neural correlates.}},

Abstract = {{Applying electrical stimulation over the prefrontal cortex can help
   nicotine dependents reduce cigarette craving. However, the underlying
   mechanism remains ambiguous. This study investigates this issue with
   functional magnetic resonance imaging. Thirty-twomale chronic smokers
   received real and sham stimulation over dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex
   (DLPFC) separated by 1week. The neuroimaging data of the resting state,
   the smoking cue-reactivity task and the emotion task after stimulation
   were collected. The craving across the cue-reactivity task was
   diminished during real stimulation as compared with sham stimulation.
   The whole-brain analysis on the cue-reactivity task revealed a
   significant interaction between the stimulation condition (real vs sham)
   and the cue type (smoking vs neutral) in the left superior frontal gyrus
   and the leftmiddle frontal gyrus. The functional connectivity between
   the left DLPFC and the right parahippocampal gyrus, as revealed by both
   psychophysical interaction analysis and the resting state functional
   connectivity, is altered by electrical stimulation. Moreover, the
   craving change across the real and sham condition is predicted by
   alteration of functional connectivity revealed by psychophysical
   interaction analysis. The local and long-distance coupling, altered by
   the electrical stimulation, might be the underlying neural mechanism of
   craving regulation.}},

Abstract = {{The present functional neuroimaging study focuses on the iconography of
   mourning. A culture-specific pattern of body postures of mourning
   individuals, mostly suggesting withdrawal, emerged from a survey of
   visual material. When used in different combinations in stylized
   drawings in our neuroimaging study, this material activated cortical
   areas commonly seen in studies of social cognition (temporo-parietal
   junction, superior temporal gyrus, and inferior temporal lobe), empathy
   for pain (somatosensory cortex), and loss (precuneus, middle/posterior
   cingular gyrus). This pattern of activation developed over time. While
   in the early phases of exposure lower association areas, such as the
   extrastriate body area, were active, in the late phases activation in
   parietal and temporal association areas and the prefrontal cortex was
   more prominent. These findings are consistent with the conventional and
   contextual character of iconographic material, and further differentiate
   it from emotionally negatively valenced and high-arousing stimuli. In
   future studies, this neuroimaging assay may be useful in characterizing
   interpretive appraisal of material of negative emotional valence.}},

Abstract = {{A growing body of literature demonstrates that racial group membership
   can influence neural responses, e.g. when individuals perceive or
   interact with persons of another race. However, little attention has
   been paid to social class, a factor that interacts with racial
   inequalities in American society. We extend previous literature on
   race-related neural activity by focusing on how the human brain responds
   to racial out-groups cast in positively valued social class positions vs
   less valued ones. We predicted that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
   (vmPFC) and the amygdala would have functionally dissociable roles, with
   the vmPFC playing a more significant role within socially valued
   in-groups (i.e. the middle-class) and the amygdala having a more crucial
   role for socially ambivalent and threatening categories (i.e. upper and
   lower class). We tested these predictions with two complementary
   studies: (i) a neuropsychological experiment with patients with the
   vmPFC or amygdala lesions, contrasted with brain damaged and normal
   comparison participants, and (ii) a functional magnetic resonance
   imaging experiment with 15 healthy adults. Our findings suggest that two
   distinct mechanisms underlie class-based racial evaluations, one
   engaging the vmPFC for positively identified in-group class and another
   recruiting the amygdala for the class groups that are marginalized or
   perceived as potential threats.}},

Abstract = {{Several theories conceptualise emotions along two main dimensions:
   valence (a continuum from negative to positive) and arousal (a continuum
   that varies from low to high). These dimensions are typically treated as
   independent in many neuroimaging experiments, yet recent behavioural
   findings suggest that they are actually interdependent. This result has
   impact on neuroimaging design, analysis and theoretical development. We
   were interested in determining the extent of this interdependence both
   behaviourally and neuroanatomically, as well as teasing apart any
   activation that is specific to each dimension. While we found extensive
   overlap in activation for each dimension in traditional emotion areas
   (bilateral insulae, orbitofrontal cortex, amygdalae), we also found
   activation specific to each dimension with characteristic relationships
   between modulations of these dimensions and BOLD signal change.
   Increases in arousal ratings were related to increased activations
   predominantly in voice-sensitive cortices after variance explained by
   valence had been removed. In contrast, emotions of extreme valence were
   related to increased activations in bilateral voice-sensitive cortices,
   hippocampi, anterior and midcingulum and medial orbito- and superior
   frontal regions after variance explained by arousal had been accounted
   for. Our results therefore do not support a complete segregation of
   brain structures underpinning the processing of affective dimensions.}},

Title = {{A functional MRI study on how oxytocin affects decision making in social
   dilemmas: Cooperate as long as it pays off, aggress only when you think
   you can win}},
Journal = {{HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{145-152}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We investigate if the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT), known to moderate
   social behaviour, influences strategic decision making in social
   dilemmas by facilitating the integration of incentives and social cues.
   Participants (N = 29) played two economic games with different incentive
   structures in the fMRI scanner after receiving OT or placebo (following
   a double blind, within-subject design). Pictures of angry or neutral
   faces (the social cues) were displayed alongside the game matrices.
   Consistent with a priori hypotheses based on the modulatory role of OT
   in mesolimbic dopaminergic brain regions, the results indicate that,
   compared to placebo, OT significantly increases the activation of the
   nucleus accumbens during an assurance (coordination) game that rewards
   mutual cooperation. This increases appetitive motivation so that
   cooperative behaviour is facilitated for risk averse individuals. OT
   also significantly attenuates the amygdala, thereby reducing the
   orienting response to social cues. The corresponding change in behaviour
   is only apparent in the chicken (or anti-coordination) game, where
   aggression is incentivized but fatal if the partner also aggresses.
   Because of this ambiguity, decision making can be improved by additional
   information, and OT steers decisions in the chicken game in accordance
   with the valence of the facial cue: aggress when face is neutral;
   retreat when it is angry. Through its combined influence on amygdala and
   nucleus accumbens, OT improves the selection of a cooperative or
   aggressive strategy in function of the best match between the incentives
   of the game and the social cues present in the decision environment. (C)

Title = {{The neural correlates of dealing with social exclusion in childhood}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{29-37}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Observing social exclusion can be a distressing experience for children
   that can be followed by concerns for self inclusion (self-concerns), as
   well as prosocial behavior to help others in distress (other-concerns).
   Indeed, behavioral studies have shown that observed social exclusion
   elicits prosocial compensating behavior in children, but motivations for
   the compensation of social exclusion are not well understood. To
   distinguish between self concerns and other-concerns when observing
   social exclusion in childhood, participants (aged 7-10) played a
   four-player Prosocial Cyberball Game in which they could toss a ball to
   three other players. When one player was excluded by the two other
   players, the participant could compensate for this exclusion by tossing
   the ball more often to the excluded player. Using a three-sample
   replication (N = 18, N = 27, and N = 26) and meta-analysis design, we
   demonstrated consistent prosocial compensating behavior in children in
   response to observing social exclusion. On a neural level, we found
   activity in reward and salience related areas (striatum and dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)) when participants experienced
   inclusion, and activity in social perception related areas
   (orbitofrontal cortex) when participants experienced exclusion. In
   contrast, no condition specific neural effects were observed for
   prosocial compensating behavior. These findings suggest that in
   childhood observed social exclusion is associated with stronger neural
   activity for self-concern. This study aims to overcome some of the
   issues of replicability in developmental psychology and neuroscience by
   using a replication and meta-analysis design, showing consistent
   prosocial compensating behavior to the excluded player, and replicable
   neural correlates of experiencing exclusion and inclusion during middle
   childhood.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) subjects focus on
   brain functional alterations in relation to antisocial behaviors.
   Neuroimaging research has identified a number of focal brain regions
   with abnormal structures or functions in ASPD. However, little is known
   about the connections among brain regions in terms of inter-regional
   whole-brain networks in ASPD patients, as well as possible alterations
   of brain functional topological organization. In this study, we employ
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) to examine
   functional connectome of 32 ASPD patients and 35 normal controls by
   using a variety of network properties, including small-worldness,
   modularity, and connectivity. The small-world analysis reveals that ASPD
   patients have increased path length and decreased network efficiency,
   which implies a reduced ability of global integration of whole-brain
   functions. Modularity analysis suggests ASPD patients have decreased
   overall modularity, merged network modules, and reduced intra- and
   inter-module connectivities related to frontal regions. Also,
   network-based statistics show that an internal sub-network, composed of
   16 nodes and 16 edges, is significantly affected in ASPD patients, where
   brain regions are mostly located in the fronto-parietal control network.
   These results suggest that ASPD is associated with both reduced brain
   integration and segregation in topological organization of functional
   brain networks, particularly in the fronto-parietal control network.
   These disruptions may contribute to disturbances in behavior and
   cognition in patients with ASPD. Our findings may provide insights into
   a deeper understanding of functional brain networks of ASPD.}},

Abstract = {{Guilt is a self-conscious emotion associated with the negative appraisal
   of one's behavior. In recent years, several neuroimaging studies have
   investigated the neural correlates of guilt, but no meta-analyses have
   yet identified the most robust activation patterns. A systematic review
   of literature found 16 functional magnetic resonance imaging studies
   with whole-brain analyses meeting the inclusion criteria, for a total of
   325 participants and 135 foci of activation. A meta-analysis was then
   conducted using activation likelihood estimation. Additionally,
   Meta-Analytic Connectivity Modeling (MACM) analysis was conducted to
   investigate the functional connectivity of significant clusters. The
   analysis revealed 12 significant clusters of brain activation
   (voxel-based FDR-corrected p < 0.05) located in the prefrontal, temporal
   and parietal regions, mainly in the left hemisphere. Only the left
   dorsal cingulate cluster survived stringent FWE correction (voxel-based
   p < 0.05). Secondary analyses (voxel-based FDR-corrected p < 0.05) on
   the 7 studies contrasting guilt with another emotional condition showed
   an association with clusters in the left precuneus, the anterior
   cingulate, the left medial frontal gyrus, the right superior frontal
   gyrus and the left superior temporal gyrus. MACM demonstrated that
   regions associated with guilt are highly interconnected. Our analysis
   identified a distributed neural network of left-lateralized regions
   associated with guilt. While voxel-based FDR-corrected results should be
   considered exploratory, the dorsal cingulate was robustly associated
   with guilt. We speculate that this network integrates cognitive and
   emotional processes involved in the experience of guilt, including
   self-representation, theory of mind, conflict monitoring and moral
   values. Limitations of our meta-analyses comprise the small sample size
   and the heterogeneity of included studies, and concerns about
   naturalistic validity.}},

Abstract = {{Every year in Europe 1.5 million patients suffer a new stroke. Despite
   the further developments in acute therapy with nationwide stroke units,
   thrombolysis, thrombectomy and post-acute neurorehabilitation, only a
   small proportion of patients recover to a satisfactory degree allowing
   them to return to their normal social and professional life. This makes
   stroke the main cause of long-term disability with a corresponding
   impact on patient lives, socioeconomics and the healthcare system. Thus,
   the concepts of neurorehabilitation have to be extended to enhance the
   effects of rehabilitative treatment strategies. To achieve this, an
   understanding of the prediction of the course of recovery, the
   mechanisms underlying functional recovery and factors influencing
   recovery have to be enhanced for the development towards
   patient-tailored precision medicine approaches. A central point towards
   this is the understanding of stroke as a disease, which not only
   influences the damaged area but also the associated network. This is

Abstract = {{Media's prevailing thin-body ideal plays a vital role in adolescent
   girls' body image development, but the co-occurring impact of peer
   feedback is understudied. The present study used functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) to test media imagery and peer feedback
   combinations on neural activity related to thin-body ideals. Twenty-four
   healthy female late adolescents rated precategorized body sizes of
   bikini models (too thin or normal), directly followed by ostensible peer
   feedback (too thin or normal). Consistent with prior studies on social
   feedback processing, results showed increased brain activity in the
   dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC)/anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
   and bilateral insula in incongruent situations: when participants rated
   media models' body size as normal while peer feedback indicated the
   models as too thin (or vice versa). This effect was stronger for girls
   with lower self-esteem. A subsequent behavioral study (N = 34 female
   late adolescents, separate sample) demonstrated that participants
   changed behavior in the direction of the peer feedback: precategorized
   normal sized models were rated as too thin more often after receiving
   too thin peer feedback. This suggests that the neural responses upon
   peer feedback may influence subsequent choice. Our results show that
   media-by-peer interactions have pronounced effects on girls' body
   ideals.}},

Abstract = {{Decades of research have established that decision-making is
   dramatically impacted by both the rewards an individual receives and the
   behavior of others. How do these distinct influences exert their
   influence on an individual's actions, and can the resulting behavior be
   effectively captured in a computational model? To address this question,
   we employed a novel spatial foraging game in which groups of three
   participants sought to find the most rewarding location in an unfamiliar
   two-dimensional space. As the game transitioned from one block to the
   next, the availability of information regarding other group members was
   varied systematically, revealing the relative impacts of feedback from
   the environment and information from other group members on individual
   decision-making. Both reward-based and socially-based sources of
   information exerted a significant influence on behavior, and a
   computational model incorporating these effects was able to recapitulate
   several key trends in the behavioral data. In addition, our findings
   suggest how these sources were processed and combined during
   decision-making. Analysis of reaction time, location of gaze, and
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data indicated that these
   distinct sources of information were integrated simultaneously for each
   decision, rather than exerting their influence in a separate,
   all-or-none fashion across separate subsets of trials. These findings
   add to our understanding of how the separate influences of reward from
   the environment and information derived from other social agents are
   combined to produce decisions.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{152-175}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents substantial evidence of a simple social tie
   mechanism that endogenizes people's care about other individuals under
   the influence of interaction experiences. The mechanism is rooted in
   scientific studies from various disciplines. For our evidence, we
   propose and estimate a dynamic model of tie formation using different
   experimental data sets regarding public goods, test its within-sample
   and out-of-sample predictive performance, and compare it with other
   models. In addition to the support obtained for the mechanism, we find
   that the effects of interaction experiences show substantial persistence
   over time, and that only a minority looks ahead to strategically
   influence the behavior of interaction partners. Furthermore, our model
   appears to track the often volatile behavioral dynamics of the different
   datasets remarkably well. Additional evidence is presented of a neural
   substrate of the tie mechanism, based on a recent (fMRI) application of
   the estimated model, and of the explanatory power of our model regarding
   other extant experimental findings. Implications for private and public
   governance and topics for future research are discussed. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{The concept of free will has been heavily debated in philosophy and the
   social sciences. Its alleged importance lies in its association with
   phenomena fundamental to our understandings of self, such as autonomy,
   freedom, self-control, agency, and moral responsibility. Consequently,
   when neuroscience research is interpreted as challenging or even
   invalidating this concept, a number of heated social and ethical debates
   surface. We undertook a content analysis of media coverage of Libet's et
   al.'s (Brain 106(Pt 3):623-642, 1983) landmark study, which is
   frequently interpreted as posing a serious challenge to the existence of
   free will. Media descriptions of Libet et al.'s experiment provided
   limited details about the original study. Overall, many media articles
   reported that Libet et al.'s experiments undermined the existence of
   free will, despite acknowledging that several methodological limitations
   had been identified in the literature. A propensity to attribute greater
   credibility than warranted to neurobiological explanations could be at
   stake.}},

Title = {{Electrophysiological signals associated with fluency of different levels
   of processing reveal multiple contributions to recognition memory}},
Journal = {{CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{1-13}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Processing fluency appears to influence recognition memory judgements,
   and the manipulation of fluency, if misattributed to an effect of prior
   exposure, can result in illusory memory. Although it is well established
   that fluency induced by masked repetition priming leads to increased
   familiarity, manipulations of conceptual fluency have produced
   conflicting results, variously affecting familiarity or recollection.
   Some recent studies have found that masked conceptual priming increases
   correct recollection (Taylor \& Henson, 2012), and the magnitude of this
   behavioural effect correlates with analogous fMRI BOLD priming effects
   in brain regions associated with recollection (Taylor, Buratto,
   \&Henson, 2013). However, the neural correlates and time-courses of
   masked repetition and conceptual priming were not compared directly in
   previous studies. The present study used event-related potentials (ERPs)
   to identify and compare the electrophysiological correlates of masked
   repetition and conceptual priming and investigate how they contribute to
   recognition memory. Behavioural results were consistent with previous
   studies: Repetition primes increased familiarity, whereas conceptual
   primes increased correct recollection. Masked repetition and conceptual
   priming also decreased the latency of late parietal component (LPC).
   Masked repetition priming was associated with an early P200 effect and a
   later parietal maximum N400 effect, whereas masked conceptual priming
   was only associated with a central-parietal maximum N400 effect. In
   addition, the topographic distributions of the N400 repetition priming
   and conceptual priming effects were different. These results suggest
   that fluency at different levels of processing is associated with
   different ERP components, and contributes differentially to subjective
   recognition memory experiences.}},

Title = {{Using guitar learning to probe the Action Observation Network's response
   to visuomotor familiarity}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{156}},
Pages = {{174-189}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Watching other people move elicits engagement of a collection of
   sensorimotor brain regions collectively termed the Action Observation
   Network (AON). An extensive literature documents more robust AON
   responses when observing or executing familiar compared to unfamiliar
   actions, as well as a positive correlation between amplitude of AON
   response and an observer's familiarity with an observed or executed
   movement. On the other hand, emerging evidence shows patterns of AON
   activity counter to these findings, whereby in some circumstances,
   unfamiliar actions lead to greater AON engagement than familiar actions.
   In an attempt to reconcile these conflicting findings, some have
   proposed that the relationship between AON response amplitude and action
   familiarity is nonlinear in nature. In the present study, we used an
   elaborate guitar training intervention to probe the relationship between
   movement familiarity and AON engagement during action execution and
   action observation tasks. Participants underwent fMRI scanning while
   executing one set of guitar sequences with a scanner-compatible bass
   guitar and observing a second set of sequences. Participants then
   acquired further physical practice or observational experience with half
   of these stimuli outside the scanner across 3 days. Participants then
   returned for an identical scanning session, wherein they executed and
   observed equal numbers of familiar (trained) and unfamiliar (untrained)
   guitar sequences. Via region of interest analyses, we extracted activity
   within AON regions engaged during both scanning sessions, and then fit
   linear, quadratic and cubic regression models to these data. The data
   best support the cubic regression models, suggesting that the response
   profile within key sensorimotor brain regions associated with the AON
   respond to action familiarity in a nonlinear manner. Moreover, by
   probing the subjective nature of the prediction error signal, we show
   results consistent with a predictive coding account of AON engagement
   during action observation and execution that also takes into account
   effects of changes in neural efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Self-improvement motivation, which occurs when individuals seek to
   improve upon their competence by gaining new knowledge and improving
   upon their skills, is critical for cognitive, social, and educational
   adjustment. While many studies have delineated the neural mechanisms
   supporting extrinsic motivation induced by monetary rewards, less work
   has examined the neural processes that support intrinsically motivated
   behaviors, such as self-improvement motivation. Because cultural groups
   traditionally vary in terms of their self-improvement motivation, we
   examined cultural differences in the behavioral and neural processes
   underlying motivated behaviors during cognitive persistence in the
   absence of extrinsic rewards. In Study 1, 71 American (47 females,
   M=19.68 years) and 68 Chinese (38 females, M=19.37 years) students
   completed a behavioral cognitive control task that required cognitive
   persistence across time. In Study 2, 14 American and 15 Chinese students
   completed the same cognitive persistence task during an fMRI scan.
   Across both studies, American students showed significant declines in
   cognitive performance across time, whereas Chinese participants
   demonstrated effective cognitive persistence. These behavioral effects
   were explained by cultural differences in self-improvement motivation
   and paralleled by increasing activation and functional coupling between
   the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and ventral striatum (VS) across the
   task among Chinese participants, neural activation and coupling that
   remained low in American participants. These findings suggest a
   potential neural mechanism by which the VS and IFG work in concert to
   promote cognitive persistence in the absence of extrinsic rewards. Thus,
   frontostriatal circuitry may be a neurobiological signal representing
   intrinsic motivation for self-improvement that serves an adaptive
   function, increasing Chinese students' motivation to engage in cognitive
   persistence.}},

Abstract = {{During competitive interactions, humans have to estimate the impact of
   their own actions on their opponent's strategy. Here we provide evidence
   that neural computations in the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ)
   and interconnected structures are causally involved in this process. By
   combining inhibitory continuous theta-burst transcranial magnetic
   stimulation with model-based functional MRI, we show that disrupting
   neural excitability in the rTPJ reduces behavioral and neural indices of
   mentalizing-related computations, as well as functional connectivity of
   the rTPJ with ventral and dorsal parts of the medial prefrontal cortex.
   These results provide a causal demonstration that neural computations
   instantiated in the rTPJ are neurobiological prerequisites for the
   ability to integrate opponent beliefs into strategic choice, through
   system-level interaction within the valuation and mentalizing networks.}},

Abstract = {{A considerable portion of chronic low back pain (cLBP) patients lack
   anatomical abnormality, resist conventional therapeutic interventions,
   and their symptoms are often complicated with psychological and social
   factors. Such patients have been reported to show cerebral abnormalities
   both in anatomy and function by neuroimaging studies. Here we examined
   differences in cerebral reactivity to a simulated low back pain stimulus
   between cLBP patients and healthy controls by functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI), and their behavioral correlates from a
   psychophysical questionnaire.
   Eleven cLBP patients and 13 healthy subjects (HS) were enrolled in this
   study. After psychophysical evaluation on-going pain with McGill Pain
   Questionnaire Short Form (MPQ), they underwent whole-brain fMRI in a
   3-Tesla MRI scanner while receiving three blocks of 30-s mechanical pain
   stimuli at the left low back with a 30-s rest in between, followed by a
   three-dimensional anatomical imaging. Functional images were analyzed
   with a multi-subject general linear model for blood oxygenation
   level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes associated with pain. Individual
   BOLD signal amplitudes at activated clusters were examined for
   correlation with psychophysical variables. Two in the cLBP and five data
   sets in the HS groups were excluded from analysis because of deficient
   or artifactual data or mismatch in age.
   The HS group showed LBP-related activation at the right insular cortex,
   right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), left anterior cingulate
   cortex (ACC), and left precuneus; and deactivation in a large area over
   the parietal and occipital cortices, including the bilateral superior
   parietal cortex. On the other hand, the cLBP group did not show any
   significant activation at those cortical areas, but showed similar
   deactivation at the bilateral superior parietal cortex and part of the
   premotor area. An HS > cLBP contrast revealed significantly less
   activity at the ACC and DLPFC in the cLBP group, which was negatively
   correlated with higher MPQ scores.
   The cLBP patients showed attenuated reactivity to pain at the ACC and
   DLPFC, known cortical areas mediating affective component, and top-down
   modulation, of pain. The present results might be associated with
   possible dysfunction of the descending pain inhibitory system in
   patients with chronic low back pain, which might possibly play a role in
   chronification of pain.}},

Abstract = {{The default mode network (DMN), a network centered around the cortical
   midline, shows deactivation during most cognitive tasks and pronounced
   resting-state connectivity, but is actively engaged in self-reference
   and social cognition. It is, however, yet unclear how information
   reaches the DMN during social cognitive processing. Here, we addressed
   this question using dynamic causal modeling (DCM) of functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired during self-reference (SR) and
   reference to others (OR). Both conditions engaged the left inferior
   frontal gyrus (LIFG), most likely reflecting semantic processing. Within
   the DMN, self-reference preferentially elicited rostral anterior
   cingulate and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (rACC/vmPFC) activity,
   whereas OR engaged posterior cingulate and precuneus (PCC/PreCun). DCM
   revealed that the regulation of information flow to the DMN was
   primarily inhibitory. Most prominently, SR elicited inhibited
   information flow from the LIFG to the PCC/PreCun, while OR was
   associated with suppression of the connectivity from the LIFG to the
   rACC/vmPFC. These results suggest that task-related DMN activation is
   enabled by inhibitory downregulation of task-irrelevant information flow
   when switching from rest to stimulus-specific processing.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies have shown that seeing others in pain activates
   brain regions that are involved in first-hand pain, suggesting that
   shared neuromolecular pathways support processing of first-hand and
   vicarious pain. We tested whether the dopamine and opioid
   neurotransmitter systems involved in nociceptive processing also
   contribute to vicarious pain experience. We used in vivo positron
   emission tomography to quantify type 2 dopamine and mu-opioid receptor
   (D2R and MOR, respectively) availabilities in brains of 35 subjects.
   During functional magnetic resonance imaging, the subjects watched short
   movie clips depicting persons in painful and painless situations.
   Painful scenes activated pain-responsive brain regions including
   anterior insulae, thalamus and secondary somatosensory cortices, as well
   as posterior superior temporal sulci. MOR availability correlated
   negatively with the haemodynamic responses during painful scenes in
   anterior and posterior insulae, thalamus, secondary and primary
   somatosensory cortices, primary motor cortex, and superior temporal
   sulci. MOR availability correlated positively with orbitofrontal
   haemodynamic responses during painful scenes. D2R availability was not
   correlated with the haemodynamic responses in any brain region. These
   results suggest that the opioid system contributes to neural processing
   of vicarious pain, and that interindividual differences in opioidergic
   system could explain why some individuals react more strongly than
   others to seeing pain.}},

Abstract = {{The pathophysiology of primary progressive aphasias remains poorly
   understood. Here, we addressed this issue using activation fMRI in a
   cohort of 27 patients with primary progressive aphasia (nonfluent,
   semantic, and logopenic variants) versus 15 healthy controls.
   Participants listened passively to sequences of spoken syllables in
   which we manipulated 3- key auditory speech signal characteristics:
   temporal regularity, phonemic spectral structure, and pitch sequence
   entropy. Relative to healthy controls, nonfluent variant patients showed
   reduced activation of medial Heschl's gyrus in response to any auditory
   stimulation and reduced activation of anterior cingulate to temporal
   irregularity. Semantic variant patients had relatively reduced
   activation of caudate and anterior cingulate in response to increased
   entropy. Logopenic variant patients showed reduced activation of
   posterior superior temporal cortex to phonemic spectral structure. Taken
   together, our findings suggest that impaired processing of core speech
   signal attributes may drive particular progressive aphasia syndromes and
   could index a generic physiological mechanism of reduced computational
   efficiency relevant to all these syndromes, with implications for
   development of new biomarkers and therapeutic interventions. (C) 2017

Title = {{Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy diminishes functional connectivity during
   emotion perception}},
Journal = {{EPILEPSY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{33-40}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Unilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) has been
   associated with impaired recognition of emotional facial expressions.
   Correspondingly, imaging studies showed decreased activity of the
   amygdala and cortical face processing regions in response to emotional
   faces. However, functional connectivity among regions involved in
   emotion perception has not been studied so far.
   Methods: To address this, we examined intrinsic functional connectivity
   (FC) modulated by the perception of dynamic fearful faces among the
   amygdala and limbic, frontal, temporal and brainstem regions. Regions of
   interest were identified in an activation analysis by presenting a
   block-design with dynamic fearful faces and dynamic landscapes to 15
   healthy individuals. This led to 10 predominately right-hemispheric
   regions. Functional connectivity between these regions during the
   perception of fearful faces was examined in drug refractory patients
   with left- (n = 16) or right-sided (n = 17) MTLE, epilepsy patients with
   extratemporal seizure onset (n = 15) and a second group of 15 healthy
   controls.
   Results: Healthy controls showed a widespread functional network
   modulated by the perception of fearful faces that encompassed bilateral
   amygdalae, limbic, cortical, subcortical and brainstem regions. In
   patients with left MTLE, a downsized network of frontal and temporal
   regions centered on the right amygdala was present. Patients with right
   MTLE showed almost no significant functional connectivity. A maintained
   network in the epilepsy control group indicates that findings in mesial
   temporal lobe epilepsy could not be explained by clinical factors such
   as seizures and antiepileptic medication.
   Conclusion: Functional networks underlying facial emotion perception are
   considerably changed in left and right MTLE. Alterations are present for
   both hemispheres in either MTLE group, but are more pronounced in right
   MTLE. Disruption of the functional network architecture possibly
   contributes to deficits in facial emotion recognition frequently
   reported in MTLE.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research suggests a role of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex
   (dmPFC) in metacognitive representation of social information, while the
   right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) has been linked to
   social perception. This study targeted these functional roles in the
   context of spontaneous mentalizing. An animated shapes task was
   presented to 46 subjects during functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   Stimuli consisted of video clips depicting animated shapes whose
   movement patterns prompt spontaneous mentalizing or simple intention
   attribution. Based on their differential response during spontaneous
   mentalizing, both regions were characterized with respect to their
   task-dependent connectivity profiles and their associations with
   autistic traits. Functional network analyses revealed highly localized
   coupling of the right pSTS with visual areas in the lateral occipital
   cortex, while the dmPFC showed extensive coupling with instances of
   large-scale control networks and temporal areas including the right
   pSTS. Autistic traits were related to mentalizing-specific activation of
   the dmPFC and to the strength of connectivity between the dmPFC and
   posterior temporal regions. These results are in good agreement with the
   hypothesized roles of the dmPFC and right pSTS for metacognitive
   representation and perception-based processing of social information,
   respectively, and further inform their implication in social behavior
   linked to autism. Hum Brain Mapp 38:3791-3803, 2017. (c) 2017 Wiley

Abstract = {{Biomarkers represent a critical research area in neurodegeneration
   disease as they can contribute to studying potential disease-modifying
   agents, fostering timely therapeutic interventions, and alleviating
   associated financial costs. Functional connectivity (FC) analysis
   represents a promising approach to identify early biomarkers in specific
   diseases. Yet, virtually no study has tested whether potential FC
   biomarkers prove to be reliable and reproducible across different
   centers. As such, their implementation remains uncertain due to multiple
   sources of variability across studies: the numerous international
   centers capable conducting FC research vary in their scanning equipment
   and their samples' socio-cultural background, and, more troublingly
   still, no gold-standard method exists to analyze FC. In this
   unprecedented study, we aim to address both issues by performing the
   first multicenter FC research in the behavioral-variant frontotemporal
   dementia (bvFTD), and by assessing multiple FC approaches to propose a
   gold-standard method for analysis. We enrolled 52 bvFTD patients and 60
   controls from three international clinics (with different fMRI recording
   parameters), and three additional neurological patient groups. To
   evaluate FC, we focused on seed analysis, inter-regional connectivity,
   and several graph-theory approaches. Only graph-theory analysis, based
   on weighted-matrices, yielded consistent differences between bvFTD and
   controls across centers. Also, graph metrics robustly discriminated
   bvFTD from the other neurological conditions. The consistency of our
   findings across heterogeneous contexts highlights graph-theory as a
   potential gold-standard approach for brain network analysis in bvFTD.

Abstract = {{Communication involves successfully deriving a speaker's meaning beyond
   the literal expression. Using fMRI, it was investigated how the
   listener's brain realizes distinctions between enrichment-based meanings
   and literal semantic meanings. The neural patterns of the Mandarin
   scalar quantifier you-de (similar to some in English) which implies the
   meanings not all and not most via scalar enrichment, with the specific
   quantifier shao-shu-de (similar to less than half in English) which
   lexico-semantically encodes the meanings not all and not most, were
   compared. Listeners heard sentences using either quantifier, paired with
   pictures in which either less than half, more than half, or all of the
   people depicted in the picture were doing the described activity; thus,
   the conditions included both implicature-based and semantics-based
   picture-sentence mismatches. Imaging results showed bilateral ventral
   IFG was activated for both kinds of mismatch, whereas basal ganglia and
   left dorsal IFG were activated uniquely for implicature-based mismatch.
   These findings suggest that resolving conflicts involving inferential
   aspects of meaning employs different neural mechanisms than the
   processing based on literal semantic meaning, and that the dorsal
   prefrontal/basal ganglia pathway makes a contribution to
   implicature-based interpretation. Furthermore, within the
   implicature-based conditions, different neural generators were
   implicated in the processing of strong implicature mismatch (you-de in
   the context of a picture in which all would have been true) and weak
   implicature mismatch (you-de in the context of a picture in which most
   would have been true), which may have important implications for
   theories of pragmatic comprehension. Hum Brain Mapp 38:3848-3864, 2017.

Abstract = {{Classical delay eyeblink conditioning is likely the most commonly used
   paradigm to study cerebellar learning. As yet, few studies have focused
   on extinction and savings of conditioned eyeblink responses (CRs).
   Saving effects, which are reflected in a reacquisition after extinction
   that is faster than the initial acquisition, suggest that learned
   associations are at least partly preserved during extinction. In this
   study, we tested the hypothesis that acquisition-related plasticity is
   nihilated during extinction in the cerebellar cortex, but retained in
   the cerebellar nuclei, allowing for faster reacquisition. Changes of 7 T
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals were investigated
   in the cerebellar cortex and nuclei of young and healthy human subjects.
   Main effects of acquisition, extinction, and reacquisition against rest
   were calculated in conditioned stimulus-only trials. First-level values
   were determined for a spherical region of interest (ROI) around the
   acquisition peak voxel in lobule VI, and dentate and interposed nuclei
   ipsilateral to the unconditioned stimulus. In the cerebellar cortex and
   nuclei, fMRI signals were significantly lower in extinction compared to
   acquisition and reacquisition, but not significantly different between
   acquisition and reacquisition. These findings are consistent with the
   theory of bidirectional learning in both the cerebellar cortex and
   nuclei. It cannot explain, however, why conditioned responses reappear
   almost immediately in reacquisition following extinction. Although the
   present data do not exclude that part of the initial memory remains in
   the cerebellum in extinction, future studies should also explore changes
   in extracerebellar regions as a potential substrate of saving effects.

Abstract = {{Mindfulness has been shown to reduce stress, promote health, and
   well-being, as well as to increase compassionate behavior toward others.
   It reduces distress to one's own painful experiences, going along with
   altered neural responses, by enhancing self-regulatory processes and
   decreasing emotional reactivity. In order to investigate if mindfulness
   similarly reduces distress and neural activations associated with
   empathy for others' socially painful experiences, which might in the
   following more strongly motivate prosocial behavior, the present study
   compared trait, and state effects of long-term mindfulness meditation
   (LTM) practice. To do so we acquired behavioral data and neural activity
   measures using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an
   empathy for social pain task while manipulating the meditation state
   between two groups of LTM practitioners that were matched with a control
   group. The results show increased activations of the anterior insula
   (AI) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as well as the medial
   prefrontal cortex and temporal pole when sharing others' social
   suffering, both in LTM practitioners and controls. However, in LTM
   practitioners, who practiced mindfulness meditation just prior to
   observing others' social pain, left AI activation was lower and the
   strength of AI activation following the mindfulness meditation was
   negatively associated with trait compassion in LTM practitioners. The
   findings suggest that current mindfulness meditation could provide an
   adaptive mechanism in coping with distress due to the empathic sharing
   of others' suffering, thereby possibly enabling compassionate behavior.

Abstract = {{Cervical dystonia (CD) is a neurological disorder with typical symptoms
   of involuntary and abnormal movements and postures of the head.
   CD-associated alterations of functional brain networks have not been
   well characterized. Previous studies of CD using resting-state
   functional MRI (rfMRI) are limited in two aspects: (i) the analyses were
   not directly focused on the functional brain network related to head
   movement and (ii) rfMRI measurements other than functional connectivity
   (FC) were not investigated. The present study examined alterations of FC
   in CD by capitalizing on newly identified brain regions supporting
   isometric head rotation (Prudente et al.: J Neurosci 35 (2015)
   9163-9172). In addition to FC, which only reflects inter-regional signal
   synchronization, local, or intraregional alterations were also examined
   using rfMRI measurements of the fractional amplitude of low-frequency
   fluctuations and regional homogeneity (ReHo). Finally, with alterations
   of different rfMRI measures identified, a support vector machine (SVM)
   learning algorithm was implemented for group classification. The results
   revealed both inter- (FC) and intra-regional (ReHo) alterations
   extensively distributed in both cortical and subcortical structures; and
   common alterations of these measures were identified bilaterally in the
   postcentral gyrus as well as in the basal ganglia and thalamus. Of the
   rfMRI features examined, seven of them (four FC and three ReHo measures)
   survived the SVM procedure of recursive feature elimination and together
   provided the highest group classification accuracy of 90.6\%. The
   present findings extend previous studies of rfMRI in CD and offer
   insight into the underlying pathophysiology of the disorder in relation
   to network dysfunction and somatosensory disturbances. Hum Brain Mapp

Abstract = {{Memories associated with the self are remembered more accurately than
   those associated with others. The memory enhancement related to the self
   is known as the self-reference effect (SRE). However, little is known
   regarding the neural mechanisms underlying the SRE in a social context
   modulated by social relationships. In the present fMRI study, we
   investigated encoding-related activation of face memories encoded with
   the self-referential process in a social context that was manipulated by
   imagining a person-to-person relationship. Healthy young adults
   participated in the present study. During encoding, participants encoded
   unfamiliar target faces by imagining a future friendship with themselves
   (Self), their friends (Friend), or strangers (Other). During retrieval,
   participants were presented with target and distracter faces one by one,
   and they judged whether each face had been previously learned. In the
   behavioral results, target faces encoded in the Self condition were
   remembered more accurately than those encoded in the Other condition.
   fMRI results demonstrated that encoding-related activation in the medial
   prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was significantly greater in the Self condition
   than in the Friend or Other conditions. In addition, the generalized
   psycho-physiological interaction (gPPI) analysis showed that functional
   connectivity between activation in the hippocampus and the cortical
   midline structures (CMSs), including the mPFC and precuneus, was
   significant in the Self but not in the Other condition. These findings
   suggest that the SRE in a social context could be involved in the
   interaction between the CMS regions, which are related to the
   self-referential process, and the hippocampus related to the memory
   process. Hum Brain Mapp 38:4256-4269, 2017. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals,

   their performance to that of patients with left temporal lobe epilepsy
   (LTLE).
   Methods: 74 pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients were
   evaluated: 34 with RTLE and 40 with LTLE. Subjects underwent a battery
   of tests that measure comprehension and production of conversational and
   narrative discourse. Disease related variables and general
   neuropsychological data were evaluated.
   Results: The RTLE group presented deficits in interictal conversational
   and narrative discourse, with a disintegrated speech, lack of
   categorization and misinterpretation of social meaning. LTLE group, on
   the other hand, showed a tendency to lower performance in
   logical-temporal sequencing.
   Significance: RTLE patients showed discourse deficits which have been
   described in right hemisphere damaged patients due to other etiologies.
   Medial and anterior temporal lobe structures appear to link semantic,
   world knowledge, and social cognition associated areas to construct a
   contextually related coherent meaning. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Contextual relevance, which is vital for understanding conversational
   implicatures (CI), engages both the frontal-temporal language and
   theory-of-mind networks. Here we investigate how contextual relevance
   affects CI processing and regulates the connectivity between
   Cl-processing-related brain regions. Participants listened to dialogues
   in which the level of contextual relevance to dialogue-final utterance
   (reply) was manipulated. This utterance was either direct, indirect but
   relevant, irrelevant with contextual hint, or irrelevant with no
   contextual hint. Results indicated that compared with direct replies,
   indirect replies showed increased activations in bilateral IFG,
   bilateral MTG, bilateral TPJ, dmPFC, and precuneus, and increased
   connectivity between rTPJ/dmPFC and both IFG and MTG. Moreover,
   irrelevant replies activated right MTG along an anterior-posterior
   gradient as a function of the level of irrelevance. Our study provides
   novel evidence concerning how the language and theory-of-mind networks
   interact for pragmatic inference and how the processing of CI is
   modulated by level of contextual relevance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{Dissociated neural basis of two behavioral hallmarks of holistic face
   processing: The whole-part effect and composite-face effect}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{102}},
Pages = {{52-60}},
Month = {{JUL 28}},
Abstract = {{It has been long proposed that our extraordinary face recognition
   ability stems from holistic face processing. Two widely-used behavioral
   hallmarks of holistic face processing are the whole-part effect (WPE)
   and composite-face effect (CFE). However, it remains unknown whether
   these two effects reflect similar or different aspects of holistic face
   processing. Here we investigated this question by examining whether the
   WPE and CFE involved shared or distinct neural substrates in a large
   sample of participants (N = 200). We found that the WPE and CFE showed
   hemispheric dissociation in the fusiform face area (FFA), that is, the
   WPE was correlated with face selectivity in the left FFA, while the CFE
   was correlated with face selectivity in the right FFA. Further, the
   correlation between the WPE and face selectivity was largely driven by
   the FFA response to faces, whereas the association between the CFE and
   face selectivity resulted from suppressed response to objects in the
   right FFA. Finally, we also observed dissociated correlation patterns of
   the WPE and CFE in other face-selective regions and across the whole
   brain. These results suggest that the WPE and CFE may reflect different
   aspects of holistic face processing, which shed new light on the
   behavioral dissociations of these two effects demonstrated in
   literature.}},

Title = {{Neural networks underlying language and social cognition during

Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{102}},
Pages = {{116-123}},

Abstract = {{The social communication impairments defining autism spectrum disorders
   (ASD) may be built upon core deficits in perspective-taking, language
   processing, and self-other representation. Self-referential processing
   entails the ability to incorporate self-awareness, self-judgment, and
   self-memory in information processing. Very few studies have examined
   the neural bases of integrating self-other representation and semantic
   processing in individuals with ASD. The main objective of this
   functional MRI study is to examine the role of language and social brain
   networks in self-other processing in young adults with ASD. Nineteen
   high-functioning male adults with ASD and 19age-sex-and-IQ-matched
   typically developing (TD) control participants made ``yes{''} or
   ``no{''} judgments of whether an adjective, presented visually,
   described them (self) or their favorite teacher (other). Both ASD and TD
   participants showed significantly increased activity in the medial
   prefrontal cortex (MPFC) during self and other processing relative to
   letter search. Analyses of group differences revealed significantly
   reduced activity in left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG), and left
   inferior parietal lobule (LIPL) in ASD participants, relative to TD
   controls. ASD participants also showed significantly weaker functional
   connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) with several brain
   areas while processing self-related words. The LIFG and IPL are
   important regions functionally at the intersection of language and
   social roles; reduced recruitment of these regions in ASD participants
   may suggest poor level of semantic and social processing. In addition,
   poor connectivity of the ACC may suggest the difficulty in meeting the
   linguistic and social demands of this task in ASD. Overall, this study
   provides new evidence of the altered recruitment of the neural networks
   underlying language and social cognition in ASD.}},

Title = {{Balanced bifrontal transcranial direct current stimulation enhances
   working memory in adults with high-functioning autism: a sham-controlled
   crossover study}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR AUTISM}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Background: Working memory (WM) often is impaired in autism spectrum
   disorder (ASD). Such impairment may underlie core deficits in cognition
   and social functioning. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
   has been shown to enhance WM in both healthy adults and clinical
   populations, but its efficacy in ASD is unknown. We predicted that
   bifrontal tDCS would improve WM performances of adults with
   high-functioning autism during active stimulation compared to sham
   stimulation and that such enhancement would generalize to an untrained
   task.
   Methods: Twelve adults with high-functioning ASD engaged in a battery of
   WM tasks that included backward spatial span, backward digit span,
   spatial n-back and letter n-back. While engaged, 40 min of 1.5 mA
   bifrontal stimulation was applied over the left and the right
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC). Using a single-blind crossover
   design, each participant received left anodal/right cathodal
   stimulation, right anodal/left cathodal stimulation, or sham
   stimulation, in randomized counterbalanced order on three separate days.
   Following tDCS, participants again engaged in letter and spatial n back
   tasks before taking the Brief Test of Attention (BTA). We used
   repeated-measures ANOVA to compare overall performance on the WM battery
   as measured by a composite of z-scores for all five measures. Post hoc
   ANOVAs, t tests, Friedman's tests, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were
   used to measure the online and offline effects of tDCS and to assess
   performances on individual measures.
   Results: Compared to sham stimulation, both left DLPFC anodal
   stimulation (t(11) = 5.4, p = 0.0002) and right DLPFC anodal stimulation
   (t(11) = 3.57, p = 0.004) improved overall WM performance. Left anodal
   stimulation (t(11) = 3.9, p = 0.003) and right anodal stimulation (t(11)
   = 2.7, p = 0.019) enhanced performances during stimulation. Enhancement
   transferred to an untrained task 50 min after right anodal stimulation
   (z(11) = 2.263, p = 0.024). The tasks that showed the largest effects of
   active stimulation were spatial span backward (z(11) = 2.39, p = 0.017)
   and BTA (z(11) = 2.263, p = 0.024).
   Conclusions: In adults with high-functioning ASD, active bifrontal tDCS
   given during WM tasks appears to improve performance. TDCS benefits also
   transferred to an untrained task completed shortly after stimulation.
   These results suggest that tDCS can improve WM task performance and
   could reduce some core deficits of autism.}},

Abstract = {{Cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit has been implicated in
   OCD pathophysiology by converging neuroimaging findings. The anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC), as an important part within CSTC circuit, plays
   a critical role in OCD etiology. The ACC can be divided into dorsal and
   rostral parts anatomically, which are involved in cognitive process and
   emotional function, respectively. However, the diverse function of
   intrinsic signals from dorsal and rostral ACC regions remains unclear in
   OCD study. In this work, we applied resting-state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) technology to investigate and differentiate
   the functional connectivity (FC) characteristics between dACC and rACC
   in unmedicated OCD patients. Also, the correlation between the altered
   FC and clinical symptom severity was analyzed. Decreased FC of
   rACC-DLPFC and increased FC between dACC and caudate were found.
   Moreover, the altered dACC-caudate FC was positively correlated with
   total Y-BOCS and compulsion score in OCD patients. Our findings implied
   the crossed function of dorsal and rostra( circuits in the
   pathophysiologic mechanism of OCD. The dorsal cingulate-striatum
   functional pathway served as a potential biomarker for OCD
   symptomatology and merits further investigations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Abstract = {{Bariatric surgery is an effective method to rapidly induce weight loss
   in severely obese people, however its impact on brain functional
   connectivity after longer periods of follow-up is yet to be assessed. We
   investigated changes in connectivity in 16 severely obese women one
   month before, one month after and one year after Roux-en-Y gastric
   bypass surgery (RYGB). 12 lean controls were also enrolled.
   Resting-state fMRI was acquired for all participants following an
   overnight fast and after a 260 kcal load. Connectivity between regions
   involved in food-related saliency attribution and reward-driven eating
   behavior was stronger in presurgery patients compared to controls, but
   progressively weakened after follow-up. At one year, changes in networks
   related to cognitive control over eating and bodily perception also
   occurred. Connectivity between regions involved in emotional control and
   social cognition had a temporary reduction early after treatment but had
   increased again after one year of follow-up. Furthermore, we could
   predict the BMI loss by presurgery connectivity in areas linked to
   emotional control and social interaction. RYGBP seems to reshape brain
   functional connectivity, early affecting cognitive control over eating,
   and these changes could be an important part of the therapeutic effect
   of bariatric surgery.}},

Title = {{Failure in Cognitive Suppression of Negative Affect in Adolescents with
   Generalized Anxiety Disorder}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 26}},
Abstract = {{Hyperactivity of limbic (e.g., amygdalar) responses to negative stimuli
   has been implicated in the pathophysiology of generalized anxiety
   disorder (GAD). Evidence has also suggested that even a simple cognitive
   task involving emotionally salient stimuli can modulate limbic and
   prefrontal neural activation. However, whether neural modulation of
   emotional stimulus processing in a cognitive task is defective in
   adolescents with GAD has not yet been investigated. In this study, 20
   adolescents with GAD and 14 comparable healthy controls underwent
   event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) coupled with
   an emotional valence evaluation task. During the evaluation of negative
   versus neutral stimuli, we found significant activation of the right
   inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in healthy controls, while the bilateral
   amygdala was activated in GAD patients. Between-group analyses showed
   dramatically reduced task-activation of the right IFG in GAD patients,
   and the magnitude of IFG activity negatively correlated with symptom
   severity. Psychophysiological interaction analysis further revealed
   significantly decreased functional interaction between right IFG and
   anterior cingulate cortex and ventromedial prefrontal cortex in GAD
   patients compared with healthy controls. Taken together, our findings
   show failure to suppress negative affect by recruiting a cognitive
   distraction in adolescents with GAD, providing new insights into the
   pathophysiology of GAD.}},

Title = {{Collaborative roles of Temporoparietal Junction and Dorsolateral
   Prefrontal Cortex in Different Types of Behavioural Flexibility}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 25}},
Abstract = {{Behavioural flexibility is essential for everyday life. This involves
   shifting attention between different perspectives. Previous studies
   suggest that flexibility is mainly subserved by the dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). However, although rarely emphasized, the
   temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is frequently recruited during flexible
   behaviour. A crucial question is whether TPJ plays a role in different
   types of flexibility, compared to its limited role in perceptual
   flexibility. We hypothesized that TPJ activity during diverse
   flexibility tasks plays a common role in stimulus-driven
   attention-shifting, thereby contributing to different types of
   flexibility, and thus the collaboration between DLPFC and TPJ might
   serve as a more appropriate mechanism than DLPFC alone. We used fMRI to
   measure DLPFC/TPJ activity recruited during moral flexibility, and
   examined its effect on other domains of flexibility
   (economic/perceptual). Here, we show the additional, yet crucial role of
   TPJ: a combined DLPFC/TPJ activity predicted flexibility, regardless of
   domain. Different types of flexibility might rely on more basic
   attention-shifting, which highlights the behavioural significance of
   alternatives.}},

Title = {{Attention, in and Out: Scalp-Level and Intracranial EEG Correlates of
   Interoception and Exteroception}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JUL 19}},
Abstract = {{Interoception, the monitoring of visceral signals, is often presumed to
   engage attentional mechanisms specifically devoted to inner bodily
   sensing. In fact, most standardized interoceptive tasks require
   directing attention to internal signals. However, most studies in the
   field have failed to compare attentional modulations between internally-
   and externally-driven processes, thus probing blind to the specificity
   of the former. Here we address this issue through a multidimensional
   approach combining behavioral measures, analyses of event-related
   potentials and functional connectivity via high-density
   electroencephalography, and intracranial recordings. In Study 1, 50
   healthy volunteers performed a heartbeat detection task as we recorded
   modulations of the heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) in three conditions:
   exteroception, basal interoception (also termed interoceptive accuracy),
   and post-feedback interoception (sometimes called interoceptive
   learning). In Study 2, to evaluate whether key interoceptive areas
   (posterior insula, inferior frontal gyrus, amygdala, and somatosensory
   cortex) were differentially modulated by externally- and
   internally-driven processes, we analyzed human intracranial recordings
   with depth electrodes in these regions. This unique technique provides a
   very fine grained spatio-temporal resolution compared to other
   techniques, such as EEG or fMRI. We found that both interoceptive
   conditions in Study 1 yielded greater HEP amplitudes than the
   exteroceptive one. In addition, connectivity analysis showed that
   post-feedback interoception, relative to basal interoception, involved
   enhanced long-distance connections linking frontal and posterior
   regions. Moreover, results from Study 2 showed a differentiation between
   oscillations during basal interoception (broadband: 35-110 Hz) and
   exteroception (1-35 Hz) in the insula, the amygdala, the somatosensory
   cortex, and the inferior frontal gyrus. In sum, this work provides
   convergent evidence for the specificity and dynamics of attentional
   mechanisms involved in interoception.}},

Title = {{Self-viewing is associated with negative affect rather than reward in
   highly narcissistic men: an fMRI study}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 19}},
Abstract = {{Subclinical narcissism is a personality trait with two faces: According
   to social-cognitive theories it is associated with grandiosity and
   feelings of superiority, whereas psychodynamic theories emphasize
   vulnerable aspects like fluctuating self-esteem and emotional conflicts.
   The psychodynamic view, however, is commonly not supported by
   self-report studies on subclinical narcissism. Personality neuroscience
   might help to better understand the phenomenon of narcissism beyond the
   limits of self-report research. While social-cognitive theory would
   predict that self-relevant processing should be accompanied by brain
   activity in reward-related areas in narcissistic individuals,
   psychodynamic theory would suggest that it should be accompanied by
   activation in regions pointing to negative affect or emotional conflict.
   In this study, extreme groups of high and low narcissistic individuals
   performed a visual self-recognition paradigm during fMRI. Viewing one's
   own face (as compared to faces of friends and strangers) was accompanied
   by greater activation of the dorsal and ventral anterior cingulate
   cortex (ACC) in highly narcissistic men. These results suggest that
   highly narcissistic men experience greater negative affect or emotional
   conflict during self-relevant processing and point to vulnerable aspects
   of subclinical narcissism that might not be apparent in self-report
   research.}},

   associated with socio-communicative impairments characteristic of autism
   spectrum disorders (ASD). Task-based fMRI was applied in 15 adults with
   ASD and 15 matched typicalcontrols (TC) to explore differences in
   activity and effective connectivity of STS while discriminating either
   `intact' versus `scrambled' biological motion point light displays
   (explicit processing) or responding to a color-change while the `intact'
   versus `scrambled' nature of the stimulus was irrelevant for the task
   (implicit processing). STS responded stronger to `intact' than
   `scrambled' stimuli in both groups, indicating that the basic encoding
   of `biological' versus `non-biological' motion seems to be intact in
   ASD. Only in the TC-group however, explicit attention to the biological
   motion content induced an augmentation of STS-activity, which was not
   observed in the ASD-group. Overall, these findings suggest an inadequacy
   to recruit STS upon task demand in ASD, rather than a generalized
   alteration in STS neural processing. The importance of attention
   orienting for recruiting relevant neural resources was further
   underlined by the observation that connectivity between STS and medial
   prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a key region in attention regulation,
   effectively modulated STS-recruitment in the ASD-group.}},

Abstract = {{One of the biggest problems in automated diagnosis of psychiatric
   disorders from medical images is the lack of sufficiently large samples
   for training. Sample size is especially important in the case of highly
   heterogeneous disorders such as schizophrenia, where machine learning
   models built on relatively low numbers of subjects may suffer from poor
   generalizability. Via multicenter studies and consortium initiatives
   researchers have tried to solve this problem by combining data sets from
   multiple sites. The necessary sharing of (raw) data is, however, often
   hindered by legal and ethical issues. Moreover, in the case of very
   large samples, the computational complexity might become too large. The
   solution to this problem could be distributed learning. In this paper we
   investigated the possibility to create a meta-model by combining support
   vector machines (SVM) classifiers trained on the local datasets, without
   the need for sharing medical images or any other personal data.
   Validation was done in a 4-center setup comprising of 480 first-episode
   schizophrenia patients and healthy controls in total. We built SVM
   models to separate patients from controls based on three different kinds
   of imaging features derived from structural MRI scans, and compared
   models built on the joint multicenter data to the meta-models. The
   results showed that the combined meta-model had high similarity to the
   model built on all data pooled together and comparable classification
   performance on all three imaging features. Both similarity and
   performance was superior to that of the local models. We conclude that
   combining models is thus a viable alternative that facilitates data
   sharing and creating bigger and more informative models.}},

Title = {{A novel GLM-based method for the Automatic IDentification of functional
   Events (AIDE) in fNIRS data recorded in naturalistic environments}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{155}},
Pages = {{291-304}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Recent technological advances have allowed the development of portable
   functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) devices that can be used
   to perform neuroimaging in the real-world. However, as real-world
   experiments are designed to mimic everyday life situations, the
   identification of event onsets can be extremely challenging and
   time-consuming. Here, we present a novel analysis method based on the
   general linear model (GLM) least square fit analysis for the Automatic
   IDentification of functional Events (or AIDE) directly from real-world
   fNIRS neuroimaging data. In order to investigate the accuracy and
   feasibility of this method, as a proof-of-principle we applied the
   algorithm to (i) synthetic fNIRS data simulating both block-,
   event-related and mixed-design experiments and (ii) experimental fNIRS
   data recorded during a conventional lab-based task (involving maths).
   AIDE was able to recover functional events from simulated fNIRS data
   with an accuracy of 89\%, 97\% and 91\% for the simulated block-,
   event-related and mixed-design experiments respectively. For the
   lab-based experiment, AIDE recovered more than the 66.7\% of the
   functional events from the fNIRS experimental measured data. To
   illustrate the strength of this method, we then applied AIDE to fNIRS
   data recorded by a wearable system on one participant during a complex
   real-world prospective memory experiment conducted outside the lab. As
   part of the experiment, there were four and six events (actions where
   participants had to interact with a target) for the two different
   conditions respectively (condition 1: social-interact with a person;
   condition 2: non-social-interact with an object). AIDE managed to
   recover 3/4 events and 3/6 events for conditions 1 and 2 respectively.
   The identified functional events were then corresponded to behavioural
   data from the video recordings of the movements and actions of the
   participant. Our results suggest that ``brain-first{''} rather than
   ``behaviour-first{''} analysis is possible and that the present method
   can provide a novel solution to analyse real-world fNIRS data, filling
   the gap between real-life testing and functional neuroimaging.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},

Volume = {{155}},

Abstract = {{Mentalizing is a fundamental process underpinning human social
   interaction. Claims of the existence of `implicit mentalizing' represent
   a fundamental shift in our understanding of this important skill,
   suggesting that preverbal infants and even animals may be capable of
   mentalizing. One of the most influential tasks supporting such claims in
   adults is the dot perspective-taking task, but demonstrations of similar
   performance on this task for mentalistic and non-mentalistic stimuli
   have led to the suggestion that this task in fact measures
   domain-general processes, rather than implicit mentalizing. A
   mentalizing explanation was supported by fMRI data claiming to show
   greater activation of brain areas involved in mentalizing, including
   right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ), when participants made
   self-perspective judgements in a mentalistic, but not in a
   non-mentalistic condition, an interpretation subsequently challenged.
   Here we provide the first causal test of the mentalizing claim using
   disruptive transcranial magnetic stimulation of rTPJ during
   self-perspective judgements. We found no evidence for a distinction
   between mentalistic and non-mentalistic stimuli: stimulation of rTPJ
   impaired performance on all self-perspective trials, regardless of the
   mentalistic/non-mentalistic nature of the stimulus. Our data support a
   domain-general attentional interpretation of performance on the dot
   perspective-taking task, a role which is subserved by the rTPJ.}},

Title = {{Neural correlates of altered feedback learning in women recovered from

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 14}},
Abstract = {{Anorexia nervosa (AN) is associated with exaggerated self-control and
   altered reward-based decision making, but the underlying neural
   mechanisms are poorly understood. Consistent with the notion of
   excessive cognitive control, we recently found increased dorsal anterior
   cingulate cortex (dACC) activation in acutely ill patients (acAN) on
   lose-shift trials in a probabilistic reversal learning (PRL) task.
   However, undernutrition may modulate brain function. In attempt to
   disentangle trait from state factors, the current fMRI study
   investigated cognitive control in recovered patients (recAN). Thirty-one
   recAN and 31 healthy controls (HC) completed a PRL task during fMRI.
   Based on previous findings, we focused on hemodynamic responses during
   lose-shift behaviour and conducted supplementary functional connectivity
   analysis. RecAN showed elevated lose-shift behaviour relative to HC. On
   the neural level, recAN showed normal dACC responses, but increased
   activation in fronto-parietal control regions. A trend for increased
   coupling between frontal and parietal regions of interest was also
   evident in recAN. The current findings in recAN differ from those in our
   previous study in acAN. While aberrant dACC response to negative
   feedback may be a correlate of the underweight state in acAN, impaired
   behavioural adaptation and elevated activation of cognitive control
   regions in recAN is suggestive of altered neural efficiency.}},

Title = {{Mechanism of Cerebralcare Granule (R) for Improving Cognitive Function
   in Resting-State Brain Functional Networks of Sub-healthy Subjects}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JUL 14}},
Abstract = {{Cerebralcare Granule (R) (CG), a Chinese herbal medicine, has been used
   to ameliorate cognitive impairment induced by ischemia or mental
   disorders. The ability of CG to improve health status and cognitive
   function has drawn researchers' attention, but the relevant brain
   circuits that underlie the ameliorative effects of CG remain unclear.
   The present study aimed to explore the underlying neurobiological
   mechanisms of CG in ameliorating cognitive function in sub-healthy
   subjects using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI). Thirty sub-healthy participants were instructed to take one
   2.5-g package of CG three times a day for 3 months. Clinical cognitive
   functions were assessed with the Chinese Revised Wechsler Adult
   Intelligence Scale (WAIS-RC) and Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS), and fMRI
   scans were performed at baseline and the end of intervention. Functional
   brain network data were analyzed by conventional network metrics (CNM)
   and frequent subgraph mining (FSM). Then 21 other sub-healthy
   participants were enrolled as a blank control group of cognitive
   functional. We found that administrating CG can improve the full scale
   of intelligence quotient (FIQ) and Memory Quotient (MQ) scores. At the
   same time, following CG treatment, in CG group, the topological
   properties of functional brain networks were altered in various frontal,
   temporal, occipital cortex regions, and several subcortical brain
   regions, including essential components of the executive attention
   network, the salience network, and the sensory-motor network. The nodes
   involved in the FSM results were largely consistent with the CNM
   findings, and the changes in nodal metrics correlated with improved
   cognitive function. These findings indicate that CG can improve
   sub-healthy subjects' cognitive function through altering brain
   functional networks. These results provide a foundation for future
   studies of the potential physiological mechanism of CG.}},

Title = {{Neural Response to Biological Motion in Healthy Adults Varies as a
   Function of Autistic-Like Traits}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JUL 14}},
Abstract = {{Perception of biological motion is an important social cognitive ability
   that has been mapped to specialized brain regions. Perceptual deficits
   and neural differences during biological motion perception have
   previously been associated with autism, a disorder classified by social
   and communication difficulties and repetitive and restricted interests
   and behaviors. However, the traits associated with autism are not
   limited to diagnostic categories, but are normally distributed within
   the general population and show the same patterns of heritability across
   the continuum. In the current study, we investigate whether
   self-reported autistic-like traits in healthy adults are associated with
   variable neural response during passive viewing of biological motion
   displays. Results show that more autistic-like traits, particularly
   those associated with the communication domain, are associated with
   increased neural response in key regions involved in social cognitive
   processes, including prefrontal and left temporal cortices. This
   distinct pattern of activation might reflect differential
   neurodevelopmental processes for individuals with varying autistic-like
   traits, and highlights the importance of considering the full trait
   continuum in future work.}},

Abstract = {{Research suggests that the discriminative and affective aspects of touch
   are processed differently in the brain. Primary somatosensory cortex is
   strongly implicated in touch discrimination, whereas insular and
   prefronal regions have been associated with pleasantness aspects of
   touch. However, the role of secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) is less
   clear. In the current study we used inhibitory repetitive transcranial
   magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to temporarily deactivate S2 and probe its
   role in touch perception. Nineteen healthy adults received two sessions
   of 1-Hz rTMS on separate days, one targeting right S2 and the other
   targeting the vertex (control). Before and after rTMS, subjects rated
   the intensity and pleasantness of slow and fast gentle brushing of the
   hand and performed a 2-point tactile discrimination task, followed by
   fMRI during additional brushing. rTMS to S2 (but not vertex) decreased
   intensity ratings of fast brushing, without altering touch pleasantness
   or spatial discrimination. MRI showed a reduced response to brushing in
   S2 (but not in S1 or insula) after S2 rTMS. Together, our results show
   that reducing touch evoked activity in S2 decreases perceived touch
   intensity, suggesting a causal role of S2 in touch intensity perception.

Title = {{The behavioral and neural basis of empathic blame}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 12}},
Abstract = {{Mature moral judgments rely both on a perpetrator's intent to cause
   harm, and also on the actual harm caused-even when unintended. Much
   prior research asks how intent information is represented neurally, but
   little asks how even unintended harms influence judgment. We interrogate
   the psychological and neural basis of this process, focusing especially
   on the role of empathy for the victim of a harmful act. Using fMRI, we
   found that the `empathy for pain' network was involved in encoding
   harmful outcomes and integrating harmfulness information for different
   types of moral judgments, and individual differences in the extent to
   which this network was active during encoding and integration of
   harmfulness information determined severity of moral judgments.
   Additionally, activity in the network was down-regulated for
   acceptability, but not blame, judgments for accidental harm condition,
   suggesting that these two types of moral evaluations are
   neurobiologically dissociable. These results support a model of
   ``empathic blame{''}, whereby the perceived suffering of a victim colors
   moral judgment of an accidental harmdoer.}},

Title = {{Spatiotemporal neural characterization of prediction error valence and
   surprise during reward learning in humans}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 6}},
Abstract = {{Reward learning depends on accurate reward associations with potential
   choices. These associations can be attained with reinforcement learning
   mechanisms using a reward prediction error (RPE) signal (the difference
   between actual and expected rewards) for updating future reward
   expectations. Despite an extensive body of literature on the influence
   of RPE on learning, little has been done to investigate the potentially
   separate contributions of RPE valence (positive or negative) and
   surprise (absolute degree of deviation from expectations). Here, we
   coupled single-trial electroencephalography with simultaneously acquired
   fMRI, during a probabilistic reversal-learning task, to offer evidence
   of temporally overlapping but largely distinct spatial representations
   of RPE valence and surprise. Electrophysiological variability in RPE
   valence correlated with activity in regions of the human reward network
   promoting approach or avoidance learning. Electrophysiological
   variability in RPE surprise correlated primarily with activity in
   regions of the human attentional network controlling the speed of
   learning. Crucially, despite the largely separate spatial extend of
   these representations our EEG-informed fMRI approach uniquely revealed a
   linear superposition of the two RPE components in a smaller network
   encompassing visuo-mnemonic and reward areas. Activity in this network
   was further predictive of stimulus value updating indicating a
   comparable contribution of both signals to reward learning.}},

Title = {{THE NEURAL CORRELATES OF THEORY OF MIND AND THEIR ROLE DURING EMPATHY

Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{355}},
Pages = {{149-160}},
Month = {{JUL 4}},
Abstract = {{Chess involves the capacity to reason iteratively about potential
   intentional choices of an opponent and therefore involves high levels of
   explicit theory of mind {[}ToM] (i.e. ability to infer mental states of
   others) alongside clear, strategic rule-based decision-making.
   Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used on 12 healthy male novice
   chess players to identify cortical regions associated with chess, ToM
   and empathizing. The blood-oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response
   for chess and empathizing tasks was extracted from each ToM region.
   Results showed neural overlap between ToM, chess and empathizing tasks
   in right-hemisphere temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) {[}BA40],
   left-hemisphere superior temporal gyrus {[}BA22] and posterior cingulate
   gyrus {[}BA23/31]. TPJ is suggested to underlie the capacity to reason
   iteratively about another's internal state in a range of tasks. Areas
   activated by ToM and empathy included right-hemisphere orbitofrontal
   cortex and bilateral middle temporal gyrus: areas that become active
   when there is need to inhibit one's own experience when considering the
   internal state of another and for visual evaluation of action
   rationality. Results support previous findings, that ToM recruits a
   neural network with each region sub-serving a supporting role depending
   on the nature of the task itself. In contrast, a network of cortical
   regions primarily located within right- and left-hemisphere
   medial-frontal and parietal cortex, outside the internal
   representational network, was selectively recruited during the chess
   task. We hypothesize that in our cohort of novice chess players the
   strategy was to employ an iterative thinking pattern which in part
   involved mentalizing processes and recruited core ToM-related regions.

Abstract = {{Accumulating data from fMRI studies implicate the rostral anterior
   cingulate cortex (rACC) in inhibition of attention to threat distractors
   that compete with task-relevant goals for processing resources. However,
   little data is available on the reliability of rACC activation. Our aim
   in the current study was to examine test-retest reliability of rACC
   activation over a 12-week period, in the context of a validated
   emotional interference paradigm that varied in perceptual load. During
   functional MRI, 23 healthy volunteers completed a task involving a
   target letter in a string of identical letters (low load) or in a string
   of mixed letters (high load) superimposed on angry, fearful, and neutral
   face distractors. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) indicated
   that under low, but not high perceptual load, rACC activation to fearful
   vs. neutral distractors was moderately reliable. Conversely, regardless
   of perceptual load, rACC activation to angry vs. neutral distractors was
   not reliable. Regarding behavioral performance, ICCs indicated that
   accuracy was not reliable regardless of distractor type or perceptual
   load. Although reaction time (AT) was similarly not reliable regardless
   of distractor type under low perceptual load, RT to angry vs. neutral
   distractors and to fearful vs. neutral distractors was reliable under
   high perceptual load. Together, results indicate the test-retest
   reliability of rACC activation and corresponding behavioral performance
   are context dependent; reliability of the former varies as a function of
   distractor type and level of cognitive demand, whereas reliability of
   the latter depends on behavioral index (accuracy vs. RT) and level of
   cognitive demand but not distractor type.}},

Abstract = {{Although the Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) is associated with
   threat-sensitivity, little is known about its neurofunctional correlates
   during cognitive control over task-irrelevant threat distractors. Thirty
   non-clinical participants, who ranged in BIS sensitivity, completed an
   attentional control paradigm during fMRI. The paradigm varied in
   cognitive demand with low perceptual load comprising identical target
   letters and high perceptual load comprising a target letter in a mixed
   letter string; each superimposed on threatening and neutral face
   distractors. Whole-brain results indicated that individuals with higher,
   relative to lower BIS sensitivity, exhibited enhanced dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex activation to angry (vs. neutral) and enhanced dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex activation to fearful (vs. neutral) face
   distractors under low load whereas no differences in activation were
   observed under high load. These findings are consistent with literature
   indicating that the BIS is involved in conflict processing, including
   between cognitive and emotional or motivational goals.}},

Title = {{Social value orientation modulates the FRN and P300 in the chicken game}},

Abstract = {{Social dilemmas pervade daily life, business, and politics. The manners
   in which these dilemmas are resolved depend in part on the personal
   characteristics of those involved. One such characteristic is Social
   Value Orientation (SVO), a trait-like predisposition to maximize
   cooperative (Pro-Social) or non-cooperative (Pro-Self) outcomes in
   social relationships. The present study investigated the role of SVO in
   modulating neural responses to outcomes in a type of social dilemma
   known as the Chicken Game. The Chicken Game models real-world situations
   involving two parties independently making a decision between
   cooperation and aggression. The EEG of Pro-Socials and Pro-Selfs was
   recorded while playing Chicken with a computer Opponent. Two ERP
   components were extracted: Feedback-Related Negativity (FRN) and the
   P300. Despite no behavioral differences in decision (i.e., cooperation,
   aggression), FRN results indicate that Pro-Socials experienced
   unreciprocated cooperation as the least desired outcome. Further, P300
   results show a main effect for the Opponent's choice, such that the
   Opponent's cooperation was more salient than aggression. Additionally,
   an interaction between the Participant's and Opponent's choice showed
   that the effect for the Opponent's choice only occurred when the
   Participant chose cooperation. None of the results for P300 were
   moderated by SVO. For both ERP components, Pro-Selfs showed no
   differential responding to Chicken outcomes. In addition, FRN magnitude
   on trial n predicted choice on trial n + 1 for Pro-Socials, but not for
   Pro-Selfs. P300 magnitude on trial n showed no relationship to choice on
   trial n+ 1. Results indicate that individual differences in SVO modulate
   FRN responses to Chicken outcomes, and that these neural reactions may
   have utility in predicting subsequent behaviors. For P300, there is no
   evidence of SVO modulation. Our general pattern of FRN responsiveness in
   Pro-Socials, but not in Pro-Selfs, is related to similar findings in
   fMRI and EEG research.}},

Title = {{Intranasal oxytocin, but not vasopressin, augments neural responses to
   toddlers in human fathers}},
Journal = {{HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{193-202}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates paternal brain function with the hope of better
   understanding the neural basis for variation in caregiving involvement
   among men. The neuropeptides oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) are
   implicated in paternal caregiving in humans and other species. In a
   double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject pharmaco-functional MRI
   experiment, we randomized 30 fathers of 1-2 year old children to receive
   either 24 IU intranasal OT before one scan and placebo before the other
   scan (n = 15) or 20 IU intranasal AVP before one scan and placebo before
   the other scan (n = 15). Brain function was measured with fMRI as the
   fathers viewed pictures of their children, unknown children and unknown
   adults, and as they listened to unknown infant cry stimuli. Intranasal
   OT, but not AVP, significantly increased the BOLD fMRI response to
   viewing pictures of own children within the caudate nucleus, a target of
   midbrain dopamine projections, as well as the dorsal anterior cingulate
   (dACC) and visual cortex, suggesting that intranasal oxytocin augments
   activation in brain regions involved in reward, empathy and attention in
   human fathers. OT effects also varied as a function of order of
   administration such that when OT was given before placebo, it increased
   activation within several reward-related structures (substantia nigra,
   ventral tegmental area, putamen) more than when it was given after
   placebo. Neither OT nor AVP had significant main effects on the neural
   response to cries. Our findings suggest that the hormonal changes
   associated with the transition to fatherhood are likely to facilitate
   increased approach motivation and empathy for children, and call for
   future research that evaluates the potential of OT to normalize deficits
   in paternal motivation, as might be found among men suffering from
   post-partum depression. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Single-trial EEG-informed fMRI analysis of emotional decision problems
   in hot executive function}},
Journal = {{BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background: Executive function refers to conscious control in
   psychological process which relates to thinking and action. Emotional
   decision is a part of hot executive function and contains emotion and
   logic elements. As a kind of important social adaptation ability, more
   and more attention has been paid in recent years.
   Objective: Gambling task can be well performed in the study of emotional
   decision. As fMRI researches focused on gambling task show not
   completely consistent brain activation regions, this study adopted
   EEG-fMRI fusion technology to reveal brain neural activity related with
   feedback stimuli.
   Methods: In this study, an EEG-informed fMRI analysis was applied to
   process simultaneous EEG-fMRI data. First, relative power-spectrum
   analysis and K-means clustering method were performed separately to
   extract EEG-fMRI features. Then, Generalized linear models were
   structured using fMRI data and using different EEG features as
   regressors.
   Results: The results showed that in the win versus loss stimuli, the
   activated regions almost covered the caudate, the ventral striatum (VS),
   the orbital frontal cortex (OFC), and the cingulate. Wide activation
   areas associated with reward and punishment were revealed by the
   EEG-fMRI integration analysis than the conventional fMRI results, such
   as the posterior cingulate and the OFC. The VS and the medial prefrontal
   cortex (mPFC) were found when EEG power features were performed as
   regressors of GLM compared with results entering the amplitudes of
   feedbacK-related negativity (FRN) as regressors. Furthermore, the brain
   region activation intensity was the strongest when theta-band power was
   used as a regressor compared with the other two fusion results.
   Conclusions: The EEG-based fMRI analysis can more accurately depict the
   whole-brain activation map and analyze emotional decision problems.}},
