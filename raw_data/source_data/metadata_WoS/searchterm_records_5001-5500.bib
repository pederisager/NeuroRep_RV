Abstract = {{Cognitive neuroscience has made considerable progress in understanding
   the involvement of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in social cognition and
   moral judgment. Accumulating evidence suggests that representations
   within the lateral PFC enable people to orchestrate their thoughts and
   actions in concert with their intentions to support goal-directed social
   behavior. Despite the pivotal role of this region in guiding social
   interactions, remarkably little is known about the functional
   organization and forms of social knowledge mediated by the lateral PFC.
   Here, we review recent theoretical developments in evolutionary
   psychology and emerging evidence from the social and decision
   neuroscience literatures demonstrating the importance of the lateral PFC
   for orchestrating behavior on the basis of evolutionarily adaptive
   social norms for obligatory, prohibited, and permissible courses of
   action. (C) 2010 John Wiley\& Sons, Ltd. WIREs Cogn Sci 2011 2 55-67

Title = {{Altered Effective Connectivity Network of the Amygdala in Social Anxiety
   Disorder: A Resting-State fMRI Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{The amygdala is often found to be abnormally recruited in social anxiety
   disorder (SAD) patients. The question whether amygdala activation is
   primarily abnormal and affects other brain systems or whether it
   responds ``normally{''} to an abnormal pattern of information conveyed
   by other brain structures remained unanswered. To address this question,
   we investigated a network of effective connectivity associated with the
   amygdala using Granger causality analysis on resting-state functional
   MRI data of 22 SAD patients and 21 healthy controls (HC). Implications
   of abnormal effective connectivity and clinical severity were
   investigated using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS). Decreased
   influence from inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) to amygdala was found in
   SAD, while bidirectional influences between amygdala and visual cortices
   were increased compared to HCs. Clinical relevance of decreased
   effective connectivity from ITG to amygdala was suggested by a negative
   correlation of LSAS avoidance scores and the value of Granger causality.
   Our study is the first to reveal a network of abnormal effective
   connectivity of core structures in SAD. This is in support of a
   disregulation in predescribed modules involved in affect control. The
   amygdala is placed in a central position of dysfunction characterized
   both by decreased regulatory influence of orbitofrontal cortex and
   increased crosstalk with visual cortex. The model which is proposed
   based on our results lends neurobiological support towards cognitive
   models considering disinhibition and an attentional bias towards
   negative stimuli as a core feature of the disorder.}},

Abstract = {{Individual variability in emotion processing may be associated with
   genetic variation as well as with psychological predispositions such as
   dispositional affect styles. Our previous fMRI study demonstrated that
   amygdala reactivity was independently predicted by affective-cognitive
   styles (phobic prone or eating disorders prone) and genotype of the
   serotonin transporter in a discrimination task of fearful facial
   expressions. Since the insula is associated with the subjective
   evaluation of bodily states and is involved in human feelings, we
   explored whether its activity could also vary in function of individual
   differences. In the present fMRI study, the association between
   dispositional affects and insula reactivity has been examined in two
   groups of healthy participants categorized according to
   affective-cognitive styles (phobic prone or eating disorders prone).
   Images of the faces of partners and strangers, in both painful and
   neutral situations, were used as visual stimuli. Interaction analyses
   indicate significantly different activations in the two groups in
   reaction to a loved one's pain: the phobic prone group exhibited greater
   activation in the left posterior insula. These results demonstrate that
   affective-cognitive style is associated with insula activity in pain
   empathy processing, suggesting a greater involvement of the insula in
   feelings for a certain cohort of people. In the mapping of individual
   differences, these results shed new light on variability in neural
   networks of emotion.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   enables investigation of the intrinsic functional organization of the
   brain. Fractal parameters such as the Hurst exponent, H, describe the
   complexity of endogenous low-frequency fMRI time series on a continuum
   from random (H = .5) to ordered (H = 1). Shifts in fractal scaling of
   physiological time series have been associated with neurological and
   cardiac conditions.
   Methods: Resting-state fMRI time series were recorded in 30 male adults
   with an autism spectrum condition (ASC) and 33 age-and IQ-matched male
   volunteers. The Hurst exponent was estimated in the wavelet domain and
   between-group differences were investigated at global and voxel level
   and in regions known to be involved in autism.
   Results: Complex fractal scaling of fMRI time series was found in both
   groups but globally there was a significant shift to randomness in the
   ASC (mean H = .758, SD = .045) compared with neurotypical volunteers
   (mean H = .788, SD = .047). Between-group differences in H, which was
   always reduced in the ASC group, were seen in most regions previously
   reported to be involved in autism, including cortical midline
   structures, medial temporal structures, lateral temporal and parietal
   structures, insula, amygdala, basal ganglia, thalamus, and inferior
   frontal gyrus. Severity of autistic symptoms was negatively correlated
   with H in retrosplenial and right anterior insular cortex.
   Conclusions: Autism is associated with a small but significant shift to
   randomness of endogenous brain oscillations. Complexity measures may
   provide physiological indicators for autism as they have done for other
   medical conditions.}},

Title = {{Hyperimitation of Actions Is Related to Reduced Understanding of Others'

Abstract = {{Background: Anecdotal evidence has noted that individuals with autism
   spectrum conditions (ASC) frequently exhibit heightened spontaneous
   imitative behavior, with symptoms of echolalia and echopraxia. This is
   contrasted by empiric reports that ASC results in decreased imitation
   and an underlying deficit in the mirror system, leading to impaired
   social understanding. Thus, it remains unclear whether automatic
   imitation is enhanced in ASC and how this is related to poorer social
   abilities.
   Methods: This study investigated spontaneous imitation in 18
   high-functioning adults with ASC and 18 age-and IQ-matched control
   participants during a simple imitation inhibition task. Mentalizing was
   experimentally assessed in the same participants using both behavioral
   and functional magnetic resonance imaging measures, as was social
   interaction using an observational measure.
   Results: Individuals with ASC showed increased imitation of hand actions
   compared with control participants and this was associated with reduced
   mentalizing and poorer reciprocal social interaction abilities. In the
   functional magnetic resonance imaging mentalizing paradigm, ASC
   participants with increased imitation scores showed less brain
   activation in areas often found to be active in mental state
   attribution, namely the medial prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal
   junction.
   Conclusions: The results confirm the presence of hyperimitation in ASC,
   which is accompanied by reduced social cognition, suggesting that a
   general imitation impairment and a global mirror system deficit are
   absent. These findings offer an explanation for echopractic features
   based on theories of atypical functioning of top-down modulation
   processes in autism.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},

Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: The processing mechanisms of visual working memory (VWM)
   have been extensively explored in the recent decade. However, how the
   perceptual information is extracted into VWM remains largely unclear.
   The current study investigated this issue by testing whether the
   perceptual information was extracted into VWM via an integrated-object
   manner so that all the irrelevant information would be extracted (object
   hypothesis), or via a feature-based manner so that only the
   target-relevant information would be extracted (feature hypothesis), or
   via an analogous processing manner as that in visual perception (analogy
   hypothesis).
   Methodology/Principal Findings: High-discriminable information which is
   processed at the parallel stage of visual perception and fine-grained
   information which is processed via focal attention were selected as the
   representatives of perceptual information. The analogy hypothesis
   predicted that whereas high-discriminable information is extracted into
   VWM automatically, fine-grained information will be extracted only if it
   is task-relevant. By manipulating the information type of the irrelevant
   dimension in a change-detection task, we found that the performance was
   affected and the ERP component N270 was enhanced if a change between the
   probe and the memorized stimulus consisted of irrelevant
   high-discriminable information, but not if it consisted of irrelevant
   fine-grained information.
   Conclusions/Significance: We conclude that dissociated extraction
   mechanisms exist in VWM for information resolved via dissociated
   processes in visual perception (at least for the information tested in
   the current study), supporting the analogy hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging of brain responses to biological
   motion in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), unaffected
   siblings (US) of children with ASD, and typically developing (TD)
   children has revealed three types of neural signatures: (i) state
   activity, related to the state of having ASD that characterizes the
   nature of disruption in brain circuitry; (ii) trait activity, reflecting
   shared areas of dysfunction in US and children with ASD, thereby
   providing a promising neuroendophenotype to facilitate efforts to bridge
   genomic complexity and disorder heterogeneity; and (iii) compensatory
   activity, unique to US, suggesting a neural system-level mechanism by
   which US might compensate for an increased genetic risk for developing
   ASD. The distinct brain responses to biological motion exhibited by TD
   children and US are striking given the identical behavioral profile of
   these two groups. These findings offer far-reaching implications for our
   understanding of the neural systems underlying autism.}},

Abstract = {{Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) the present study
   examined the neural mechanisms involved in recognizing spatial
   configurations of a scene from multiple viewpoints Prior to scanning,
   participants were instructed to learn a desktop array of seven objects
   relative to an intrinsic direction that was different from the
   participants' viewpoint During scanning, participants recognized
   triplets of objects from the previously memorized scene and from a
   mirror reflection of the scene at different perspectives Half of the
   triplets included two objects located along the instructed Intrinsic
   direction (intrinsic triplets) and the other half did not (non intrinsic
   triplets) Consistent with previous mental rotation studies bilateral
   intraparietal sulcus and bilateral middle frontal gyrus showed
   increasing activation with the angular disparity between the test view
   and the study view The right intraparietal sulcus was more activated to
   the non intrinsic triplets than the intrinsic triplets The anterior
   cingulate cortex was more deactivated in recognizing non intrinsic
   triplets and novel views These findings are consistent with the
   behavioral results that recognition was easier for intrinsic triplets
   than for non intrinsic triplets and easier for the familiar view than
   for novel views (Mou et al, 2008a) (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights

Abstract = {{Objective: Little is known about the neural underpinnings of generalized
   social phobia, which is defined by a persistent heightened fear of
   social disapproval. Using event-related functional MRI (fMRI), the
   authors examined whether the intent of an event, which mediates the
   neural response to social disapproval in healthy individuals,
   differentially affects response in generalized social phobia.
   Method: Sixteen patients with generalized social phobia and 16 healthy
   comparison subjects group-matched on age, gender, and IQ underwent fMRI
   scans while reading stories that involved neutral social events,
   unintentional social transgressions (e.g., choking on food at a party
   and coughing it up), or intentional social transgressions (e.g.,
   disliking food at a party and spitting it out).
   Results: Significant group-by-transgression interactions were observed
   in ventral regions of the medial prefrontal cortex. Healthy individuals
   tended to show increased blood-oxygen-level-dependent responses to
   intentional relative to unintentional transgressions. Patients with
   generalized social phobia, however, showed significantly increased
   responses to the unintentional transgressions. They also rated the
   unintentional transgressions as significantly more embarrassing than did
   the comparison subjects. Results also revealed significant group main
   effects in the amygdala and insula bilaterally, reflecting elevated
   generalized social phobia responses in these regions to all event types.
   Conclusions: These results further implicate the medial prefrontal
   cortex in the pathophysiology of generalized social phobia, specifically
   through its involvement in distorted self-referential processing. These
   results also further underscore the extended role of the amygdala and
   insula in the processing of social stimuli more generally in generalized
   social phobia.}},

Abstract = {{Self-esteem is a facet of personality that influences perception of
   social standing and modulates the salience of social acceptance and
   rejection. As such, self-esteem may bias neural responses to positive
   and negative social feedback across individuals. During functional
   magnetic resonance imaging scanning, participants (n = 42) engaged in a
   social evaluation task whereby they ostensibly received feedback from
   peers indicating they were liked or disliked. Results demonstrated that
   individuals with low self-esteem believed that they received less
   positive feedback from others and showed enhanced activity to positive
   versus negative social feedback in the ventral anterior cingulate
   cortex/medial prefrontal cortex (vACC/mPFC). By contrast, vACC/mPFC
   activity was insensitive to positive versus negative feedback in
   individuals with high self-esteem, and these individuals consistently
   overestimated the amount of positive feedback received from peers.
   Voxelwise analyses supported these findings; lower self-esteem predicted
   a linear increase in vACC/mPFC response to positive versus negative
   social feedback. Taken together, the present findings propose a
   functional role for the vACC/mPFC in representing the salience of social
   feedback and shaping perceptions of relative social standing.}},

Title = {{Disorder-Specific Inferior Prefrontal Hypofunction in Boys with Pure
   Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Compared to Boys with Pure
   Conduct Disorder During Cognitive Flexibility}},
Journal = {{HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{31}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background. Problems with cognitive flexibility have been observed in
   patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and in
   patients with conduct disorder (CD), characterized by the violation of
   societal rules and the rights of others. Functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) of cognitive switching, however, has only been
   investigated in patients with ADHD, including comorbidity with CD,
   finding frontostriatal and temporoparietal underactivation. This study
   investigates disorder-specific functional abnormalities during cognitive
   flexibility between medication-naive children and adolescents with
   noncomorbid CD and those with noncomorbid ADHD compared to healthy
   controls. Methods. Event-related fMRI was used to compare brain
   activation of 14 boys with noncomorbid, childhood-onset CD, 14 boys with
   noncomorbid ADHD, and 20 healthy comparison boys during a visual-spatial
   Switch task. Results. Behaviorally, children with ADHD compared to
   children with CD had significantly slower reaction times to switch
   compared to repeat trials. The fMRI comparison showed that the patients
   with ADHD compared to both controls and patients with CD showed
   underactivation in right and left inferior prefrontal cortex. No
   disorder-specific brain underactivation was observed in patients with
   CD. Only when compared with controls alone, the disruptive behavior
   group showed reduced activation in bilateral temporoparietal and
   occipital brain regions. Conclusions. The findings extend previous
   evidence for disorder-specific underactivation in patients with ADHD
   compared to patients with CD in inferior prefrontal cortex during tasks
   of inhibitory control to the domain of cognitive flexibility. Inferior
   prefrontal underactivation thus appears to be a disorder-specific
   neurofunctional biomarker for ADHD when compared with patients with CD.

Abstract = {{The ability and motivation to share attention is a unique aspect of
   human cognition. Despite its significance, the neural basis remains
   elusive. To investigate the neural correlates of joint attention, we
   developed a novel, interactive research paradigm in which participants'
   gaze behavior-as measured by an eye tracking device-was used to
   contingently control the gaze of a computer-animated character.
   Instructed that the character on screen was controlled by a real person
   outside the scanner, 21 participants interacted with the virtual other
   while undergoing fMRI. Experimental variations focused on leading versus
   following the gaze of the character when fixating one of three objects
   also shown on the screen. In concordance with our hypotheses, results
   demonstrate, firstly, that following someone else's gaze to engage in
   joint attention resulted in activation of anterior portion of medial
   prefrontal cortex (MPFC) known to be involved in the supramodal
   coordination of perceptual and cognitive processes. Secondly, directing
   someone else's gaze toward an object activated the ventral striatum
   which-in light of ratings obtained from participants-appears to underlie
   the hedonic aspects of sharing attention. The data, therefore, support
   the idea that other-initiated joint attention relies upon recruitment of
   MPFC previously related to the ``meeting of minds.{''} In contrast,
   self-initiated joint attention leads to a differential increase of
   neural activity in reward-related brain areas, which might contribute to
   the uniquely human motivation to engage in the sharing of experiences.}},

Abstract = {{The diverse nature of cerebral activity, as measured using neuroimaging
   techniques, has been recognised long ago. It seems obvious that using
   single modality recordings can be limited when it comes to capturing its
   complex nature. Thus, it has been argued that moving to a multimodal
   approach will allow neuroscientists to better understand the dynamics
   and structure of this activity. This means that integrating information
   from different techniques, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and the
   blood oxygenated level dependent (BOLD) signal recorded with functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), represents an important
   methodological challenge. In this work, we review the work that has been
   done thus far to derive EEG/fMRI integration approaches. This leads us
   to inspect the conditions under which such an integration approach could
   work or fail, and to disclose the types of scientific questions one
   could (and could not) hope to answer with it.}},

Abstract = {{A fundamental function of the brain is to evaluate the emotional and
   motivational significance of stimuli and to adapt behaviour accordingly.
   The IMAGEN study is the first multicentre genetic-neuroimaging study
   aimed at identifying the genetic and neurobiological basis of individual
   variability in impulsivity, reinforcer sensitivity and emotional
   reactivity, and determining their predictive value for the development
   of frequent psychiatric disorders. Comprehensive behavioural and
   neuropsychological characterization, functional and structural
   neuroimaging and genome-wide association analyses of 2000 14-year-old
   adolescents are combined with functional genetics in animal and human
   models. Results will be validated in 1000 adolescents from the Canadian
   Saguenay Youth Study. The sample will be followed up longitudinally at
   the age of 16 years to investigate the predictive value of genetics and
   intermediate phenotypes for the development of frequent psychiatric
   disorders. This review describes the strategies the IMAGEN consortium
   used to meet the challenges posed by large-scale multicentre
   imaging-genomics investigations. We provide detailed methods and
   Standard Operating Procedures that we hope will be helpful for the
   design of future studies. These include standardization of the clinical,
   psychometric and neuroimaging-acquisition protocols, development of a
   central database for efficient analyses of large multimodal data sets

Title = {{It is not always tickling: Distinct cerebral responses during perception

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1264-1271}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Laughter is highly relevant for social interaction in human beings and
   non-human primates. In humans as well as in non-human primates laughter
   can be induced by tickling. Human laughter, however, has further
   diversified and encompasses emotional laughter types with various
   communicative functions, e.g. joyful and taunting laughter. Here, it was
   evaluated if this evolutionary diversification of ecological functions
   is associated with distinct cerebral responses underlying laughter
   perception. Functional MRI revealed a double-dissociation of cerebral
   responses during perception of tickling laughter and emotional laughter
   (joy and taunt) with higher activations in the anterior rostral medial
   frontal cortex (arMFC) when emotional laughter was perceived, and
   stronger responses in the right superior temporal gyms (STG) during
   appreciation of tickling laughter. Enhanced activation of the arMFC for
   emotional laughter presumably reflects increasing demands on social
   cognition processes arising from the greater social salience of these
   laughter types. Activation increase in the STG for tickling laughter may
   be linked to the higher acoustic complexity of this laughter type. The
   observed dissociation of cerebral responses for emotional laughter and
   tickling laughter was independent of task-directed focusing of
   attention. These findings support the postulated diversification of
   human laughter in the course of evolution from an unequivocal play
   signal to laughter with distinct emotional contents subserving complex
   social functions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The primary question asked for this special issue concerns how
   neuroscience data might contribute to and generate new theories in
   social psychology. Interestingly, in attempts to address this question,
   social neuroscientists have rushed to make sometimes overly bold claims
   about their data to demonstrate the utility of social neuroscience. The
   implicit logic in this response is a fear that to be useful, social
   neuroscience data needs quickly to move beyond brain mapping-the
   localization of specific social processes such as morality, the self,
   attitude, or prejudice to a particular brain region-and contribute in a
   more meaningful way. The promise of social neuroscience has always been
   to link multiple levels of analysis, constrain interpretation across
   these levels, and derive new predictions; yet there is now some question
   as to whether the field can deliver on this promise. Although this is an
   important question to ask, I suggest that requiring specific answers to
   this concern may be counterproductive at this stage of the field and
   that shifting the focus from brain mapping to process inference may be
   too early. Reverse inferences from the brain to social theory need to be
   based on accurate models of brain function and to the extent there are
   errors in our understanding of observed brain activation patterns our
   inferences will be necessarily invalid. What is required in social
   neuroscience research is an iterative cycle of brain mapping with one
   goal to understand how social and affective processes are computed in
   the brain, and with each iteration a second goal to determine whether
   (a) current social psychological models can account for these data, and
   (b) if not, to derive new theories. Thus, brain mapping as a research
   goal cannot be maligned, as it is a critical element of the social
   neuroscience enterprise. Indeed, at this stage of this newly emerging
   field, brain mapping should perhaps even be our dominant focus.}},

Abstract = {{As part of a general trend toward interdisciplinary approaches, the
   social cognitive neurosciences was founded on the premise that research
   into social issues that take the brain seriously have much to contribute

   come to dominate the emerging field. In this paper we argue that (a) an

   insight into the nature of human social behavior, and (b) within the
   domain of neuroscience, no one method-be it brain scanning, patient

Abstract = {{In this study, we compared the effects of using neutral face masks vs
   non-face pattern masks on amygdala activity to masked fearful faces.
   Twenty-seven subjects viewed 18 s blocks of either fearful or happy
   faces masked with either neutral faces or patterns, while their brain
   activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   Results replicated increased amygdala activation to face-masked fearful
   vs happy faces. In the pattern mask condition, the amygdala
   discriminated between masked fearful and happy faces, but this effect
   manifested as a decrease in activation to fearful faces compared to
   happy faces. This interactive effect between facial expression and mask
   stimulus shows that amygdala responses to masked fearful faces are
   influenced by the fearful stimuli per se as well as their interaction
   with the mask stimulus.}},

Abstract = {{The regulation of negative emotion through reappraisal has been shown to
   induce increased prefrontal activity and decreased amygdala activity.
   Individual differences in dispositional mindfulness reflect differences
   in typical recognition, detachment and regulation of current experience,
   thought to also operate as top-down control mechanism. We sought to
   investigate whether such individual differences would be associated with
   brain activity elicited during reappraisal of negative emotion. Eighteen
   healthy participants completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging
   task that involved attending to or reappraising negative stimuli, and
   provided emotion experience ratings after each trial. Dispositional
   mindfulness was assessed with a self-report questionnaire. Reappraisal
   induced activity in a brain network involving predominantly dorsal
   portions of the prefrontal cortex, replicating previous studies. A
   voxelwise regression analysis showed that individual differences in the
   tendency to be mindful predicted activity in neural regions underlying
   reappraisal, with dorsomedial prefrontal cortex activation increasing
   with more mindfulness traits. Notably, this prefrontal activation was
   inversely correlated with the amygdala response to negative scenes,
   further supporting its role in down-regulating emotion-generation
   regions. These findings suggest that individual differences in
   dispositional mindfulness, which reflect the tendency to recognize and
   regulate current states, may modulate activity in neural systems
   involved in the effective cognitive control of negative emotion.}},

Abstract = {{Moral judgment is an evaluation of the actions and character of a person
   made with respect to societal norms. Although many types of vignettes
   have been used in previous studies on moral beliefs and judgment, what
   is missing is a set of standardized common vignettes based in real life.
   The goal of this study was to provide researchers with stimuli that have
   values on several dimensions pertaining to moral judgment and whose
   underlying components are known. These values will allow researchers to
   select stimuli based on standardized ratings rather than on the results
   of pilot studies, while avoiding the limitations of the classic,
   abstract moral scenarios. Our study was composed of three phases, (i)
   collecting and shortening the vignettes, (ii) obtaining ratings of the
   vignettes on several dimensions including emotional intensity, degree of
   social norm violation, and level of harm or benefit caused and (iii)
   determining the underlying components of the vignettes by performing a
   factor analysis. We found three components that accounted for most of
   the variance: norm violation, social affect and intention. The resulting
   vignettes can be used in future parametric studies on moral judgment in
   behavioral, neuropsychological and functional imaging experiments.}},

Abstract = {{According to sociometer theory, self-esteem serves as a barometer of the
   extent to which individuals are socially included or excluded by others.
   We hypothesized that trait self-esteem would be related to social pain
   responsiveness, and we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to
   experimentally investigate this potential relationship. Participants (n
   = 26) performed a cyberball task, a computerized game of catch during
   which the participants were excluded from the game. Participants then
   rated the degree of social pain experienced during both inclusion in and
   exclusion from the game. Individuals with lower trait self-esteem
   reported increased social pain relative to individuals with higher trait
   self-esteem, and such individuals also demonstrated a greater degree of
   dorsal anterior cingulate cortex activation. A psychophysiological
   interaction analysis revealed a positive connectivity between the dorsal
   anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortices for the lower trait
   self-esteem group, and a corresponding negative connectivity for the
   higher trait self-esteem group. Heightened dorsal anterior cortex
   activity and a corresponding connection with the prefrontal cortex might
   be one possible explanation for the greater levels of social pain
   observed experienced by individuals with low trait self-esteem.}},

Abstract = {{Mentalization is the process by which an observer views a target as
   possessing higher cognitive faculties such as goals, intentions and
   desires. Mentalization can be assessed using action identification
   paradigms, in which observers choose mentalistic (goals-focused) or
   mechanistic (action-focused) descriptions of targets' actions. Neural
   structures that play key roles in inferring goals and intentions from
   others' observed or imagined actions include temporo-parietal junction,
   ventral premotor cortex and extrastriate body area. We hypothesized that
   these regions play a role in action identification as well. Data
   collected using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) confirmed
   our predictions that activity in ventral premotor cortex and middle
   temporal gyrus near the extrastriate body area varies both as a function
   of the valence of the target and the extent to which actions are
   identified as goal-directed. In addition, the inferior parietal lobule
   is preferentially engaged when participants identify the actions of
   mentalized targets. Functional connectivity analyses suggest support
   from other regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala,
   during mentalization. We found correlations between action
   identification and Autism Quotient scores, suggesting that understanding
   the neural correlates of action identification may enhance our
   understanding of the underpinnings of essential social cognitive
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{Using moral dilemmas, we (i) investigate whether stereotypes motivate
   people to value ingroup lives over outgroup lives and (ii) examine the
   neurobiological correlates of relative social valuation using fMRI.
   Saving ingroup members, who seem warm and competent (e.g. Americans),
   was most morally acceptable in the context of a dilemma where one person
   was killed to save five people. Extreme outgroup members, who seem
   neither warm nor competent (e.g. homeless), were the worst off; it was
   most morally acceptable to sacrifice them and least acceptable to save
   them. Sacrificing these low-warmth, low-competence targets to save
   ingroup targets, specifically, activated a neural network associated
   with resolving complex tradeoffs: medial PFC (BA 9, extending caudally
   to include ACC), left lateral OFC (BA 47) and left dorsolateral PFC (BA
   10). These brain regions were recruited for dilemmas that participants
   ultimately rated as relatively more acceptable. We propose that
   participants, though ambivalent, overrode general aversion to these
   tradeoffs when the cost of sacrificing a low-warmth, low-competence
   target was pitted against the benefit of saving ingroup targets. Moral
   decisions are not made in a vacuum; intergroup biases and stereotypes
   weigh heavily on neural systems implicated in moral decision making.}},

Abstract = {{Perception of both gaze-direction and symbolic directional cues (e.g.
   arrows) orient an observer's attention toward the indicated location. It
   is unclear, however, whether these similar behavioral effects are
   examples of the same attentional phenomenon and, therefore, subserved by
   the same neural substrate. It has been proposed that gaze, given its
   evolutionary significance, constitutes a `special' category of spatial
   cue. As such, it is predicted that the neural systems supporting spatial
   reorienting will be different for gaze than for non-biological symbols.
   We tested this prediction using functional magnetic resonance imaging to
   measure the brain's response during target localization in which
   laterally presented targets were preceded by uninformative gaze or arrow
   cues. Reaction times were faster during valid than invalid trials for
   both arrow and gaze cues. However, differential patterns of activity
   were evoked in the brain. Trials including invalid rather than valid
   arrow cues resulted in a stronger hemodynamic response in the ventral
   attention network. No such difference was seen during trials including
   valid and invalid gaze cues. This differential engagement of the ventral
   reorienting network is consistent with the notion that the facilitation
   of target detection by gaze cues and arrow cues is subserved by
   different neural substrates.}},

Title = {{The Impact of Anxiety-Inducing Distraction on Cognitive Performance: A
   Combined Brain Imaging and Personality Investigation}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Previous investigations revealed that the impact of
   task-irrelevant emotional distraction on ongoing goal-oriented cognitive
   processing is linked to opposite patterns of activation in emotional and
   perceptual vs. cognitive control/executive brain regions. However,
   little is known about the role of individual variations in these
   responses. The present study investigated the effect of trait anxiety on
   the neural responses mediating the impact of transient anxiety-inducing
   task-irrelevant distraction on cognitive performance, and on the neural
   correlates of coping with such distraction. We investigated whether
   activity in the brain regions sensitive to emotional distraction would
   show dissociable patterns of co-variation with measures indexing
   individual variations in trait anxiety and cognitive performance.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Event-related fMRI data, recorded while
   healthy female participants performed a delayed-response working memory
   (WM) task with distraction, were investigated in conjunction with
   behavioural measures that assessed individual variations in both trait
   anxiety and WM performance. Consistent with increased sensitivity to
   emotional cues in high anxiety, specific perceptual areas (fusiform
   gyrus - FG) exhibited increased activity that was positively correlated
   with trait anxiety and negatively correlated with WM performance,
   whereas specific executive regions (right lateral prefrontal cortex -
   PFC) exhibited decreased activity that was negatively correlated with
   trait anxiety. The study also identified a role of the medial and left
   lateral PFC in coping with distraction, as opposed to reflecting a
   detrimental impact of emotional distraction.
   Conclusions: These findings provide initial evidence concerning the
   neural mechanisms sensitive to individual variations in trait anxiety
   and WM performance, which dissociate the detrimental impact of emotion
   distraction and the engagement of mechanisms to cope with distracting
   emotions. Our study sheds light on the neural correlates of
   emotion-cognition interactions in normal behaviour, which has
   implications for understanding factors that may influence susceptibility
   to affective disorders, in general, and to anxiety disorders, in
   particular.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{943-951}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Individuals carrying the short allele of a common polymorphism in the
   promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) exhibit
   heightened amygdala responses to passive stimulation with aversive
   emotional material. In turn, the level of amygdala activation in
   response to emotion can be decreased by will, for example by using
   cognitive emotion regulation strategies. In the present study, 37 female
   subjects (s-carriers: n=21; 1/1-homozygotes: n=16) performed an emotion
   regulation task during functional magnetic resonance imaging to
   determine whether cognitive emotion regulation can modulate the
   genetically determined amygdala hyperreactivity in 5-HTTLPR short allele
   carriers. Our results demonstrate that cognitive emotion regulation
   diminishes the difference in amygdala reactivity to threat-related
   stimuli between 5-HTTLPR genotype groups. Furthermore, we also provide
   evidence that the effect of cognitive regulation is mediated through
   altered coupling between the amygdala and prefrontal regulatory regions.
   Our findings demonstrate that while the presence of the 5-HTTLPR short
   allele leads to heightened responses in the amygdala, cognitive
   regulation can modify genetically mediated effects upon brain function
   by volitionally altering prefrontal-amygdala connectivity. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Combining transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with concurrent
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allows study of how local
   brain stimulation may causally affect activity in remote brain regions.
   Here, we applied bursts of high- or low-intensity TMS over right
   posterior parietal cortex, during a task requiring sustained covert
   visuospatial attention to either the left or right hemifield, or in a
   neutral control condition, while recording blood
   oxygenation-level-dependent signal with a posterior MR surface coil. As
   expected, the active attention conditions activated components of the
   well-described ``attention network,{''} as compared with the neutral
   baseline. Also as expected, when comparing left minus right attention,
   or vice versa, contralateral occipital visual cortex was activated. The
   critical new finding was that the impact of high- minus low-intensity
   parietal TMS upon these visual regions depended on the currently
   attended side. High- minus low-intensity parietal TMS increased the
   difference between contralateral versus ipsilateral attention in right
   extrastriate visual cortex. A related albeit less pronounced pattern was
   found for left extrastriate visual cortex. Our results confirm that
   right human parietal cortex can exert attention-dependent influences on
   occipital visual cortex and provide a proof of concept for the use of
   concurrent TMS-fMRI in studying how remote influences can vary in a
   purely top-down manner with attentional demands.}},

Abstract = {{Social learning is essential for adaptive behavior in humans.
   Neurofeedback based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   trains control over localized brain activity. It can disentangle
   learning processes at the neural level and thus investigate the
   mechanisms of operant conditioning with explicit social reinforcers. In
   a pilot study, a computer-generated face provided a positive feedback
   (smiling) when activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) increased
   and gradually returned to a neutral expression when the activity
   dropped. One female volunteer without previous experience in fMRI
   underwent training based on a social reinforcer. Directly before and
   after the neurofeedback runs, neural responses to a cognitive
   interference task (Simon task) were recorded. We observed a significant
   increase in activity within ACC during the neurofeedback blocks,
   correspondent with the a-priori defined anatomical region of interest.
   In the course of the neurofeedback training, the subject learned to
   regulate ACC activity and could maintain the control even without direct
   feedback. Moreover, ACC was activated significantly stronger during
   Simon task after the neurofeedback training when compared to before.
   Localized brain activity can be controlled by social reward. The
   increased ACC activity transferred to a cognitive task with the
   potential to reduce cognitive interference. Systematic studies are
   required to explore long-term effects on social behavior and clinical
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{This article discusses the application of sensitivity analysis (SA) in
   biomedical models. Sensitivity analysis is widely applied in physics,
   chemistry, economics, social sciences and other areas where models are
   developed. By assigning a prior probability distribution to each model
   variable, the SA framework appeals to the posterior probabilities of the
   model to evaluate the relative importance of these variables on the
   output distribution based on the principle of general variance
   decomposition. Within this framework, the SA paradigm serves as an
   objective platform to quantify the contributions of each model factor
   relative to their empirical range. We present statistical derivations of
   variance-based SA in this context and discuss its detailed properties
   through some practical examples. Our emphasis is on the application of
   SA in the biomedical field. As we show, it may provide a useful tool for
   model quality assessment, model reduction and factor prioritization, and
   improve our understanding of the model structure and underlying
   mechanisms. When usual approaches for calculating sensitivity index
   involve the employment of Monte Carlo analysis, which is computationally
   expensive in the large-sampling paradigm, we develop two effective
   numerical approximate methods for quick SA evaluations based on the
   unscented transformation (UT) that utilize a deterministic sampling
   approach in place of random sampling to calculate posterior statistics.
   We show that these methods achieve an excellent compromise between
   computational burden and calculation precision. In addition, a clear
   guideline is absent to evaluate the importance of variable for model
   reduction, we also present an objective statistical criterion to
   quantitatively decide whether or not a descriptive parameter is nominal
   and may be discarded in ensuing model-based analysis without significant
   loss of information on model behavior.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we provide theoretical and numerical analysis of a
   geometric activity flow network model which is aimed at explaining
   mathematically the scale-free functional graph self-organization
   phenomena emerging in complex nervous systems at a mesoscale level. In
   our model, each unit corresponds to a large number of neurons and may be
   roughly seen as abstracting the functional behavior exhibited by a
   single voxel under functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In the
   course of the dynamics, the units exchange portions of formal charge,
   which correspond to waves of activity in the underlying microscale
   neuronal circuit. The geometric model abstracts away the neuronal
   complexity and is mathematically tractable, which allows us to establish
   explicit results on its ground states and the resulting charge transfer
   graph modeling functional graph of the network. We show that, for a wide
   choice of parameters and geometrical setups, our model yields a
   scale-free functional connectivity with the exponent approaching 2,
   which is in agreement with previous empirical studies based on fMRI. The
   level of universality of the presented theory allows us to claim that
   the model does shed light on mesoscale functional self-organization
   phenomena of the nervous system, even without resorting to closer
   details of brain connectivity geometry which often remain unknown. The
   material presented here significantly extends our previous work where a
   simplified mean-field model in a similar spirit was constructed,
   ignoring the underlying network geometry.}},

Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{390-398}},

Abstract = {{Background: Abnormal neural responses to others' emotions, particularly
   cues of threat and distress, have been implicated in the development of
   chronic violence. We examined neural responses to several emotional cues
   within a prospectively identified group of chronically violent men. We
   also explored the association between neural responses to social
   emotions and psychopathic features. Methods: We compared neural
   responses to happy, sad, angry, fearful and neutral faces between
   chronically violent (n = 22) and non violent (n = 20) men using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants were
   prospectively identified from a longitudinal study based on information
   collected from age 7 to 27 years. We assessed psychopathic features
   using a self-report measure administered in adulthood. Results: The
   chronically violent men exhibited significantly reduced neural responses
   in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex to all faces, regardless of the
   emotional content, compared with nonviolent men. We also observed a
   hyperactive amygdala response to neutral faces in chronically violent
   men, but only within the context of viewing happy faces. Moreover, they
   exhibited a greater dorsomedial prefrontal cortex response to mildly
   fearful faces than nonviolent men. These abnormalities were not
   associated with psychopathic features in chronically violent men.
   Limitations: It remains unclear whether the observed neural
   abnormalities preceded or are a consequence of persistent violence, and
   these results may not generalize to chronically violent women.
   Conclusion: Chronically violent men exhibit a reduced neural response to
   facial cues regardless of emotional content. It appears that chronically
   violent men may view emotionally ambiguous facial cues as potentially
   threatening and implicitly reinterpret subtle cues of fear in others so
   they no longer elicit a negative response.}},

Abstract = {{Theory of mind (TOM) refers to the capacity to infer one's own and other
   persons' mental states. ToM abilities are compromised in schizophrenia,
   in association with dysfunctional activity in predominantly prefrontal
   brain regions. Prior behavioral studies have also suggested ToM deficits
   in healthy individuals with psychosis proneness (PP), although no study
   to date had investigated the associated neural mechanisms in such a
   sample. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
   compare brain activation of subjects with high versus low scores on
   positive-dimension PP and a ToM task. The ToM task involved first and
   second order attribution of cognitive and affective mental states to a
   cartoon character based on verbal and eye-gaze cues. No between-group
   differences were found on behavioral performance. fMRI analyses revealed
   a group interaction in anterior prefrontal cortex (BA 10), with the high
   PP group showing significantly more activity thereof, relative to the
   low PP, during second order mentalizing than during first order
   mentalizing. Further between-group differences were observed in
   dorsomedial and lateral prefrontal regions (BA 46/9), with the high PP
   group also showing greater activation during second order mentalizing.
   These results suggest that subjects with positive-dimension PP require
   more activation of prefrontal areas to adequately mentalize. Differences
   in the neural mechanisms underlying ToM might be associated with
   vulnerability to psychosis. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are associated with abnormalities in
   face memory, which evidence suggests has a protracted development
   through adolescence. The development of face memory in people with and
   without ASD, from 9 to 29 years old, was examined using the Cambridge
   Face Memory Test (CFMT). Results indicate that the developmental
   improvement evident from adolescence to adulthood typically was not
   apparent in individuals with ASD. While children and adolescents with
   ASD performed similarly to typically developing individuals comparable
   in age and IQ, adults with ASD displayed limitations on the CFMT. The
   pattern of performance was constant across conditions despite
   differences in the timing of the presentation and delay. This atypical
   development in ASD is consistent with the view that the processing of
   complex visual stimuli continues to develop through adolescence, along
   with the function and structure of the temporal lobes, but that this
   process is disrupted in ASD. This result underscores the importance of
   characterizing adolescent development for understanding ASD, and
   suggests additional opportunities for intervention. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Patients with generalized social anxiety disorder (GSAD) exhibit
   heightened activation of the amygdala in response to social cues
   conveying threat (eg, fearful/angry faces). The neuropeptide oxytocin
   (OXT) decreases anxiety and stress, facilitates social encounters, and
   attenuates amygdala reactivity to threatening faces in healthy subjects.
   The goal of this study was to examine the effects of OXT on fear-related
   amygdala reactivity in GSAD and matched healthy control (CON) subjects.
   In a functional magnetic resonance imaging study utilizing a
   double-blind placebo-controlled within-subjects design, we measured
   amygdala activation to an emotional face matching task of fearful,
   angry, and happy faces following acute intranasal administration of OXT
   (24 IU or 40.32 mu g) and placebo in 18 GSAD and 18 CON subjects. Both
   the CON and GSAD groups activated bilateral amygdala to all emotional
   faces during placebo, with the GSAD group exhibiting hyperactivity
   specifically to fearful faces in bilateral amygdala compared with the
   CON group. OXT had no effect on amygdala activity to emotional faces in
   the CON group, but attenuated the heightened amygdala reactivity to
   fearful faces in the GSAD group, such that the hyperactivity observed
   during the placebo session was no longer evident following OXT (ie,
   normalization). These findings suggest that OXT has a specific effect on
   fear-related amygdala activity, particularly when the amygdala is
   hyperactive, such as in GSAD, thereby providing a brain-based mechanism
   of the impact of OXT in modulating the exaggerated processing of social
   signals of threat in patients with pathological anxiety.

   expressions while in an fMRI scanner. Overall, shy individuals showed
   heightened neural activation compared with their non-shy counterparts,
   which was conserved across a number of brain loci and a range of
   emotions. Findings are discussed in terms of how heightened sensitivity
   for detecting discrepancies in social environmental stimuli may maintain
   anxiety and avoidance behaviors among people who are shy. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to explore the relationship between emotion
   recognition and affective Theory of Mind (ToM). Forty subjects performed
   a facial emotion recognition and an emotional intention recognition task
   (affective ToM) in an event-related fMRI study. Conjunction analysis
   revealed overlapping activation during both tasks. Activation in some of
   these conjunctly activated regions was even stronger during affective
   ToM than during emotion recognition, namely in the inferior frontal
   gyrus, the superior temporal sulcus, the temporal pole, and the
   amygdala. In contrast to previous studies investigating ToM, we found no
   activation in the anterior cingulate, commonly assumed as the key region
   for ToM. The results point to a close relationship of emotion
   recognition and affective ToM and can be interpreted as evidence for the
   assumption that at least basal forms of ToM occur by an embodied,
   non-cognitive process.}},

Abstract = {{Studies suggest that the affective response is impaired in both
   schizophrenia and adolescent offspring of schizophrenia patients.
   Adolescent offspring of patients are developmentally vulnerable to
   impairments in several domains, including affective responding, yet the
   bases of these impairments and their relation to neuronal responses
   within the limbic system are poorly understood. The amygdala is the
   central region devoted to the processing of emotional valence and its
   sub-nuclei including the baso-lateral and centro-medial are organized in
   a relative hierarchy of affective processing. Outputs from the
   centro-medial nucleus converge on regions involved in the autonomous
   regulation of behavior, and outputs from the baso-lateral nucleus
   modulate the response of reward processing regions. Here using fMRI we
   assessed the intra-amygdala response to positive, negative, and neutral
   valenced faces in a group of controls (with no family history of
   psychosis) and offspring of schizophrenia parents (n = 44 subjects in
   total). Subjects performed an affective continuous performance task
   during which they continually appraised whether the affect signaled by a
   face on a given trial was the same or different from the previous trial
   (regardless of facial identity). Relative to controls, offspring showed
   reduced activity in the left centro-medial nucleus to positively (but
   not negatively or neutral) valenced faces. These results were
   independent of behavioral/cognitive performance (equal across groups)
   suggesting that an impaired affective substrate in the intra-amygdala
   response may lie at the core of deficits of social behavior that have
   been documented in this population. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Studies investigating emotion recognition in patients with schizophrenia
   predominantly presented photographs of facial expressions. Better
   control and higher flexibility of emotion displays could be afforded by
   virtual reality (VR). VR allows the manipulation of facial expression
   and can simulate social interactions in a controlled and yet more
   naturalistic environment. However, to our knowledge, there is no study
   that systematically investigated whether patients with schizophrenia
   show the same emotion recognition deficits when emotions are expressed
   by virtual as compared to natural faces. Twenty schizophrenia patients
   and 20 controls rated pictures of natural and virtual faces with respect
   to the basic emotion expressed (happiness, sadness, anger, fear,
   disgust, and neutrality). Consistent with our hypothesis, the results
   revealed that emotion recognition impairments also emerged for emotions
   expressed by virtual characters. As virtual in contrast to natural
   expressions only contain major emotional features, schizophrenia
   patients already seem to be impaired in the recognition of basic
   emotional features. This finding has practical implication as it
   supports the use of virtual emotional expressions for psychiatric
   research: the ease of changing facial features, animating avatar faces,
   and creating therapeutic simulations makes validated artificial
   expressions perfectly suited to study and treat emotion recognition
   deficits in schizophrenia. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by deficits in social
   and communication processes. Recent data suggest that altered functional
   connectivity (FC), i.e. synchronous brain activity, might contribute to
   these deficits. Of specific interest is the FC integrity of the default
   mode network (DMN), a network active during passive resting states and
   cognitive processes related to social deficits seen in ASD, e.g. Theory
   of Mind. We investigated the role of altered FC of default mode
   sub-networks (DM-SNs) in 16 patients with high-functioning ASD compared
   to 16 matched healthy controls of short resting fMRI scans using
   independent component analysis (ICA). ICA is a multivariate data-driven
   approach that identifies temporally coherent networks, providing a
   natural measure of FC. Results show that compared to controls, patients
   showed decreased FC between the precuneus and medial prefrontal
   cortex/anterior cingulate cortex, DMN core areas, and other DM-SNs
   areas. FC magnitude in these regions inversely correlated with the
   severity of patients' social and communication deficits as measured by
   the Autism Diagnostic Observational Schedule and the Social
   Responsiveness Scale. Importantly, supplemental analyses suggest that
   these results were independent of treatment status. These results
   support the hypothesis that DM-SNs under-connectivity contributes to the
   core deficits seen in ASD. Moreover, these data provide further support
   for the use of data-driven analysis with resting-state data for
   illuminating neural systems that differ between groups. This approach
   seems especially well suited for populations where compliance with and
   performance of active tasks might be a challenge, as it requires minimal
   cooperation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Previous research used animated geometric figures to investigate social
   cognitive processes involved in ascribing mental states to others (e.g.
   mentalizing). The relationship between animacy perception and brain
   areas commonly involved in social cognition, as well as the influence of
   particular motion patterns on animacy experience, however, remains to be
   further elucidated. We used a recently introduced paradigm for the
   systematic variation of motion properties, and employed functional
   magnetic resonance imaging to identify the neural mechanisms underlying
   animacy experience. Based on individual ratings of increased animacy
   experience the following brain regions of the ``social neural
   network{''} (SNN), known to be involved in social cognitive processes,
   were recruited: insula, superior temporal gyros, fusiform gyrus,
   parahippocampal gyrus and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
   bilaterally. Decreased animacy experience was associated with increased
   neural activity in the inferior parietal and inferior frontal gyrus, key
   constituents of the human ``mirror neuron system{''} (hMNS). These
   findings were corroborated when analyses were based on movement patterns
   alone, irrespective of subjective experience. Additionally to the areas
   found for increased animacy experience, an increase in interactive
   movements elicited activity in the amygdala and the temporal pole. In
   conclusion, the results suggest that the hMNS is recruited during a
   low-level stage of animacy judgment representing a basic disposition to
   detect the salience of movements, whereas the SNN appears to be a
   high-level processing component serving evaluation in social and mental
   inference. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The communication of pain requires the perception of pain-related
   signals and the extraction of their meaning and magnitude to infer the
   state of the expresser. Here, BOLD responses were measured in healthy
   volunteers while they evaluated the amount of pain expressed (pain task)
   or discriminated movements (movement task) in one-second video clips
   displaying facial expressions of various levels of pain. Regression
   analysis using subjects' ratings of pain confirmed the parametric
   response of several regions previously involved in the coding of
   self-pain, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior
   insula (aINS), as well as areas implicated in action observation, and
   motor mirroring, such as the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and inferior
   parietal lobule (IPL). Furthermore, the pain task produced stronger
   activation in the ventral IFG, as well as in areas of the medial
   prefrontal cortex (mPFC) associated with social cognition and emotional
   mirroring, whereas stronger activation during the movement task
   predominated in the IPL These results suggest that perception of the
   pain of another via facial expression recruits limbic regions involved
   in the coding of self-pain, prefrontal areas underlying social and
   emotional cognition (i.e. `mentalizing.), and premotor and parietal
   areas involved in motor mirroring. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Kinship, friendship alliances, and perceptions of others' beliefs guide
   social interactions and are central to cohesive group behavior. Under
   certain conditions, brain systems that involve regions along the frontal
   midline increase activity when inferences are drawn about others who
   share a similar view to one's own (similarity). A prominent hypothesis
   is that these regions contribute to social cognition by simulating the
   other person's perspective based on one's own experience. An alternative
   is that certain regions process the social relevance of the person
   (closeness) to oneself and contribute to the assessment akin to signals
   that govern behavioral approach responses. These alternatives were
   explored across four functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments
   (n = 98). Experiment 1 localized the target midline regions in the
   rostral anterior cingulate cortex and anterior medial prefrontal cortex
   by having participants make personal judgments. The two dimensions
   (similarity, closeness) were crossed in experiment 2 using actual
   friends of the participant and unknown others. Making judgments about
   oneself and friends resulted in increased midline response relative to
   unknown others regardless of whether the friends shared similar views as
   the participant. Experiment 3 revealed that similarity was not a factor
   even when close others were not included. Experiment 4 directly
   contrasted two extremes: participants made inferences about similar,
   unknown others and dissimilar friends. Judgments about the close others
   again increased blood oxygenation level-dependent response along the
   frontal midline. These results encourage further exploration of the idea
   that frontal systems linked with limbic circuits facilitate assessment
   of the relevance or personal significance in social contexts.}},

   psychosis: an fMRI study}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN FUNCTIONS}},
Year = {{2010}},

Abstract = {{Background: Individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis have
   self-disturbances and deficits in social cognition and functioning.
   Midline default network areas, including the medial prefrontal cortex
   and posterior cingulate cortex, are implicated in self-referential and
   social cognitive tasks. Thus, the neural substrates within the default
   mode network (DMN) have the potential to mediate self-referential and
   social cognitive information processing in UHR subjects.
   Methods: This study utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) to investigate resting-state DMN and task-related network (TRN)
   functional connectivity in 19 UHR subjects and 20 matched healthy
   controls. The bilateral posterior cingulate cortex was selected as a
   seed region, and the intrinsic organization for all subjects was
   reconstructed on the basis of fMRI time series correlation.
   Results: Default mode areas included the posterior/anterior cingulate
   cortices, the medial prefrontal cortex, the lateral parietal cortex, and
   the inferior temporal region. Task-related network areas included the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor area, the inferior
   parietal lobule, and middle temporal cortex. Compared to healthy
   controls, UHR subjects exhibit hyperconnectivity within the default
   network regions and reduced anti-correlations (or negative correlations
   nearer to zero) between the posterior cingulate cortex and task-related
   areas.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that abnormal resting-state network
   activity may be related with the clinical features of UHR subjects.
   Neurodevelopmental and anatomical alterations of cortical midline
   structure might underlie altered intrinsic networks in UHR subjects.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. Tourette's syndrome is characterised by motor and vocal tics
   as well as a high level of impulsivity and emotional dysregulation.
   Neuroimaging studies point to structural changes of the basal ganglia,
   prefrontal cortex and parts of the limbic system. However, there is no
   link between behavioural symptoms and the structural changes in the
   amygdala. One aspect of daily social interaction is the perception of
   emotional facial expressions, closely linked to amgydala function.
   Methods. We therefore investigated via fMRI the implicit discrimination
   of six emotional facial expressions in 19 adult Tourette's patients.
   Results. In comparison to healthy control group, Tourette's patients
   showed significantly higher amygdala activation, especially pronounced
   for fearful, angry and neutral expressions. The BOLD-activity of the
   left amygdala correlated negatively with the personality trait
   extraversion. Conclusions. We will discuss these findings as a result of
   either deficient frontal inhibition due to structural changes or a
   desynchronization in the interaction of the
   cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical network within structures of the limbic
   system. Our data show an altered pattern of implicit emotion
   discrimination and emphasize the need to consider motor and non-motor
   symptoms in Tourette's syndrome in the choice of both behavioural and
   pharmacological treatment.}},

Title = {{Individuating faces and common objects produces equal responses in
   putative face-processing areas in the ventral occipitotemporal cortex}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 8}},
Abstract = {{Controversy surrounds the proposal that specific human cortical regions
   in the ventral occipitotemporal cortex, commonly called the fusiform
   face area (FFA) and occipital face area (OFA), are specialized for face
   processing. Here, we present findings from an fMRI study of identity
   discrimination of faces and objects that demonstrates the FFA and OFA
   are equally responsive to processing stimuli at the level of individuals
   (i.e., individuation), be they human faces or non-face objects. The FFA
   and OFA were defined via a passive viewing task as regions that produced
   greater activation to faces relative to non-face stimuli within the
   middle fusiform gyrus and inferior occipital gyrus. In the individuation
   task, participants judged whether sequentially presented images of
   faces, diverse objects, or wristwatches depicted the identical or a
   different exemplar. All three stimulus types produced equivalent BOLD
   activation within the FFA and OFA; that is, there was no face-specific
   or face-preferential processing. Critically, individuation processing
   did not eliminate an object superiority effect relative to faces within
   a region more closely linked to object processing in the lateral
   occipital complex (LOC), suggesting that individuation processes are
   reasonably specific to the FFA and OFA. Taken together, these findings
   challenge the prevailing view that the FFA and OFA are face-specific
   processing regions, demonstrating instead that they function to
   individuate - i.e., identify specific individuals - within a category.
   These findings have significant implications for understanding the
   function of brain regions widely believed to play an important role in
   social cognition.}},

Title = {{Facilitating Memory for Novel Characters by Reducing Neural Repetition
   Suppression in the Left Fusiform Cortex}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: The left midfusiform and adjacent regions have been
   implicated in processing and memorizing familiar words, yet its role in
   memorizing novel characters has not been well understood.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Using functional MRI, the present study
   examined the hypothesis that the left midfusiform is also involved in
   memorizing novel characters and spaced learning could enhance the memory
   by enhancing the left midfusiform activity during learning. Nineteen
   native Chinese readers were scanned while memorizing the visual form of
   120 Korean characters that were novel to the subjects. Each character
   was repeated four times during learning. Repetition suppression was
   manipulated by using two different repetition schedules: massed learning
   and spaced learning, pseudo-randomly mixed within the same scanning
   session. Under the massed learning condition, the four repetitions were
   consecutive (with a jittered inter-repetition interval to improve the
   design efficiency). Under the spaced learning condition, the four
   repetitions were interleaved with a minimal inter-repetition lag of 6
   stimuli. Spaced learning significantly improved participants'
   performance during the recognition memory test administered one hour
   after the scan. Stronger left midfusiform and inferior temporal gyrus
   activities during learning (summed across four repetitions) were
   associated with better memory of the characters, based on both
   within-and cross-subjects analyses. Compared to massed learning, spaced
   learning significantly reduced neural repetition suppression and
   increased the overall activities in these regions, which were associated
   with better memory for novel characters.
   Conclusions/Significance: These results demonstrated a strong link
   between cortical activity in the left midfusiform and memory for novel
   characters, and thus challenge the visual word form area (VWFA)
   hypothesis. Our results also shed light on the neural mechanisms of the
   spacing effect in memorizing novel characters.}},

Title = {{Initial, habitual and compulsive alcohol use is characterized by a shift

Abstract = {{Aims
   During the development of drug addiction, initial hedonic effects
   decrease when substance use becomes habitual and ultimately compulsive.
   Animal research suggests that these changes are represented by a
   transition from prefrontal cortical control to subcortical striatal
   control and within the striatum from ventral to dorsal domains of the
   striatum, but only limited evidence exists in humans. In this study we
   address this hypothesis in the context of alcohol dependence.
   Design, setting and participants
   Non-abstinent heavy social drinkers (n = 21, 5.0 +/- 1.5 drinks/day, 13
   of them were alcohol-dependent according to DSM-IV) and light social
   drinkers (n = 10, 0.4 +/- 0.4 drinks/day) were examined.
   Measurements
   We used a cue-reactivity functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   design during which pictures of alcoholic beverages and neutral control
   stimuli were presented.
   Findings
   In the dorsal striatum heavy drinkers showed significant higher
   activations compared to light drinkers, whereas light social drinkers
   showed higher cue-induced fMRI activations in the ventral striatum and
   in prefrontal areas compared to heavy social drinkers {[}region of
   interest analyses, P < 0.05 false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected].
   Correspondingly, ventral striatal activation in heavy drinkers
   correlated negatively with obsessive-compulsive craving, and furthermore
   we found a positive association between cue-induced activation in the
   dorsal striatum and obsessive-compulsive craving in all participants.
   Conclusions
   In line with our hypothesis we found higher cue-induced activation of
   the ventral striatum in social compared to heavy drinkers, and higher
   dorsal striatal activation in heavy drinkers. Increased prefrontal
   activation may indicate that social drinkers activate cortical control
   when viewing alcohol cues, which may prevent the development of heavy
   drinking or alcohol dependence. Our results suggest differentiating
   treatment research depending on whether alcohol use is hedonic or
   compulsive.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with high-functioning autism sometimes exhibit intact or
   superior performance on visuospatial tasks, in contrast to impaired
   functioning in other domains such as language comprehension, executive
   tasks, and social functions. The goal of the current study was to
   investigate the neural bases of preserved visuospatial processing in
   high-functioning autism from the perspective of the cortical
   underconnectivity theory. We used a combination of behavioral,
   functional magnetic resonance imaging, functional connectivity, and
   corpus callosum morphometric methodological tools. Thirteen participants
   with high-functioning autism and 13 controls (age-, IQ-, and
   gender-matched) were scanned while performing an Embedded Figures Task.
   Despite the ability of the autism group to attain behavioral performance
   comparable to the control group, the brain imaging results revealed
   several group differences consistent with the cortical underconnectivity
   account of autism. First, relative to controls, the autism group showed
   less activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal and inferior
   parietal areas and more activation in visuospatial (bilateral superior
   parietal extending to inferior parietal and right occipital) areas.
   Second, the autism group demonstrated lower functional connectivity
   between higher-order working memory/executive areas and visuospatial
   regions (between frontal and parietal-occipital). Third, the size of the
   corpus callosum (an index of anatomical connectivity) was positively
   correlated with frontal posterior (parietal and occipital) functional
   connectivity in the autism group. Thus, even in the visuospatial domain,
   where preserved performance among people with autism is observed, the
   neuroimaging signatures of cortical underconnectivity persist.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies have indicated abnormalities in
   cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuits in patients with
   obsessive-compulsive disorder compared with controls. However, there are
   inconsistencies between studies regarding the exact set of brain
   structures involved and the direction of anatomical and functional
   changes. These inconsistencies may reflect the differential impact of
   environmental and genetic risk factors for obsessive-compulsive disorder
   on different parts of the brain. To distinguish between functional brain
   changes underlying environmentally and genetically mediated
   obsessive-compulsive disorder, we compared task performance and brain
   activation during a Tower of London planning paradigm in monozygotic
   twins discordant (n = 38) or concordant (n = 100) for
   obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Twins who score high on
   obsessive-compulsive symptoms can be considered at high risk for
   obsessive-compulsive disorder. We found that subjects at high risk for
   obsessive-compulsive disorder did not differ from the low-risk subjects
   behaviourally, but we obtained evidence that the high-risk subjects
   differed from the low-risk subjects in the patterns of brain activation
   accompanying task execution. These regions can be separated into those
   that were affected by mainly environmental risk (dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex and lingual cortex), genetic risk (frontopolar cortex, inferior
   frontal cortex, globus pallidus and caudate nucleus) and regions
   affected by both environmental and genetic risk factors (cingulate
   cortex, premotor cortex and parts of the parietal cortex). Our results
   suggest that neurobiological changes related to obsessive-compulsive
   symptoms induced by environmental factors involve primarily the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, whereas neurobiological changes induced
   by genetic factors involve orbitofrontal-basal ganglia structures.
   Regions showing similar changes in high-risk twins from discordant and
   concordant pairs may be part of compensatory networks that keep planning
   performance intact, in spite of cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical
   deficits.}},

   processing, compared to fathers, celebrity or stranger faces. Fathers'
   faces elicited activity in the caudate, a deep brain structure
   associated with feelings of love. These new findings of differential

Abstract = {{The ability to represent false beliefs, is commonly considered as to be
   the critical test for having a Theory of Mind (TOM). For correct
   predictions or explanations of other peoples' behavior it is necessary
   to understand that mental states are sometimes independent of reality
   and misrepresent the real state of the world. In contrast, when people
   hold true beliefs, predictions and explanations about behavior can
   simply be derived from reality. Previous neuroimaging studies with
   adults suggest that the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the
   right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ) are engaged in false belief
   reasoning. However, studies investigating the neural correlates of
   belief reasoning in children are rare. Using cartoon stories that
   depicted an unexpected transfer, we compared false belief reasoning with
   true belief reasoning in children of a narrow age range between 10 and
   12 years and in adults. In both groups, the dorsal medial frontal cortex
   was activated during false versus true belief reasoning. In contrast to
   adults, children did not selectively recruit the rTPJ during false
   belief reasoning. We found a group by belief interaction in the right
   rostral PFC and the posterior cingulate cortex. In these areas, children
   compared to adults showed increased activity associated with false
   belief reasoning in contrast to true belief reasoning. These results
   implicate modulation of the cortical network that underlies false belief
   reasoning during development and far beyond the time children
   successfully master false belief tasks. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Perceptual expertise is traditionally associated with enhanced brain
   activity in response to objects of expertise in category-selective
   visual cortex, primarily face-selective regions. We reevaluated this
   view by investigating whether the brain activity associated with
   expertise in object recognition is limited to category-selective cortex
   and specifically whether the extent of expertise-related activity
   manifests automatically or whether it can be top-down modulated. We
   conducted 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging studies comparing
   changes in hemodynamic activity associated with car expertise in a
   conventional 1-back task (Experiment 1) and when the task relevance of
   cars was explicitly manipulated (Experiment 2). Whole-brain analysis
   unveiled extensive expertise-related activity throughout the visual
   cortex, starting as early as V1 and extending into nonvisual areas.
   However, when the cars were task irrelevant, the expertise-related
   activity drastically diminished, indeed, becoming similar to the
   activity elicited by cars in novices. We suggest that expertise entails
   voluntary top-down engagement of multiple neural networks in addition to
   stimulus-driven activation associated with perceptual mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Perception of dispositions of others revealed by movement is an
   essential ingredient of adaptive daily-life social behavior. Brain
   imaging points to several brain regions involved in visual processing of
   social interaction represented by motion of geometric shapes. However,
   temporal interrelations among these regions remain unknown. Keeping in
   mind that successful visual social perception depends on intact
   communication throughout the brain, we focus here on analysis of the
   induced gamma neuromagnetic response to social interaction revealed by
   motion. A peak of induced gamma activity of 62 Hz was found at 1 s from
   the stimulus onset over the right parieto-temporal junction. Two further
   enhancements in gamma response of lower frequency of 44 Hz occurred at
   1.4 s over the medial prefrontal and posterior temporal cortices in the
   right hemisphere. Subsequent boosts of 44 Hz were found at 1.6 s over
   the left temporal and right posterior temporal cortices. For the first
   time, the findings identify the cortical network engaged in visual
   processing of social interaction revealed by motion and help to better
   understand proper functioning of the social brain circuitry.}},

Abstract = {{Being exposed to fear signals makes us feel threatened and prompts us to
   prepare an adaptive response. In our previous studies, we suggested that
   amygdala (AMG) and premotor cortex (PM) play a role in the preparation
   of the observers' motor response required by the situation. The present
   experiment aimed at assessing how interindividual differences in
   alexithymia-a personality trait associated with deficits in emotional
   reactivity and regulation-influence the neural network associated with
   the perception of fear. Using fMRI, we scanned 34 healthy subjects while
   they were passively observing fearful body expressions. Applying a
   dimensional approach, we performed correlation analyses between
   fear-related brain areas and alexithymia scores among all participants.
   Using a categorical approach, we conducted a between-group comparison
   (13 high vs. 12 low-alexithymia subjects). Our results were three-fold.
   First, the right AMG activity in response to fearful stimuli was
   negatively correlated with the level of difficulty to identify emotions.
   Second, PM activity was linked to reduced subjective emotional
   reactivity. Third, the between-group comparison revealed greater
   activity in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) for high than
   low-alexithymia scorers. Moreover, the relationship between ACC and PM
   was in opposite direction in individuals with high (negative link) and
   low (positive link) alexithymia. Therefore, compared to our previous
   findings, we hereby further reveal how ACC interacts with PM to sustain
   self-regulation of one's own emotional state in response to threatening
   social signals. Moreover, this neural mechanism could account for the
   description of the ``cold-blooded'' personality of individuals with
   alexithymia. Hum Brain Mapp 31:1469-1481,2010. (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are developmental conditions
   characterized by deficits in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal
   communication and obsessive/stereotyped patterns of behaviour. Although
   there is no reliable neurophysiological marker associated with ASDs,
   dysfunction of the parieto-frontal mirror neuron system has been
   suggested as a disturbance linked to the disorder. Mirror neurons (MNs)
   are visuomotor neurons which discharge both when performing and
   observing a goal directed action. Research suggests MNs may have a role
   in imitation, empathy, theory of mind and language. Although the
   research base is small, evidence from functional MRI, transcranial
   magnetic stimulation, and an electroencephalographic component called
   the mu rhythm suggests MNs are dysfunctional in subjects with ASD. These
   deficits are more pronounced when ASD subjects complete tasks with
   social relevance, or that are emotional in nature. Promising research
   has identified that interventions targeting MN related functions such as
   imitation can improve social functioning in ASDs. Boosting the function
   of MNs may improve the prognosis of ASDs, and contribute to diagnostic
   clarity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Strother L, Aldcroft A, Lavell C, Vilis T. Equal degrees of object

   104: 2075-2081, 2010. First published August 18, 2010;
   doi:10.1152/jn.00462.2010. Functional MRI (fMRI) studies of the human
   object recognition system commonly identify object-selective cortical
   regions by comparing blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses to
   objects versus those to scrambled objects. Object selectivity
   distinguishes human lateral occipital cortex (LO) from earlier visual
   areas. Recent studies suggest that, in addition to being object
   selective, LO is retinotopically organized; LO represents both object
   and location information. Although LO responses to objects have been
   shown to depend on location, it is not known whether responses to
   scrambled objects vary similarly. This is important because it would
   suggest that the degree of object selectivity in LO does not vary with
   retinal stimulus position. We used a conventional functional localizer
   to identify human visual area LO by comparing BOLD responses to objects
   versus scrambled objects presented to either the upper (UVF) or lower
   (LVF) visual field. In agreement with recent findings, we found evidence
   of position-dependent responses to objects. However, we observed the
   same degree of position dependence for scrambled objects and thus object
   selectivity did not differ for UVF and LVF stimuli. We conclude that, in
   terms of BOLD response, LO discriminates objects from non-objects
   equally well in either visual field location, despite stronger responses
   to objects in the LVF.}},

Abstract = {{We have discovered changes in brain activation during difficult and easy
   milliseconds timing. Structures engaged in difficult and easier auditory
   temporal-order judgment were identified in 17 young healthy listeners
   presented with paired-white-noises of different durations. Within each
   pair, a short (10 ms) and a long (50 ms) noise was separated by a silent
   gap of 10,60 or 160 ms, corresponding to three levels of task
   difficulty, i.e. difficult, moderate and easy conditions, respectively.
   A block design paradigm was applied. In temporal-order judgment task
   subjects were required to define the order of noises within each pair,
   i.e. short-long or long-short. In the control task they only detected
   the presentation of the stimulus pair. A multiple regression with `task
   difficulty' as a regressor ('difficult', `moderate', `easy') showed
   dynamic changes in neural activity. Increasing activations accompanying
   increased task difficulty were found in both bilateral inferior parietal
   lobuli and inferior frontal gyri, thus, in classic regions related to
   attentional and working memory processes. Conversely, decreased task
   difficulty was accompanied by increasing involvement of more specific
   timing areas, namely bilateral medial frontal gyri and left cerebellum.
   These findings strongly suggest engagement of different neural networks
   in difficult or easier timing and indicate a framework for understanding
   timing representation in the brain. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Objects in the real world are encountered in contexts where they

   examined the neural response to pairs of objects using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Objects positioned to interact
   together activated bilateral lateral occipital complex (LOC) and
   fusiform gyrus. This occurred irrespective of whether the objects were
   attended. In LOC, the effect of positioning objects for action was found
   regardless of whether the objects formed a familiar or unfamiliar action
   pair. In the fusiform gyrus activation was found when objects formed a
   familiar action pair. No changes were apparent in visuomotor (premotor
   and parietal) regions which might reflect a motor-based response to
   objects. These results show that ventral-stream regions respond to the
   interaction between objects, as well as to the sensory and functional
   properties of individual objects. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Several functional MRI (fMRI) activation studies have highlighted
   specific differences in brain response in social anxiety disorder (SAD)
   patients. Little is known, so far, about the changes in the functional
   architecture of resting state networks (RSNs) in SAD during resting
   state. We investigated statistical differences in RSNs on 20 SAD and 20
   controls using independent component analysis. A diffuse impact on
   widely distributed RSNs and selective changes of RSN intrinsic
   functional connectivity were observed in SAD. Functional connectivity
   was decreased in the somato-motor (primary and motor cortices) and
   visual (primary visual cortex) networks, increased in a network
   including medial prefrontal cortex which is thought to be involved in
   self-referential processes, and increased or decreased in the default
   mode network (posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus, bilateral inferior
   parietal gyrus, angular gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and superior and
   medial frontal gyrus) which has been suggested to be involved in
   episodic memory, and self-projection, the dorsal attention network
   (middle and superior occipital gyrus, inferior and superior parietal
   gyrus, and middle and superior frontal gyrus) which is thought to
   mediate goal-directed top-down processing, the core network
   (insula-cingulate cortices) which is associated with task control
   function, and the central-executive network (fronto-parietal cortices).
   A relationship between functional connectivity and disease severity was
   found in specific regions of RSNs, including medial and lateral
   prefrontal cortex, as well as parietal and occipital regions. Our
   results might supply a novel way to look into neuro-pathophysiological
   mechanisms in SAD patients. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Selective functional integration between anterior temporal and distinct

Abstract = {{It has been hypothesized that the experience of different moral
   sentiments such as guilt and indignation is underpinned by activation in
   temporal and fronto-mesolimbic regions and that functional integration
   between these regions is necessary for the differentiated experience of
   these moral sentiments. A recent fMRI study revealed that the right
   superior anterior temporal lobe (ATL) was activated irrespective of the
   context of moral feelings (guilt or indignation). This region has been
   associated with context-independent conceptual social knowledge which
   allows us to make fine-grained differentiations between qualities of
   social behaviours (e.g. ``critical{''} and ``faultfinding{''}). This
   knowledge is required to make emotional evaluations of social behaviour.
   In contrast to the context-independent activation of the ATL, there were
   context-dependent activations within different fronto-mesolimbic regions
   for guilt and indignation. However, it is unknown whether functional
   integration occurs between these regions and whether regional patterns
   of integration are distinctive for the experience of different moral
   sentiments. Here, we used fMRI and psychophysiological interaction
   analysis, an established measure of functional integration to
   investigate this issue. We found selective functional integration
   between the right superior ATL and a subgenual cingulate region during
   the experience of guilt and between the right superior ATL and the
   lateral orbitofrontal cortex for indignation. Our data provide the first
   evidence for functional integration of conceptual social knowledge
   representations in the right superior ATL with representations of
   different feeling contexts in fronto-mesolimbic regions. We speculate
   that this functional architecture allows for the conceptually
   differentiated experience of moral sentiments in healthy individuals.

Abstract = {{The ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) has been implicated in
   social and affectively influenced decision-making Disease in this region
   may have clinical consequences for social judgments in patients with
   frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) To test this hypothesis
   regional cortical activation was monitored with fMRI while healthy
   adults judged the acceptability of brief social scenarios such as
   cutting into a movie ticket line or going through a red light at 2 AM
   The scenarios described (i) a socially neutral condition (II) a variant
   of each scenario containing a negatively valenced feature and (iii) a
   variant containing a positively valenced feature Results revealed that
   healthy adults activated vmPFC during Judgments of negatively valenced
   scenarios relative to positive scenarios and neutral scenarios In a
   comparative behavioral study the same social decision-making paradigm
   was administered to patients with a social disorder due to FTLD Patients
   differed significantly from healthy controls specifically showing less
   sensitivity to negatively valenced features Comparative anatomical
   analysis revealed considerable overlap of vmPFC activation in healthy
   adults and vmPFC cortical atrophy in FTLD patients These converging
   results support the role of vmPFC in social decision-making where
   potentially negative consequences must be considered (C) 2010 Elsevier

Pages = {{3596-3605}},

Abstract = {{The amygdala is thought to perform a number of social functions and has
   received much attention for its role in processing social properties of
   faces In particular it has been shown to respond more to facial
   expressions than to neutral faces and more to positively valenced and
   negatively valenced faces than faces in the middle of the continuum
   However when these findings are viewed in the context of a
   multidimensional face space an important question emerges Face space is
   a vector space where every face can be represented as a point in the
   space The origin of the space represents the average face In this
   context positively valenced and negatively valenced faces are further
   away from the average face than faces in the middle of the continuum It
   is therefore unclear if the amygdala response to positively valenced and
   negatively valenced faces is due to their social properties or to their
   general distance from the average face Here we compared the amygdala
   response to a set of faces that varied along two dimensions centered
   around the average face but differing in social content In both the
   amygdala and much of the posterior face network we observed a similar
   response to both dimensions with stronger responses to the extremes of
   the dimensions than to faces near the average face These findings
   suggest that the responses in these regions to socially relevant faces
   may be partially due to general distance from the average face (C) 2010

Abstract = {{This experiment tests how people produce and detect deception while
   playing a computerized version of the dice game Meyer Deception is an
   integral part of this game and the participants played it as in real
   life without constraints on whether or when to attempt to deceive their
   opponent and whether or when to accuse them of deception We stress that
   deception is a complex act that cannot be exclusively associated with
   telling a falsehood and that it is facilitated by hierarchical
   decision-making and risk evaluation In comparison with a non-competitive
   control condition both claiming truthfully and claiming falsely were
   associated with activity in fronto-polar cortex (BA10) However relative
   to true claims false claims were associated with greater activity in the
   premotor and parietal cortices We speculate that the activity in BA10 is
   associated with the development of high-level executive strategies
   Involved in both types of claim while the premotor and parietal activity
   is associated with the need to select which particular claim to make (C)

Abstract = {{Background. Schizophrenia out-patients have deficits in affective theory
   of mind (ToM) but also on more basal levels of social cognition, such as
   the processing of neutral and emotional expressions. These deficits are
   associated with changes in brain activation in the amygdala and the
   superior temporal sulcus (STS). However, until now there have been no
   studies that examined these different levels of social cognition and
   their neurobiological underpinnings in patients within one design.
   Method. Sixteen medicated schizophrenia out-patients and 16 matched
   healthy controls were studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) during a social cognition task that allows the investigation of
   affective ToM (aToM), emotion recognition and the processing of neutral
   facial expressions.
   Results. Patients showed a deficit in emotion recognition and a more
   prominent deficit in aToM. The performance in aToM and in emotion
   recognition was correlated in the control group but not in the
   schizophrenia group. Region-of-interest analysis of functional brain
   imaging data revealed no difference between groups during aToM, but a
   hyperactivation in the schizophrenia group in the left amygdala and
   right STS during emotion recognition and the processing of neutral
   facial expressions.
   Conclusions. The results indicate that schizophrenia out-patients have
   deficits at several levels of social cognition and provide the first
   evidence that deficits on higher-order social cognitive processes in
   schizophrenia may be traced back to an aberrant processing of faces per
   se.}},

Title = {{Three cases of developmental prosopagnosia from one family: Detailed

Abstract = {{A number of reports have documented that developmental prosopagnosia
   (DP) can run in families, but the locus of the deficits in those cases
   remains unclear. We investigated the perceptual basis of three cases of
   DP from one family (67 year-old father FA, and two daughters, 39
   year-old D1 and 34 year-old D2) by combining neuropsychological and
   psychophysical methods. Neuropsychological tests involving natural
   facial images demonstrated significant face recognition deficits in the
   three family members. All three members showed normal facial expression
   recognition and face detection, and two of them (D2, FA) performed well
   on within-class object recognition tasks. These individuals were then
   examined in a series of psychophysical experiments. Intermediate form
   vision preceding face perception was assessed with radial frequency (RF)
   patterns. Normal discrimination of RF patterns in these individuals
   indicates that their face recognition difficulties are higher in the
   cortical form vision hierarchy than the locus of contour shape
   processing. Psychophysical experiments requiring discrimination and
   memory for synthetic faces aimed to quantify their face processing
   abilities and systematically examine the representation of facial
   geometry across viewpoints. D1 showed deficits in perceiving geometric
   information from the face at a given view. D2's impairments seem to
   arise in later face processing stages involving transferring
   view-dependent descriptions into a view-invariant representation. FA
   performed poorly on face learning and recognition relative to the
   age-appropriate controls. These cases provide evidence for familial
   transmission of high-level visual recognition deficits with normal
   intermediate-level form vision. (C) 2009 Elsevier Srl. All rights

Title = {{The Role of Contralesional Dorsal Premotor Cortex after Stroke as

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{Contralesional dorsal premotor cortex (cPMd) may support residual motor
   function following stroke. We performed two complementary experiments to
   explore how cPMd might perform this role in a group of chronic human
   stroke patients. First, we used paired-coil transcranial magnetic
   stimulation (TMS) to establish the physiological influence of cPMd on
   ipsilesional primary motor cortex (iM1) at rest. We found that this
   influence became less inhibitory/more facilitatory in patients with
   greater clinical impairment. Second, we applied TMS over cPMd during
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in these patients to
   examine the causal influence of cPMd TMS on the whole network of
   surviving cortical motor areas in either hemisphere and whether these
   influences changed during affected hand movement. We confirmed that hand
   grip-related activation in cPMd was greater in more impaired patients.
   Furthermore, the peak ipsilesional sensorimotor cortex activity shifted
   posteriorly in more impaired patients. Critical new findings were that
   concurrent TMS-fMRI results correlated with the level of both clinical
   impairment and neurophysiological impairment (i.e., less inhibitory/more
   facilitatory cPMd-iM1 measure at rest as assessed with paired-coil TMS).
   Specifically, greater clinical and neurophysiological impairment was
   associated with a stronger facilitatory influence of cPMd TMS on blood
   oxygenation level-dependent signal in posterior parts of ipsilesional
   sensorimotor cortex during hand grip, corresponding to the posteriorly
   shifted sensorimotor activity seen in more impaired patients. cPMd TMS
   was not found to influence activity in other brain regions in either
   hemisphere. This state-dependent influence on ipsilesional sensorimotor
   regions may provide a mechanism by which cPMd supports recovered
   function after stroke.}},

   Personality Traits}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: The posteromedial cortex (PMC) and medial prefrontal cortex
   (mPFC) are part of a network of brain regions that has been found to
   exhibit decreased activity during goal-oriented tasks. This network is
   thought to support a baseline of brain activity, and is commonly
   referred to as the ``default network''. Although recent reports suggest
   that the PMC and mPFC are associated with affective, social, and
   self-referential processes, the relationship between these default
   network components and personality traits, especially those pertaining
   to social context, is poorly understood.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: In the current investigation, we
   assessed the relationship between PMC and mPFC deactivations and
   psychopathic personality traits using fMRI and a self-report measure. We
   found that PMC deactivations predicted traits related to egocentricity
   and mPFC deactivations predicted traits related to decision-making.
   Conclusions/Significance: These results suggest that the PMC and mPFC
   are associated with processes involving self-relevancy and affective
   decision-making, consistent with previous reports. More generally, these
   findings suggest a link between default network activity and personality
   traits.}},

Abstract = {{In most cases obesity, a major risk factor for diabetes mellitus type 2
   and other associated chronic diseases, is generated by excessive eating.
   For a better understanding of eating behavior, it is necessary to
   determine how it is modulated by factors such as the calorie content of
   food, satiety and gender. Twelve healthy normal weighted participants
   (six female) were investigated in a functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) study. In order to prevent the influence of social
   acceptability, an implicit one-back task was chosen for stimulus
   presentation. We presented food (high- and low-caloric) and non-food
   pictures in a block design and subjects had to indicate by button press
   whether two consecutive pictures were the same or not. Each subject
   performed the task in a hungry and satiated state on two different days.
   High-caloric pictures compared to low-caloric pictures led to increased
   activity in food processing and reward related areas, like the
   orbitofrontal and the insular cortex. In addition, we found activation
   differences in visual areas (occipital lobe), despite the fact that the
   stimuli were matched for their physical features. Detailed investigation
   also revealed gender specific effects in the fusiform gyrus. Women
   showed higher activation in the fusiform gyrus while viewing
   high-caloric pictures in the hungry state. This study shows that the
   calorie content of food pictures modulates the activation of brain areas
   related to reward processing and even early visual areas. In addition,
   satiation seems to influence the processing of food pictures differently
   in men and women. Even though an implicit task was used, activation
   differences could also be observed in the orbitofrontal cortex, known to
   be activated during explicit stimulation with food related stimuli. (C)

Abstract = {{Aim: This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study examined
   reactivity to alcohol, polydrug, marijuana and emotional picture cues in
   students who were referred to a college alcohol and drug assistance
   program. Methods: The fMRI data of 10 participants (5 females; 5 males)
   were collected while they viewed standardized emotional and appetitive
   cues. Results: Positive and negative emotional cues produced greater
   activity than neutral cues in the expected brain areas. Compared with
   neutral cues, alcohol cues produced greater brain activation in the
   right insula, left anterior cingulate, left caudate and left prefrontal
   cortex (Z = 2.01, 1.86, 1.82, 1.81, respectively; P < 0.05). Drug cues
   produced significantly greater left prefrontal activity compared with
   neutral cues, with polydrug cues activating the right insula and
   marijuana cues activating left anterior cingulate. Conclusions: Students
   at-risk for alcohol abuse showed neural reactivity to alcohol cues in
   four brain regions, which is consistent with their greater use of
   alcohol. Insula activation to appetitive cues may be an early marker of
   risk for progression to alcohol/drug abuse.}},

   Level-Dependent Response to Threat-Related Emotional Faces in Women with

Abstract = {{Background: Intimate-partner violence (IPV) is one of the most common
   causes of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among women. PTSD
   neuroimaging studies have identified functional differences in the
   amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)/medial prefrontal cortex
   during emotion processing. Recent investigations of the limbic sensory
   system and its associated neural substrate, the insular cortex, have
   demonstrated its importance for emotional awareness. This study examined
   the hypothesis that women with IPV-PTSD show a dysregulation of this
   limbic sensory system while processing threat-related emotional faces.
   Methods: 12 women with IPV-PTSD and 12 nontraumatized comparison women
   underwent blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic
   resonance imaging while completing an emotional face-matching task.
   Results: IPV-PTSD subjects relative to comparison subjects displayed
   increased activation of the anterior insula and amygdala and decreased
   connectivity among the anterior insula, amygdala, and ACC while matching
   to fearful versus happy target faces. A similar pattern of activation
   differences was also observed for angry versus happy target faces.
   IPV-PTSD subjects relative to comparison subjects also displayed
   increased dorsal ACC/medial prefrontal cortex activation and decreased
   ventral ACC activation when matching to a male versus a female target,
   and the extent of increased dorsal ACC activation correlated positively
   with hyperarousal symptoms.
   Conclusions: Women with IPV-PTSD display hyperactivity and disconnection
   among affective and limbic sensory systems while processing
   threat-related emotion. Furthermore, hyperactivity of
   cognitive-appraisal networks in IPV-PTSD may promote hypervigilant
   states of awareness through an exaggerated sensitivity to contextual
   cues, i.e., male gender, which relate to past trauma.}},

Abstract = {{The processing of human bodies is important in social life and for the
   recognition of another person's actions, moods, and intentions. Recent
   neuroimaging studies on mental imagery of human body parts suggest that
   the left hemisphere is dominant in body processing. However, studies on
   mental imagery of full human bodies reported stronger right hemisphere
   or bilateral activations. Here, we measured functional magnetic
   resonance imaging during mental imagery of bilateral partial (upper) and
   full bodies. Results show that, independently of whether a full or upper
   body is processed, the right hemisphere (temporo-parietal cortex,
   anterior parietal cortex, premotor cortex, bilateral superior parietal
   cortex) is mainly involved in mental imagery of full or partial human
   bodies. However, distinct activations were found in extrastriate cortex
   for partial bodies (right fusiform face area) and full bodies (left
   extrastriate body area). We propose that a common brain network, mainly
   on the right side, is involved in the mental imagery of human bodies,
   while two distinct brain areas in extrastriate cortex code for mental
   imagery of full and upper bodies.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial perspective taking is an everyday cognitive process that is
   involved in predicting the outcome of goal directed behavior We used
   dynamic virtual stimuli and fMRI to investigate at the neural level
   whether motion perception interacts with spatial perspective taking in a
   life-like design Subjects were asked to perform right-left-decisions
   about the position of either a motionless, hovering (STATIC) or a flying
   ball (DYNamic), either from their own (I PP) or from the perspective of
   a virtual character (avatar, 3PP) Our results showed a significant
   interaction of STIMULUS TYPE and PERSPECTIVE with significantly
   increased activation in right posterior intraparietal sulcus (IPS) for
   1PPDYN condition As the IPS is critically involved in the computation of
   object-directed action preparation, we suppose that the simple
   perception of potentially action-relevant dynamic objects induces a
   `readiness for (re)action', restricted to the 1PP. Results are discussed
   against the background of current theories on embodiment and enactive

Abstract = {{The purpose of the present study was to establish a short paradigm for
   the examination of classical aversive conditioning processes for
   application in patients with anxiety disorders. We measured behavioral,
   autonomic and neural correlates of the paradigm in healthy subjects,
   applying functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and measurement of
   skin conductance. Therefore, neutral visual stimuli were paired with an
   unpleasant white noise as unconditioned stimulus. Twenty healthy
   subjects performed three experimental phases of learning:
   familiarization, acquisition and extinction. Subjective ratings of
   valence and arousal after each phase of conditioning as well as skin
   conductance measurement indicated successful conditioning. During
   acquisition, fMRI results showed increased activation for the
   conditioned stimulus (CS+(unpaired)) when compared with the
   non-conditioned stimulus (CS-) in the right amygdala, the insulae, the
   anterior cingulate cortex and the parahippocampal gyrus, all regions
   known to be involved in emotional processing. In addition, a linearly
   decreasing activation in the right amygdala/hippocampus for the CS-
   across the acquisition phase was found. There were no significant
   differences between CS+ and CS- during extinction. In conclusion, the
   applicability of this paradigm for the evaluation of neural correlates
   in conditioning and extinction processes has been proven. Thus, we
   present a promising paradigm for the examination of the fear-circuit in
   patients with anxiety disorders and additionally effects of
   cognitive-behavioral interventions.}},

Abstract = {{It has been suggested that in humans the mirror neuron system provides a
   neural substrate for imitation behaviour, but the relative contributions
   of different brain regions to the imitation of manual actions is still a
   matter of debate To investigate the role of the mirror neuron system in
   imitation we used fMRI to examine patterns of neural activity under four
   different conditions passive observation of a pantomimed action (e.g.,
   hammering a nail), (2) imitation of an observed action, (3) execution of
   an action in response to a word cue, and (4) self-selected execution of
   an action A network of cortical areas, including the left supramarginal
   gyrus, left superior parietal lobule, left dorsal premotor area and
   bilateral superior temporal sulcus (STS), was significantly active
   across all four conditions Crucially, within this network the STS
   bilaterally was the only region in which activity was significantly
   greater for action imitation than for the passive observation and
   execution conditions We suggest that the role of the STS in imitation is
   not merely to passively register observed biological motion, but rather
   to actively represent visuomotor correspondences between one's own
   actions and the actions of others Hum Brain Mapp 31.1316-1326, 2010 (C)

Abstract = {{Acute psychosocial stress in humans triggers the release of
   glucocorticoids (GCs) and influences performance in declarative and
   working memory (WM) tasks. These memory systems rely on the hippocampus
   and prefrontal cortex (PFC), where GC-binding receptors are present
   Previous studies revealed contradictory results regarding effects of
   acute stress on WM-related brain activity We combined functional
   magnetic resonance imaging with a standardized psychosocial stress
   protocol to investigate the effects of acute mental stress on brain
   activity during encoding, maintenance, and retrieval of WM. Participants
   (41 healthy young men) underwent either a stress or a control procedure
   before performing a WM task. Stress increased salivary cortisol levels
   and tended to increase WM accuracy Neurally, stress-induced increases in
   cortical activity were evident in PFC and posterior parietal cortex
   (PPC) during WM maintenance Furthermore, hippocampal activity was
   modulated by stress during encoding and retrieval with increases in the
   right anterior hippocampus during WM encoding and decreases in the left
   posterior hippocampus during retrieval Our study demonstrates that
   stress increases activity in PFC and PPC specifically during maintenance
   of items in WM, whereas effects on hippocampal activity are restricted
   to encoding and retrieval The finding that psychosocial stress can
   increase and decrease activity in two different hippocampal areas may be
   relevant for understanding the often-reported phase-dependent opposing

Abstract = {{Introduction: ADHD has a high comorbidity with substance use disorders
   (SUD). Both diseases have profound social, psychological, and economic
   consequences and are therefore highly relevant for health systems. The
   high comorbidity indicates some shared underlying neurobiological
   substrates. Knowing these substrates may increase the understanding of
   the disease and help identify therapeutic processes. Method:
   Neuroimaging studies of ADHD were reviewed and similarities with SUD
   identified. For this a PubMed research was conducted with the search
   terms ADHD, SUD, MRI or positron emission tomography (PET) or
   spectroscopy or imaging. Results: Similarities were found, in both PET
   and fMRI studies, between patients with ADHD and those with
   addiction-related craving. Results from structural MRI and MR
   spectroscopy do not support a common pathophysiological background,
   probably because of the lack of studies on craving. Discussion: ADHD and
   SUD-related craving share some neurobiological similarities. One reason
   may be that patients with addiction show more craving when they also
   suffer from ADHD. The present review thus supports the conclusion from
   an earlier meta-analysis of clinical studies which found that adequate
   treatment of ADHD reduces craving and relapse into substance use. (J. of
   Att. Dis. 2010; XX(X) I-XX)}},

Abstract = {{We recorded intracranial local field potentials from structurally intact
   human visual cortex during several face processing tasks in a patient
   before brain surgery. Intracranial local field potentials were measured
   from subdural electrodes implanted in a right fusiform region with
   face-sensitive activity and a more medial location in posterior
   parahippocampal gyrus with house-selective activity. This electrode
   implantation allowed us to compare neural responses with different
   facial properties within two adjacent but functionally distinct cortical
   regions. Five experiments were conducted to determine the temporal
   dynamics of perceptual (Experiments 1 and 5), emotional (Experiments 2
   and 3), and social (Experiment 4) effects on face-specific responses in
   the right fusiform. Our findings showed an early negative deflection
   (N200) that primarily reflected category-selective perceptual encoding
   of facial information, whereas higher order effects of face
   individuation, emotional expression, and gaze direction produced
   selective modulations in the same face-specific region during a later
   time period (from 200 to 1000 msec after onset). These results shed new
   lights on the time course of face recognition mechanisms in human visual
   cortex and reveal for the first time anatomically overlapping but
   temporally distinct influences of identity or emotional/social factors
   on face processing in right fusiform gyrus, which presumably reflect
   top-down feedback effects from distant brain areas.}},

   10.1152/jn.00870.2009. Reward can influence visual performance, but the
   neural basis of this effect remains poorly understood. Here we used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate how rewarding
   feedback affected activity in distinct areas of human visual cortex,
   separating rewarding feedback events after correct performance from
   preceding visual events. Participants discriminated oriented gratings in
   either hemifield, receiving auditory feedback at trial end that signaled
   financial reward after correct performance. Greater rewards improved
   performance for all but the most difficult trials. Rewarding feedback
   increased blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals in striatum and
   orbitofrontal cortex. It also increased BOLD signals in visual areas
   beyond retinotopic cortex, but not in primary visual cortex representing
   the judged stimuli. These modulations were seen at a time point in which
   no visual stimuli were presented or expected, demonstrating a novel type
   of activity change in visual cortex that cannot reflect modulation of
   response to incoming or anticipated visual stimuli. Rewarded trials led
   on the next trial to improved performance and enhanced visual activity
   contralateral to the judged stimulus, for retinotopic representations of
   the judged visual stimuli in V1. Our findings distinguish general
   effects in nonretinotopic visual cortex when receiving rewarding
   feedback after correct performance from consequences of reward for
   spatially specific responses in V1.}},

Abstract = {{Perception is not simply based on a hierarchical organization of the
   brain; it arises from an interplay between inputs from the environment
   and internal predictions of these inputs. It is an active process which
   involves an interaction between bottom-up information coming from the
   senses and feedback connections coming from higher-order cortical areas.
   In our experiment, we use the hollow-mask illusion to investigate the
   strength of top-down processes in schizophrenic patients and healthy
   controls. By using dynamic causal modelling (DCM) on functional magnetic
   resonance tomography (fMRI) data, we have presented evidence to suggest
   that patients with schizophrenia are less constrained by top-down
   processes during perception (Dima, D., Roiser, J.P., Dietrich, D.E.,
   Bonnemann, C., Lanfermann, H., Emrich, H.M., Dillo, W., 2009.
   Understanding why patients with schizophrenia do not perceive the
   hollow-mask illusion using dynamic causal modeling. Neuroimage 46,
   1180-1186). In this study, we re-address this issue by using DCM on
   event-related potentials (ERPs) data. Our aim was to validate our
   previous findings by conducting the same connectivity analysis - DCM -
   on data obtained from a different neuroimaging method. Our results
   confirm our initial hypothesis that top-down influences are constrained
   in schizophrenia, especially in perceptual tasks that require top-down
   control, like the hollow-mask illusion. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Despite being studied intensively over the past 30 years, the neural
   processes underlying visual search are not yet fully understood. In the
   current study we extend prior work using model-based analysis to
   decompose fMRI data. fMRI data on human search were assessed using
   activation functions predicted from the spiking Search over Time and
   Space model (sSoTS; Mavritsaki et al., 2006). Going beyond previous
   work, we show for the first time that activity in a central location map
   in the model, which computes the saliency of a target relative to
   distractors, correlated with the BOLD response in the right
   temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) - a key region implicated in clinical
   studies of unilateral neglect. This is consistent with the right TPJ
   responding to the relative saliency of visual stimuli. In addition, a
   re-analysis of search performance, with a larger participant set and a
   psychologically plausible response rule, showed distinct neural regions
   in parietal and occipital cortices linked to top-down excitation and the
   to active ignoring of distractors. The results indicate that excitatory
   and inhibitory circuits for visual selection can be separated, and that
   the right TPJ may be critical for responding to salient targets. The
   value of using a model-based approach is discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This study examined the neural basis of framing effects using life-death
   decision problems framed either positively in terms of lives saved or
   negatively in terms of lives lost in large group and small group
   contexts. Using functional MRI we found differential brain activations
   to the verbal and social cues embedded in the choice problems. In large
   group contexts, framing effects were significant where participants were
   more risk seeking under the negative (loss) framing than under the
   positive (gain) framing. This behavioral difference in risk preference
   was mainly regulated by the activation in the right inferior frontal
   gyrus, including the homologue of the Broca's area. In contrast, framing
   effects diminished in small group contexts while the insula and parietal
   lobe in the right hemisphere were distinctively activated, suggesting an
   important role of emotion in switching choice preference from an
   indecisive mode to a more consistent risk-taking inclination, governed
   by a kith-and-kin decision rationality. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{There is strong evidence of sex differences in mental rotation tasks.
   Transsexualism is an extreme gender identity disorder in which
   individuals seek cross-gender treatment to change their sex. The aim of
   our study was to investigate if male-to-female (MF) and female-to-male
   (FM) transsexuals receiving cross-sex hormonal treatment have different
   patterns of cortical activation during a three-dimensional (3D) mental
   rotation task. An fMRI study was performed using a 3-T scan in a sample
   of 18 MF and 19 FM under chronic cross-sex hormonal treatment.
   Twenty-three males and 19 females served as controls. The general
   pattern of cerebral activation seen while visualizing the rotated and
   non-rotated figures was similar for all four groups showing strong
   occipito-parieto-frontal brain activation. However, compared to control
   males, the activation of MF transsexuals during the task was lower in
   the superior parietal lobe. Compared to control females, MF transsexuals
   showed higher activation in orbital and right dorsolateral prefrontal
   regions and lower activation in the left prefrontal gyrus. FM
   transsexuals did not differ from either the MF transsexual or control
   groups. Regression analyses between cerebral activation and the number
   of months of hormonal treatment showed a significant negative
   correlation in parietal, occipital and temporal regions in the MF
   transsexuals. No significant correlations with time were seen in the FM
   transsexuals. In conclusion, although we did not find a specific pattern
   of cerebral activation in the FM transsexuals, we have identified a
   specific pattern of cerebral activation during a mental 3D rotation task
   in MF transsexuals under cross-sex hormonal treatment that differed from
   control males in the parietal region and from control females in the
   orbital prefrontal region. The hypoactivation in MF transsexuals in the
   parietal region could be due to the hormonal treatment or could reflect
   a priori cerebral differences between MF transsexual and control
   subjects. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, the startle reflex was examined with respect to

   participants viewed faces that were morphed to display 0, 20, 40, 60,

   to 100\%, faces were perceived as increasingly angry; however, relative
   to neutral facial expressions, startle amplitude was only potentiated to
   maximally angry faces. These data imply a non-linear relationship
   between the intensity of angry faces and defensive physiological
   activity. This pattern of startle modulation suggests a categorical
   distinction between threatening (100\% anger) and other facial
   expressions presented. These results are further discussed in terms of

Abstract = {{The following fMRI study aimed to characterize the neural correlates of
   explicit emotion discrimination in 17 patients with schizophrenia and 17
   matched healthy controls. In patients, emotion recognition impairments
   were found to be paralleled by cerebral dysfunctions in the affective
   division of the anterior cingulate cortex, the bilateral dorsomedial
   prefrontal cortex, the right superior temporal gyrus and the right
   fusiform gyrus. While the patients' responses to emotional faces were
   characterized predominantly by hypoactivations, the neutral faces
   elicited hyperactivations mainly in the frontal and cingulate areas, and
   the basal ganglia, along with misattribution errors. The decreased
   activation in the fusiform face area during responses to both emotional
   and neutral stimuli may be indicative of general face processing
   deficits. Similar although less pronounced deficits have been observed
   in subjects at high risk of psychosis as well as in patients with early
   onset. In adult schizophrenia, the evidence of an imbalanced cerebral
   network appears early in the course of the illness, with the
   dysfunctions, as indicated by correlations here, becoming more
   pronounced in patients with longer illness duration. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objective: The goal of this study was to investigate whether dysplastic
   amygdalae show an impaired response as revealed by functional MRI
   (fMRI).
   Methods: A fearful face fMRI paradigm using video sequences, as we have
   recently applied, was used in 25 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy
   (TLE): 24 had mesial TLE (14 right-, nine left-sided, one bilateral);
   one left lateral neocortical TLE. T1-, T2-weighted and fluid attenuated
   inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI sequences were assessed for the detection
   and categorisation of structural amygdalar abnormalities according to
   size and MR signal intensity. Of the 25 patients, five patients had
   probable dysplastic amygdala (pDA): two right- and three left-sided.
   Results: A fearful face paradigm led to significant amygdalar activation
   in all but one patient (p < 0.05). In 15 (60\%) of the patients
   amygdalar activation was found contralateral and in four (16\%)
   ipsilateral to the side of seizure onset. Bilateral amygdalar activation
   was registered in five (20\%) patients. In two patients with right-sided
   and one with left-sided pDA, fMRI activation was observed only in the
   contralateral amygdala. In two out of three patients with left-sided pDA
   we found significant ipislateral amygdalar fMRI-responses.
   Conclusion: Unilateral pDA does not necessarily affect the amygdalar
   fMRI BOLD-response. (C) 2010 British Epilepsy Association. Published by

Abstract = {{Live theater is typically designed to alter the state of mind of the
   audience. Indeed, the perceptual inputs issuing from a live theatrical
   performance are intended to represent something else, and the actions,
   emphasized by the writing and staging, are the key prompting the
   adhesion of viewers to fiction, i.e., their belief that it is real. This
   phenomenon raises the issue of the cognitive processes governing access
   to a fictional reality during live theater and of their cerebral
   underpinnings. To get insight into the physiological substrates of
   adhesion we recreated the peculiar context of watching live drama in a
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment, with
   simultaneous recording of heart activity. The instants of adhesion were
   defined as the co-occurrence of theatrical events determined a priori by
   the stage director and the spectators' offline reports of moments when
   fiction acted as reality. These data served to specify, for each
   spectator, individual fMRI time-series, used in a random-effect group
   analysis to define the pattern of brain response to theatrical events.
   The changes in this pattern related to subjects' adhesion to fiction,
   were investigated using a region of interest analysis. The results
   showed that adhesion to theatrical events correlated with increased
   activity in the left BA47 and posterior superior temporal sulcus,
   together with a decrease in dynamic heart rate variability, leading us
   to discuss the hypothesis of subtle changes in the subjects' state of
   awareness, enabling them to mentally dissociate physical and mental
   (drama-viewing) experiences, to account for the phenomenon of adhesion
   to dramatic fiction.}},

Title = {{Quality of life in childhood epilepsy with lateralized epileptogenic
   foci}},
Journal = {{BMC NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{AUG 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Measuring quality of life (QOL) helps to delineate
   mechanisms underlying the interaction of disease and psychosocial
   factors. In adults, epileptic foci in the left temporal lobe led to
   lower QOL and higher depression and anxiety as compared to the
   right-sided foci. No study addressed the development of QOL disturbances
   depending on the lateralization of epileptogenic focus. The objective of
   our study was to examine QOL in children with lateralized epileptiform
   discharges.
   Methods: Thirty-one parents of children with epilepsy filled the
   Health-Related Quality of Life in Childhood Epilepsy Questionnaire
   (QOLCE). Fifteen children had foci in the left hemisphere and sixteen in
   the right, as verified with Electroencephalography (EEG) examinations.
   Results: We found a significant correlation between foci lateralization
   and reduced QOL (Spearman's rho = 0.361, p < 0.046). Children with right
   hemispheric foci exhibited lower overall QOL, particularly in five
   areas: anxiety, social-activities, stigma, general-health, and
   quality-of-life.
   Conclusions: We demonstrated for the first time that in children
   left-and right-hemispheric foci were associated with discordant QOL
   scores. Unlike in adults, foci in the right hemisphere led to worse
   emotional and social functioning demonstrating that seizures impact the
   brain differentially during development.}},

Abstract = {{Although stress-induced increases in inflammation have been implicated
   in several major disorders, including cardiovascular disease and
   depression, the neurocognitive pathways that underlie inflammatory
   responses to stress remain largely unknown. To examine these processes,
   we recruited 124 healthy young adult participants to complete a
   laboratory-based social stressor while markers of inflammatory activity
   were obtained from oral fluids. A subset of participants (n = 31) later
   completed an fMRI session in which their neural responses to social
   rejection were assessed. As predicted, exposure to the laboratory-based
   social stressor was associated with significant increases in two markers
   of inflammatory activity, namely a soluble receptor for tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha (sTNF alpha RII) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). In the
   neuroimaging subsample, greater increases in sTNFaRII (but not IL-6)
   were associated with greater activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate
   cortex and anterior insula, brain regions that have previously been
   associated with processing rejection-related distress and negative
   affect. These data thus elucidate a neurocognitive pathway that may be
   involved in potentiated inflammatory responses to acute social stress.
   As such, they have implications for understanding how social stressors
   may promote susceptibility to diseases with an inflammatory component.}},

Abstract = {{To characterize peritumoral BOLD contrast disorders, 25 patients
   referred for resection of primary frontal or parietal neoplasms
   (low-grade glioma (LGG) (n = 8); high-grade glioma (HGG) (n = 7);
   meningioma (n = 10)) without macroscopic tumoral infiltration of the
   primary sensorimotor cortex (SM1) were examined preoperatively using
   BOLD fMRI during simple motor tasks. Overall cerebral BOLD signal was
   estimated using vasoreactivity to carbogen inhalation. Using bolus of
   gadolinium, cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and
   mean transit time (MTT) were estimated. In a 1 cm(3) region-of-interest
   centered on maximal T-value in SM1 contralateral to movements,
   interhemispheric asymmetry was evaluated using interhemispheric ratios
   for BOLD and perfusion parameters. During motor tasks contralateral to
   the tumor, ipsitumoral sensorimotor activations were decreased in HGG
   and meningiomas, correlated to the distance between the tumor and SM1.
   Whereas CBV was decreased in ipsitumoral SM1 for HGG, it remained normal
   in meningiomas. Changes in basal perfusion could not explain motor
   activation impairment in SM1. Decreased interhemispheric ratio of the
   BOLD response to carbogen was the best predictor to model the asymmetry
   of motor activation (R = 0.51). Moreover, 94.9 +/- 4.9\% of all motor
   activations overlapped significant BOLD response to carbogen inhalation.

Abstract = {{In social decision-making, people care both about others' outcomes and
   their intentions to help or harm. How the brain integrates
   representations of others' intentions with their outcomes, however, is
   unknown. In this study, participants inferred others' decisions in an
   economic game during functional magnetic resonance imaging. When the
   game was described in terms of donations, ventromedial prefrontal cortex
   (VMPFC) activation increased for inferring generous play and decreased
   for inferring selfish play. When the game was described in terms of
   individual savings, however, VMPFC activation did not distinguish
   between strategies. Distinct medial prefrontal regions also encoded
   consistency with situational norms. A separate network, including right
   temporoparietal junction and parahippocampal gyrus, was more activated
   for inferential errors in the donation than in the savings condition.
   These results demonstrate that neural responses to others' generosity or
   selfishness depend not only on their actions but also on their perceived
   intentions.}},

Abstract = {{Successful social behavior requires the accurate detection of other
   people's movements. Consistent with this, typical observers demonstrate
   enhanced visual sensitivity to human movement relative to equally
   complex, nonhuman movement {[}e.g., Pinto \& Shiffrar, 2009]. A
   psychophysical study investigated visual sensitivity to human motion
   relative to object motion in observers with autism spectrum disorder
   (ASD). Participants viewed point-light depictions of a moving person
   and, for comparison, a moving tractor and discriminated between coherent
   and scrambled versions of these stimuli in unmasked and masked displays.
   There were three groups of participants: young adults with ASD,
   typically developing young adults, and typically developing children.
   Across masking conditions, typical observers showed enhanced visual
   sensitivity to human movement while observers in the ASD group did not.
   Because the human body is an inherently social stimulus, this result is
   consistent with social brain theories {[}e.g., Pelphrey \& Carter, 2008;
   Schultz, 2005] and suggests that the visual systems of individuals with
   ASD may not be tuned for the detection of socially relevant information
   such as the presence of another person. Reduced visual sensitivity to
   human movements could compromise important social behaviors including,
   for example, gesture comprehension.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how language emerged in our species calls for a detailed
   investigation of the initial specialization of the human brain for
   speech processing. Our earlier research demonstrated that an adult-like
   left-lateralized network of perisylvian areas is already active when
   infants listen to sentences in their native language, but did not
   address the issue of the specialization of this network for speech
   processing. Here we used fMRI to study the organization of brain
   activity in two-month-old infants when listening to speech or to music.
   We also explored how infants react to their mother's voice relative to
   an unknown voice. The results indicate that the well-known structural
   asymmetry already present in the infants' posterior temporal areas has a
   functional counterpart: there is a left-hemisphere advantage for speech
   relative to music at the level of the planum temporale. The posterior
   temporal regions are thus differently sensitive to the auditory
   environment very early on, channelling speech inputs preferentially to
   the left side. Furthermore, when listening to the mother's voice,
   activation was modulated in several areas, including areas involved in
   emotional processing (amygdala, orbito-frontal cortex), but also,
   crucially, a large extent of the left posterior temporal lobe,
   suggesting that the mother's voice plays a special role in the early
   shaping of posterior language areas. Both results underscore the joint
   contributions of genetic constraints and environmental inputs in the
   fast emergence of an efficient cortical network for language processing
   in humans. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Listening and reading comprehension of paragraph-length material are
   considered higher-order language skills fundamental to social and
   academic functioning. Using ecologically relevant language stimuli that
   were matched for difficulty according to developmental level, we analyze
   the effects of task, age, neuropsychological skills, and post-task
   performance on fMRI activation and hemispheric laterality. Areas of
   supramodal language processing are identified, with the most robust
   region being left-lateralized activation along the superior temporal
   sulcus. Functionally, this conjunction has a role in semantic and
   syntactic processing, leading us to refer to this conjunction as
   ``comprehension cortex.{''} Different from adults, supramodal areas for
   children include less extensive inferior frontal gyrus but more
   extensive right cerebellum and right temporal pole. Broader
   neuroanatomical pathways are recruited for reading, reflecting the more
   active processing and larger set of cognitive demands needed for reading
   compared to listening to stories. ROI analyses reveal that reading is a
   less lateralized language task than listening in inferior frontal and
   superior temporal areas, which likely reflects the difficulty of the
   task as children in this study are still developing their reading
   skills. For listening to stories, temporal activation is stable by age
   four with no correlations with age, neuropsychological skills or
   post-task performance. In contrast, frontal activation during listening
   to stories occurs more often in older children, and frontal activation
   is positively correlated with better performance on comprehension
   questions, suggesting that the activation of frontal networks may
   reflect greater integration and depth of story processing. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Haxby et al. (Haxby JV, Hoffman EA, Gobbini MI. 2000. The distributed
   human neural system for face perception. Trends Cogn Sci. 4:223-233.)
   proposed that eye gaze processing results from an interaction between a
   ``core{''} face-specific system involved in visual analysis and an
   ``extended{''} system involved in spatial attention, more generally.
   However, the full gaze perception network has remained poorly specified.
   In the context of a functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we used
   psychophysiological interactions (PPIs) to identify brain regions that
   showed differential connectivity (correlation) with core face perception
   structures (posterior superior temporal sulcus {[}pSTS] and fusiform
   gyrus {[}FG]) when viewing gaze shifts relative to control eye movements
   (opening/closing the eyes). The PPIs identified altered connectivity
   between the pSTS and MT/V5, intraparietal sulcus, frontal eye fields,
   superior temporal gyrus (STG), supramarginal gyrus, and middle frontal
   gyrus (MEG). The FG showed altered connectivity with the same areas of
   the STG and MFG, demonstrating the contribution of both dorsal and
   ventral core face areas to gaze perception. We propose that this network
   provides an interactive system that alerts us to seen changes in other
   agents' gaze direction, makes us aware of their altered focus of spatial
   attention, and prepares a corresponding shift in our own attention.}},

Abstract = {{Language in high-functioning autism is characterized by pragmatic and
   semantic deficits, and people with autism have a reduced tendency to
   integrate information. Because the left and right inferior frontal (LIE
   and RIF) regions are implicated with integration of speaker information,
   world knowledge, and semantic knowledge, we hypothesized that abnormal
   functioning of the LIF and RIF regions might contribute to pragmatic and
   semantic language deficits in autism. Brain activation of sixteen 12- to
   18-year-old, high-functioning autistic participants was measured with
   functional magnetic resonance imaging during sentence comprehension and
   compared with that of twenty-six matched controls. The content of the
   pragmatic sentence was congruent or incongruent with respect to the
   speaker characteristics (male/female, child/adult, and upper class/lower
   class). The semantic- and world-knowledge sentences were congruent or
   incongruent with respect to semantic expectancies and factual
   expectancies about the world, respectively. In the semantic-knowledge
   and world-knowledge condition, activation of the LIE region did not
   differ between groups. In sentences that required integration of speaker
   information, the autism group showed abnormally reduced activation of
   the LIF region. The results suggest that people with autism may recruit
   the LIE region in a different manner in tasks that demand integration of
   social information.}},

Abstract = {{Various brain regions contribute to aspects of attentional control in
   conflict resolution. Here, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation
   (TMS) to examine the functions of posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and
   dorsal medial frontal cortex (dMFC) in a visual flanker task.
   Participants responded to a central target that was flanked by
   congruent, neutral or incongruent stimuli on the left or right. Offline
   low-frequency repetitive TMS (1 Hz, 110\% motor threshold, 20 min) was
   applied to right PPC or dMFC. Performance, as measured by reaction times
   and accuracy, was established at baseline, after rTMS, and sham
   stimulation before or after active rTMS. After rTMS to right PPC, the
   interference of flankers presented in the left visual hemispace
   diminished selectively. By contrast, after rTMS over the right dMFC,
   flanker effects in both visual fields remained. Our results suggest that
   right PPC specifically contributes to the assignment of spatial
   attention during stimulus encoding.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescents are often sensitive to peer rejection, a factor that might
   contribute to the risk of affective disorder in this age group. Previous
   studies suggest a significant overlap among socioaffective brain regions
   involved in the response to social rejection, regions continuing to
   develop functionally during adolescence and regions influenced by
   monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) polymorphism. The current study investigated
   whether the neural response to social rejection is functionally immature
   in adolescents compared with adults, and whether these responses are
   modulated by MAOA genotype. Blood-oxygen-level-dependent response was
   measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging during a
   rejection-themed emotional Stroop task in 19 adolescents (aged 14-16)
   and 16 adults (aged 23-28) genotyped for MAOA polymorphism. Similar
   numbers of MAOA-L and MAOA-H carriers were recruited to maximize power
   to detect genotype effects. Main effects of rejection stimuli (relative
   to neutral and acceptance control stimuli) were seen in predicted
   socioaffective brain regions. Adolescents did not show the adult pattern
   of modulation by rejection stimuli in the right ventrolateral prefrontal
   cortex, suggesting continued functional maturation of this regulatory
   region during adolescence. Age and genotype interacted in the left
   amygdala, in which the predicted effect of genotype on responses to
   rejection stimuli was seen in the adults, but not in the adolescents.
   The data suggest continued functional development of the circuitry
   underlying the processing of social rejection between adolescence and
   adulthood, and show that the effects of MAOA genotype on neural
   responses may vary with age.}},

Abstract = {{Activity within the default-mode network (DMN) is thought to be related
   to self-referential processing, such as thinking about one's preferences
   or personality traits. Although the DMN is generally considered to
   function as a network, evidence is starting to accumulate that suggests
   that areas of the DMN are each specialized for different subfunctions of
   self-referential processing. Here, we address the issue of functional
   specialization by investigating changes in coupling between areas of the
   DMN during self-referential processing. To this aim, brain activity was
   assessed during a task in which subjects had to indicate whether a trait
   adjective described their own personality (self-referential, Self
   condition), that of another person (other-referential, Other condition),
   or whether the trait was socially desirable (nonreferential, Control
   condition). To exclude confounding effects of cardiorespiratory
   processes on activity and functional coupling, we corrected the fMRI
   signal for these effects. Activity within areas of the DMN was found to
   be modulated by self-referential processing. More specifically, during
   the Self condition compared to the Other and Control condition, activity
   within the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, ventral medial prefrontal
   cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex was increased. Moreover, coupling
   between areas of the DMN was reduced during the Self condition compared
   to the Other and Control condition, while coupling between regions of
   the DMN and regions outside the network was increased. As such, these
   results provide an indication for functional specialization within the
   DMN and support the notion that each area of the DMN is involved in
   different subfunctions of self-referential processing. Hum Brain Mapp

Abstract = {{Episodic future thinking allows humans to mentally simulate virtually
   infinite future possibilities, yet this device is fundamentally
   goal-directed and should not be equated with fantasizing or wishful
   thinking. The purpose of this fMRI study was to investigate the neural
   basis of such goal-directed processing during future-event simulation.
   Participants were scanned while they imagined future events that were
   related to their personal goals (personal future events) and future
   events that were plausible but unrelated to their personal goals
   (nonpersonal future events). Results showed that imaging personal future
   events elicited stronger activation in ventral medial prefrontal cortex
   (MPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) compared to imaging
   nonpersonal future events. Moreover, these brain activations overlapped
   with activations elicited by a second task that assessed semantic
   self-knowledge (i.e., making judgments on one's own personality traits),
   suggesting that ventral MPFC and PCC mediate self-referential processing
   across different functional domains. It is suggested that these brain
   regions may support a collection of processes that evaluate, code, and
   contextualize the relevance of mental representations with regard to
   personal goals. The implications of these findings for the understanding

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Face perception serves as the basis for much of human social exchange.
   Diverse information can be extracted about an individual from a single
   glance at their face, including their identity, emotional state, and
   direction of attention. Neuropsychological and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments reveal a complex network of
   specialized areas in the human brain supporting these face-reading
   skills. Here we consider the evolutionary roots of human face perception
   by exploring the manner in which different animal species view and
   respond to faces. We focus on behavioral experiments collected from both
   primates and nonprimates, assessing the types of information that
   animals are able to extract from the faces of their conspecifics, human
   experimenters, and natural predators. These experiments reveal that
   faces are an important category of visual stimuli for animals in all
   major vertebrate taxa, possibly reflecting the early emergence of neural
   specialization for faces in vertebrate evolution. At the same time, some
   aspects of facial perception are only evident in primates and a few
   other social mammals, and may therefore have evolved to suit the needs
   of complex social communication. Because the human brain likely utilizes
   both primitive and recently evolved neural specializations for the
   processing of faces, comparative studies may hold the key to
   understanding how these parallel circuits emerged during human
   evolution.}},

   Surface-based information mapping reveals crossmodal vision-action

   10.1152/jn.00326.2010. Many lines of evidence point to a tight linkage
   between the perceptual and motoric representations of actions. Numerous
   demonstrations show how the visual perception of an action engages
   compatible activity in the observer's motor system. This is seen for
   both intransitive actions (e. g., in the case of unconscious postural
   imitation) and transitive actions (e. g., grasping an object). Although
   the discovery of ``mirror neurons{''} in macaques has inspired
   explanations of these processes in human action behaviors, the evidence
   for areas in the human brain that similarly form a crossmodal
   visual/motor representation of actions remains incomplete. To address
   this, in the present study, participants performed and observed hand
   actions while being scanned with functional MRI. We took a data-driven
   approach by applying whole-brain information mapping using a multivoxel
   pattern analysis (MVPA) classifier, performed on reconstructed
   representations of the cortical surface. The aim was to identify regions
   in which local voxelwise patterns of activity can distinguish among
   different actions, across the visual and motor domains. Experiment 1
   tested intransitive, meaningless hand movements, whereas experiment 2
   tested object-directed actions (all right-handed). Our analyses of both
   experiments revealed crossmodal action regions in the lateral
   occipitotemporal cortex (bilaterally) and in the left postcentral
   gyrus/anterior parietal cortex. Furthermore, in experiment 2 we
   identified a gradient of bias in the patterns of information in the left
   hemisphere postcentral/parietal region. The postcentral gyrus carried
   more information about the effectors used to carry out the action
   (fingers vs. whole hand), whereas anterior parietal regions carried more
   information about the goal of the action (lift vs. punch). Taken
   together, these results provide evidence for common neural coding in
   these areas of the visual and motor aspects of actions, and demonstrate

Abstract = {{Functional and structural maturation of networks comprised of discrete
   regions is an important aspect of brain development The default-mode
   network (DMN) is a prominent network which includes the posterior
   cingulate cortex (PCC). medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), medial temporal
   lobes (MTL). and angular gyrus (AG) Despite increasing interest in DMN
   function, little is known about its maturation from childhood to
   adulthood Here we examine developmental changes in DMN connectivity
   using a multimodal imaging approach by combining resting-state fMRI,
   voxel-based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging-based tractography
   We found that the DMN undergoes significant developmental changes in
   functional and structural connectivity, but these changes are not
   uniform across all DMN nodes Convergent structural and functional
   connectivity analyses suggest that PCC-mPFC connectivity along the
   cingulum bundle is the most immature link in the DMN of children Both
   PCC and mPFC also showed gray matter volume differences, as well as
   prominent macrostructural and microstructural differences in the dorsal
   cingulum bundle linking these regions Notably, structural connectivity
   between PCC and left MTL was either weak or non-existent in children,
   even though functional connectivity did not differ from that of adults
   These results imply that functional connectivity in children can reach
   adult-like levels despite weak structural connectivity. We propose that
   maturation of PCC-mPFC structural connectivity plays an important role
   in the development of self-related and social-cognitive functions that
   emerge during adolescence. More generally, our study demonstrates how
   quantitative multimodal analysis of anatomy and connectivity allows us
   to better characterize the heterogeneous development and maturation of
   brain networks (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have identified the critical role of the left fusiform
   cortex in visual word form processing, learning, and memory. However,
   this so-called visual word form area's (VWFA) other functions are not
   clear In this study, we used fMRI and the subsequent memory paradigm to
   examine whether the putative VWFA was involved in the processing and
   successful memory encoding of faces as well as words Twenty-two native
   Chinese speakers were recruited to memorize the visual forms of faces
   and Chinese words Episodic memory for the studied material was tested 3
   h after the scan with a recognition test The fusiform face area (FFA)
   and the VWFA were functionally defined using separate localizer tasks We
   found that, both within and across subjects, stronger activity in the
   VWFA was associated with better recognition memory of both words and
   faces Furthermore, activation in the VWFA did not differ significantly
   during the encoding of faces and words Our results revealed the
   important role of the so-called VWFA in face processing and memory and
   supported the view that the left mid-fusiform cortex plays a general

Abstract = {{Behavioural studies suggest that the processing of movement stimuli is
   influenced by beliefs about the agency behind these actions The current
   study examined how activity in social and action related brain areas
   differs when participants were instructed that identical movement
   stimuli were either human or computer generated. Participants viewed a
   series of point-light animation figures derived from motion-capture
   recordings of a moving actor, while functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) was used to monitor patterns of neural activity The
   stimuli were scrambled to produce a range of stimulus realism
   categories, furthermore, before each trial participants were told that
   they were about to view either a recording of human movement or a
   computer-simulated pattern of movement Behavioural results suggested
   that agency instructions influenced participants' perceptions of the
   stimuli The fMRI analysis indicated different functions within the
   paracingulate cortex. ventral paracingulate cortex was more active for
   human compared to computer agency instructed trials across all stimulus
   types, whereas dorsal paracingulate cortex was activated more highly in
   conflicting conditions (human instruction, low realism or vice versa)
   These findings support the hypothesis that ventral paracingulate encodes
   stimuli deemed to be of human origin, whereas dorsal paracingulate
   cortex is involved more in the ascertainment of human or intentional
   agency during the observation of ambiguous stimuli Our results highlight
   the importance of prior instructions or beliefs on movement processing

Abstract = {{Previous functional neuroimaging studies have uncovered partly separable
   neural substrates for perceiving different facial expressions presented
   below the level of conscious awareness However, as one of the six basic
   emotions, the neural mechanism of unconsciously perceiving surprised
   faces has not yet been investigated Using a backward masking procedure,
   we studied the neural activities in response to surprised faces
   presented below the threshold of conscious visual perception by means of
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Eighteen healthy adults
   were scanned while viewing surprised faces, which presented for 33 ms
   and immediately ``masked{''} by a neutral face for 467 ms. As a control,
   they viewed masked happy or neutral faces as well In comparison to both
   control conditions, masked surprised faces yielded significantly greater
   activation in the parahippocampal gyms and fusiform gyrus, which
   associated previously with novelty detection In the present study,
   automatic activation of these areas to masked surprised faces was
   investigated as a function of individual differences in the ability of
   identifying and differentiating one's emotions, as assessed by the
   20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). The correlation results
   showed that, the subscale, Difficulty Identifying Feelings, was
   negatively correlated with the neural response of these areas to masked
   surprised faces, which suggest that decreased activation magnitude in
   specific brain regions may reflect increased difficulties in recognizing
   one's emotions in everyday life. Additionally, we confirmed activation
   of the right amygdala and right thalamus to the masked surprised faces,
   which was previously proved to be involved in the unconscious emotional
   perception system (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{Body dissatisfaction is an important precipitating and maintenance
   factor in anorexia nervosa (AN) and behavioral studies suggest that a
   cognitive-affective component and a perceptual component ( perceptual
   disturbance of one's own body) are both important in this
   pathophysiology. However, the functional neuroanatomy of body
   dissatisfaction in AN is largely unknown. This study has investigated
   self-other body-shape comparison to establish neural correlates of body
   dissatisfaction in patients with AN. 17 women with AN and 18 age and
   sex-matched healthy control (HC) subjects were scanned using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging while comparing themselves with images of
   slim idealized female bodies (active condition) or viewing images of
   interior home designs (control condition). Participants were asked to
   compare their body shape or room design with those presented. Patients
   with AN (in comparison to the HC group) showed greater anxiety to the
   self-other body-shape comparison, and they were less satisfied with
   their current body shape. In the patient group (in comparison to the HC
   group) the self-other body-shape comparison induced more activation of
   the right sensorimotor brain regions (insula, premotor cortex) and less
   activation of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Insula
   hyperactivation along with ACC hypoactivation may be critical for
   altered interoceptive awareness to body self-comparison and/or for
   altered implicit motivation to thin-idealized body images in AN

Abstract = {{Introduction: Persons diagnosed with schizophrenia demonstrate deficits
   in prosody recognition. To examine prosody along the schizophrenia
   spectrum, antipsychotic-naive schizotypa I personality disorder (SPD)
   subjects and healthy control subjects were compared. It was hypothesized
   that SPD subjects would perform more poorly: with cognitive and
   demographic factors contributing to the poor performance. The superior
   temporal gyrus (STG) was selected as the region-of-interest (ROI) given
   its known abnormalities in SPD and its important role in the processing
   of prosody.
   Methods: SPD and healthy comparison (HC) subjects were matched on age,
   IQ and parental social-economic status (PSES). Cognitive measures
   included the Speech Sound Perception Test (SSPT) to examine phonological
   processing (SPD = 68, HC = 74) and the Verbal Fluency task to examine
   executive functioning (SPD = 129, HC = 138). The main experiment was a
   novel fMRI task of prosody identification using semantically neutral
   sentences spoken with emotional prosody (SPD = 16, HC=13). Finally,
   volumetric measurement of the superior temporal sulcus (STS), a key
   region for processing prosody, and partially overlapping with the STG,
   was performed (SPD=30, HC=30).
   Results: Phonological processing and executive functioning were both
   impaired in SPD subjects compared with HC subjects. Contrary to the
   prediction, SPD subjects, as a group, were similar to HC subjects in
   terms of correctly indentifying the emotion conveyed and reaction time.
   Within the SPD group, prosody identification accuracy was influenced by
   executive functioning, IQ and perhaps PSES, relationships not found with
   HC subjects. Phonological perception aided prosody identification in
   both diagnostic groups. As expected, both groups activated the STG while
   performing the prosody identification task. However, SPD subjects may
   have been less ``efficient{''} in their recruitment of STG neurons.
   Finally, SPD subjects demonstrated a trend toward smaller STS volumes on
   the left, particularly the lower bank.
   Conclusions: These data suggest that subtle differences between SPD and
   controls in phonological processing, executive functioning, IQ and
   possibly PSES, contributed to difficulty in processing prosody for some
   SPD subjects. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the impact of focal brain lesions on causal
   reasoning about everyday events that led to adverse outcomes.
   Participants with focal lesions involving frontal and posterior brain
   regions and matched healthy control participants were compared in their
   causal inference judgments about intentional human actions,
   unintentional human actions and physical events. Compared to the control
   group, those with frontal lesions, especially to right-sided
   ventromedial and lateral regions, differentiated less between
   intentional and unintentional acts. Imaging studies have implicated
   ventromedial frontal regions in the processing of social and emotional
   material, while lateral frontal regions have been linked to abstract
   reasoning and executive control. Difficulties in both social/emotional
   processing and in abstract reasoning and executive control may impair
   sensitivity to intentionality when making causal inferences.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The interpretation of non-verbal social signals relies
   heavily on the ability to perceive biological motion. The posterior
   superior temporal sulcus is an important part of a network involved in
   biological motion processing. However, the underlying functional
   organization remains poorly understood. Several studies have suggested
   topographical representation of motion from different body parts within
   this region. However, other studies have shown that the posterior
   superior temporal sulcus responds equally to any body part.
   OBJECTIVE: Through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging, the
   effects of socially relevant biological motion stimuli to activate a
   specific cortical area within posterior superior temporal sulcus, even
   if different body parts are involved in motion, will be analyzed.
   DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: A functional magnetic resonance imaging,
   block-design was performed at the Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Surgical
   Medical Investigation Center, Havana, Cuba between 2004 and 2005.
   PARTICIPANTS: Thirteen healthy volunteers, from 19 to 55 years of age
   and comprising eight males and five females, were included in the study.
   METHODS: A conjunction analysis of responses to natural, dynamic,
   fearful, facial expressions and point-light, body-motion animations.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The corresponding functionally specialized areas,
   as well as neural areas significant for both types of stimuli, were
   identified.
   RESULTS: One region within the posterior superior temporal sulcus of the
   right hemisphere was equally activated by facial and body complex
   motion.
   CONCLUSION: A site of common neural activity existed within the
   posterior superior temporal sulcus, which was not specific to a
   biological motion type. In addition, the activity was not related to a
   topographically organized body-part map, which suggested high-level
   visual representation of biological motion in this region.}},

Abstract = {{Basic emotional states (such as anger, fear, and joy) can be similarly
   conveyed by the face, the body, and the voice. Are there human brain
   regions that represent these emotional mental states regardless of the
   sensory cues from which they are perceived? To address this question, in
   the present study participants evaluated the intensity of emotions
   perceived from face movements, body movements, or vocal intonations,
   while their brain activity was measured with functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI). Using multivoxel pattern analysis, we compared
   the similarity of response patterns across modalities to test for brain
   regions in which emotion-specific patterns in one modality (e. g.,
   faces) could predict emotion-specific patterns in another modality (e.
   g., bodies). A whole-brain searchlight analysis revealed
   modality-independent but emotion category-specific activity patterns in
   medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and left superior temporal sulcus (STS).
   Multivoxel patterns in these regions contained information about the
   category of the perceived emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness,
   sadness) across all modality comparisons (face-body, face-voice,
   body-voice), and independently of the perceived intensity of the
   emotions. No systematic emotion-related differences were observed in the
   overall amplitude of activation in MPFC or STS. These results reveal
   supramodal representations of emotions in high-level brain areas
   previously implicated in affective processing, mental state attribution,
   and theory-of-mind. We suggest that MPFC and STS represent perceived
   emotions at an abstract, modality-independent level, and thus play a key
   role in the understanding and categorization of others' emotional mental
   states.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The humanoid robot WE4-RII was designed to express human
   emotions in order to improve human-robot interaction. We can read the
   emotions depicted in its gestures, yet might utilize different neural
   processes than those used for reading the emotions in human agents.
   Methodology: Here, fMRI was used to assess how brain areas activated by
   the perception of human basic emotions (facial expression of Anger, Joy,
   Disgust) and silent speech respond to a humanoid robot impersonating the
   same emotions, while participants were instructed to attend either to
   the emotion or to the motion depicted.
   Principal Findings: Increased responses to robot compared to human
   stimuli in the occipital and posterior temporal cortices suggest
   additional visual processing when perceiving a mechanical
   anthropomorphic agent. In contrast, activity in cortical areas endowed
   with mirror properties, like left Broca's area for the perception of
   speech, and in the processing of emotions like the left anterior insula
   for the perception of disgust and the orbitofrontal cortex for the
   perception of anger, is reduced for robot stimuli, suggesting lesser
   resonance with the mechanical agent. Finally, instructions to explicitly
   attend to the emotion significantly increased response to robot, but not
   human facial expressions in the anterior part of the left inferior
   frontal gyrus, a neural marker of motor resonance.
   Conclusions: Motor resonance towards a humanoid robot, but not a human,
   display of facial emotion is increased when attention is directed
   towards judging emotions.
   Significance: Artificial agents can be used to assess how factors like
   anthropomorphism affect neural response to the perception of human
   actions.}},

Abstract = {{Brain reward circuitry, including ventral striatum and orbitofrontal
   cortex, has been independently implicated in preferences for fair and
   cooperative outcomes as well as learning of reputations. Using
   functional MRI (fMRI) and a ``trust game{''} task involving iterative
   exchanges with fictive partners who acquire different reputations for
   reciprocity, we measured brain responses in 36 healthy adults when
   positive actions (entrust investment to partners) yield positive returns
   (reciprocity) and how these brain responses are modulated by partner
   reputation for repayment. Here we show that positive reciprocity
   robustly engages the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex.
   Moreover, this signal of reciprocity in the ventral striatum appears
   selectively in response to partners who have consistently returned the
   investment (e.g., a reputation for reciprocity) and is absent for
   partners who lack a reputation for reciprocity. These findings elucidate
   a fundamental brain mechanism, via reward-related neural substrates, by
   which human cooperative relationships are initiated and sustained.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the function of a tool is an essential step in learning to
   use a tool. This aspect of interaction with tools has hitherto been
   neglected. Unlike acquiring the expertise in handling a new tool, which
   involves practice, understanding its function usually only requires a
   single observation of the tool being used. The present study uncovers
   the neural areas involved in this transient understanding effect as a
   left-lateralized pattern involving prefrontal and mediotemporal areas.
   We suggest that activation in this network reflects the conceptual
   encoding of the function of new tools as it is independent from the
   well-known tool-related networks. We demonstrate that understanding the
   function of a new tool does not rely on known semantic or motor networks
   involved in processing tool use. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{A central evolutionary challenge for social groups is uniting a
   heterogeneous set of individuals towards common goals. One means by
   which social groups form and endure is by endowing group members with
   extraordinary prosocial proclivities, such as ingroup love, towards
   other group members. Here we examined the neural basis of extraordinary
   empathy and altruistic motivation in African-American and
   Caucasian-American individuals using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging. Our results indicate that empathy for ingroup members is
   neurally distinct from empathy for humankind, more generally. People
   showed greater response within anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral
   insula when observing the suffering of others, but African-American
   individuals additionally recruit medial prefrontal cortex when observing
   the suffering of members of their own social group. Moreover, neural
   activity within medial prefrontal cortex in response to pain expressed
   by ingroup relative to outgroup members predicted greater empathy and
   altruistic motivation for one's ingroup, suggesting that neurocognitive
   processes associated with self identity underlie extraordinary empathy
   and altruistic motivation for members of one's own social group. Taken
   together, our findings reveal distinct neural mechanisms of empathy and
   altruistic motivation in an intergroup context and may serve as a
   foundation for future research investigating the neural bases of
   intergroup prosociality, more broadly construed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Favors from a sender to a receiver are known to bias decisions made by
   the recipient, especially when the decision relates to the sender, a
   feature of social exchange known as reciprocity. Using an art-viewing
   paradigm possessing no objectively correct answer for preferring one
   piece of art over another, we show that sponsorship of the experiment by
   a company endows the logo of the company with the capacity to bias
   revealed preference for art displayed next to the logo. Merely offering
   to sponsor the experiment similarly endowed the gesturing logo of the
   company with the capacity to bias revealed preferences. These effects do
   not depend upon the size of the displayed art or the proximity of the
   sponsoring logo to the piece of art. We used functional magnetic
   resonance imaging to show that such monetary favors do not modulate a
   special collection of brain responses but instead modulate responses in
   neural networks normally activated by a wide range of preference
   judgments. The results raise the important possibility that monetary
   favors bias judgments in domains seemingly unrelated to the favor but
   nevertheless act in an implicit way through neural networks that
   underlie normal, ongoing preference judgments.}},

Abstract = {{Previous evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   studies has shown that amygdala responses to emotionally neutral

   that amygdala responses are elevated not only in response to negative
   pictures but also to neutral pictures as a function of disease severity
   in patients with mild symptoms and in subjects who did not develop
   symptoms. To this end, fMRI scans were performed in 10 patients with
   mild PTSD and 10 healthy controls (both victims of a bank robbery),
   during the execution of a visuo-attentional task in which they were
   asked to observe emotionally negative or neutral pictures. Control
   subjects showed enhanced amygdala responses to emotionally negative
   stimuli compared to neutral stimuli. On the contrary, PTSD patients were
   characterized by high amygdala responses to both neutral and emotional
   pictures, with no statistically significant difference between the two
   classes of stimuli. In the entire group, we found correlations among the
   severity of the PTSD symptoms, task performance, and amygdala activation
   during the processing of neutral stimuli. Results of this study suggest
   that amygdala responses and the selectivity of the emotional response to
   neutral stimuli are elevated as a function of disease severity in PTSD
   patients with mild symptoms. (C) 2010 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{The Integration of Prosodic Speech in High Functioning Autism: A
   Preliminary fMRI Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a
   specific triad of symptoms such as abnormalities in social interaction,
   abnormalities in communication and restricted activities and interests.
   While verbal autistic subjects may present a correct mastery of the
   formal aspects of speech, they have difficulties in prosody (music of
   speech), leading to communication disorders. Few behavioural studies
   have revealed a prosodic impairment in children with autism, and among
   the few fMRI studies aiming at assessing the neural network involved in
   language, none has specifically studied prosodic speech. The aim of the
   present study was to characterize specific prosodic components such as
   linguistic prosody (intonation, rhythm and emphasis) and emotional
   prosody and to correlate them with the neural network underlying them.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We used a behavioural test (Profiling
   Elements of the Prosodic System, PEPS) and fMRI to characterize prosodic
   deficits and investigate the neural network underlying prosodic
   processing. Results revealed the existence of a link between perceptive
   and productive prosodic deficits for some prosodic components (rhythm,
   emphasis and affect) in HFA and also revealed that the neural network
   involved in prosodic speech perception exhibits abnormal activation in
   the left SMG as compared to controls (activation positively correlated
   with intonation and emphasis) and an absence of deactivation patterns in
   regions involved in the default mode.
   Conclusions/Significance: These prosodic impairments could not only
   result from activation patterns abnormalities but also from an inability
   to adequately use the strategy of the default network inhibition, both
   mechanisms that have to be considered for decreasing task performance in
   High Functioning Autism.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL 7}},
Abstract = {{Behavioral evidence indicates that angry faces are seen as more
   threatening, and elicit greater anxiety, when directed at the observer,
   whereas the influence of gaze on the processing of fearful faces is less
   consistent. Recent research has also found inconsistent effects of
   expression and gaze direction on the amygdala response to facial signals
   of threat. However, such studies have failed to consider the important
   influence of anxiety on the response to signals of threat; an influence
   that is well established in behavioral research and recent neuroimaging
   studies. Here, we investigated the way in which individual differences
   in anxiety would influence the interactive effect of gaze and expression
   on the response to angry and fearful faces in the human extended
   amygdala. Participants viewed images of fearful, angry and neutral
   faces, either displaying an averted or direct gaze. We found that state
   anxiety predicted an increased response in the dorsal
   amygdala/substantia innominata (SI) to angry faces when gazing at,
   relative to away from the observer. By contrast, high state anxious
   individuals showed an increased amygdala response to fearful faces that
   was less dependent on gaze. In addition, the relationship between state
   anxiety and gaze on emotional intensity ratings mirrored the
   relationship between anxiety and the amygdala/SI response. These results
   have implications for understanding the functional role of the amygdala
   and extended amygdala in processing signals of threat, and are
   consistent with the proposed role of this region in coding the relevance
   or significance of a stimulus to the observer.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Exaggerated amygdala activation to threatening faces has
   been detected in adults and children with anxiety disorders, compared to
   healthy comparison (HC) subjects. However, the profile of amygdala
   activation in response to facial expressions in obsessive-compulsive
   disorder (OLD,) may be a distinguishing feature; a prior study found
   that compared with healthy adults, adults with OCD exhibited less
   amygdala activation to emotional and neutral faces, relative to fixation
   {[}Cannistraro et al. (2004). Biological Psychiatry 56:916-920].
   Methods: In the current event-related functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) study, a pediatric OCD sample (N = 12) and a HC sample (N
   = 17) performed a gender discrimination task while viewing emotional
   faces (happy, fearful, disgusted) and neutral faces. Results: Compared
   to the HC group, the OCD group showed less amygdala/hippocampus
   activation in all emotion and neutral conditions relative to fixation.
   Conclusions: Like previous reports in adult OCD, pediatric OCD may have
   a distinct neural profile from other anxiety disorders, with respect to
   amygdala activation in response to emotional stimuli that are not
   disorder specific. Depression and Anxiety 27:643-651, 2010. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Worldwide, ethanol abuse causes thousands of fatal accidents annually as
   well as innumerable social dysfunctions and severe medical disorders.
   Yet, few studies have used the blood oxygenation level dependent
   functional magnetic resonance imaging method (BOLD fMRI) to map how
   alcohol alters brain functions, as fMRI relies on neurovascular
   coupling, which may change due to the vasoactive properties of alcohol.
   We monitored the hemodynamic response function (HRF) with a high
   temporal resolution. In both motor cortices and the visual cortex,
   alcohol prolonged the time course of the HRF, indicating an overall
   slow-down of neurovascular coupling rather than an isolated reduction in
   neuronal activity. However, in the supplementary motor area,
   alcohol-induced changes to the HRF suggest a reduced neuronal
   activation. This may explain why initiating and coordinating complex
   movements, including speech production, are often impaired earlier than
   executing basic motor patterns. Furthermore, the present study revealed
   a potential pitfall associated with the statistical interpretation of
   pharmacological fMRI studies based on the general linear model: if the
   functional form of the HRF is changed between the conditions data may be
   erroneously interpreted as increased or decreased neuronal activation.
   Thus, our study not only presents an additional key to how alcohol
   affects the network of brain functions but also implies that potential
   changes to neurovascular coupling have to be taken into account when
   interpreting BOLD fMRI. Therefore, measuring individual drug-induced HRF
   changes is recommended for pharmacological fMRI.}},

Title = {{Are functional deficits in concussed individuals consistent with white

Abstract = {{There is still controversy in the literature whether a single episode of
   mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) results in short-term functional
   and/or structural deficits as well as any induced long-term residual
   effects. With the inability of traditional structural brain imaging
   techniques to accurately diagnosis MTBI, there is hope that more
   advanced applications like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) will be more specific in diagnosing
   MTBI. In this study, 15 subjects who have recently suffered from
   sport-related MTBI and 15 age-matched normal controls underwent both
   fMRI and DTI to investigate the possibility of traumatic axonal injury
   associated with functional deficits in recently concussed but
   asymptomatic individuals. There are several findings of interest. First,
   MTBI subjects had a more disperse brain activation pattern with
   additional increases in activity outside of the shared regions of
   interest (ROIs) as revealed by FMRI blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD)
   signals. The MTBI group had additional activation in the left
   dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex during encoding phase of spatial
   navigation working memory task that was not observed in normal controls.
   Second, neither whole-brain analysis nor ROI analysis showed significant
   alteration of white matter (WM) integrity in MTBI subjects as evidenced
   by fractional anisotropy FA (DTI) data. It should be noted, however,
   there was a larger variability of fractional anisotropy (FA) in the
   genu, and body of the corpus callosum in MTB subjects. Moreover, we
   observed decreased diffusivity as evidenced by apparent diffusion
   coefficient (ADC) at both left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   (DL-PFC) in MTBI subjects (P < 0.001). There was also a positive
   correlation (P < 0.05) between ADC and \% change of fMRI BOLD signals at
   DL-PFC in MTBI subjects, but not in normal controls. Despite these
   differences we conclude that overall, no consistent findings across
   advanced brain imaging techniques (fMRI and DTI) were observed. Whether
   the lack of consistency across research techniques (fMRI \& DTI) is due
   to time frame of scanning, unique nature of MTBI and/or technological
   issues involved in FA and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC)
   quantification is yet to be determined.}},

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{397-407}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Social interaction and comprehension of non-verbal behaviour requires a
   representation of people's bodies. Research into the neural
   underpinnings of body representation implicates several brain regions
   including extrastriate and fusiform body areas (EBA and FBA), superior
   temporal sulcus (STS), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and inferior
   parietal lobule (IPL). The different roles played by these regions in
   parsing familiar and unfamiliar body postures remain unclear. We
   examined the responses of this body observation network to static images
   of ordinary and contorted postures by using a repetition suppression
   design in functional neuroimaging. Participants were scanned whilst
   observing static images of a contortionist or a group of objects in
   either ordinary or unusual configurations, presented from different
   viewpoints. Greater activity emerged in EBA and FBA when participants
   viewed contorted compared to ordinary body postures. Repeated
   presentation of the same posture from different viewpoints lead to
   suppressed responses in the fusiform gyrus as well as three regions that
   are characteristically activated by observing moving bodies, namely STS,
   IFG and IPL. These four regions did not distinguish the image viewpoint
   or the plausibility of the posture. Together, these data define a broad
   cortical network for processing static body postures, including regions
   classically associated with action observation.}},

Abstract = {{Neuromarketing has recently generated controversies concerning the
   involvement of medical professionals, and many key questions remain-ones
   that have potentially important implications for the field of
   psychiatry. Conflicting definitions of neuromarketing have been
   proposed, and little is known about the actual practices of companies,
   physicians, and scientists involved in its practice. This article
   reviews the history of neuromarketing and uses an exploratory survey of
   neuromarketing Web sites to illustrate ethical issues raised by this new
   field. Neuromarketing, as currently practiced, is heterogeneous, as
   companies are offering a variety of technologies. Many companies employ
   academicians and professionals, but few list their clients or fees.
   Media coverage of neuromarketing appears disproportionately high
   compared to the paucity of peer-reviewed reports in the field. Companies
   may be making premature claims about the power of neuroscience to
   predict consumer behavior. Overall, neuromarketing has important
   implications for academic-industrial partnerships, the responsible
   conduct of research, and the public understanding of the brain. We
   explore these themes to uncover issues relevant to professional ethics,
   research, and policy. Of particular relevance to psychiatry,
   neuromarketing may be seen as an extension of the search for
   quantification and certainty in previously indefinite aspects of human
   behavior. (HARV REV PSYCHIATRY 2010;18:230-237.)}},

Abstract = {{Multimodal integration of nonverbal social signals is essential for
   successful social interaction. Previous studies have implicated the
   posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) in the perception of social
   signals such as nonverbal emotional signals as well as in social
   cognitive functions like mentalizing/theory of mind. In the present
   study, we evaluated the relationships between trait emotional
   intelligence (El) and fMRI activation patterns in individual subjects
   during the multimodal perception of nonverbal emotional signals from
   voice and face. Trait El was linked to hemodynamic responses in the
   right pSTS, an area which also exhibits a distinct sensitivity to human
   voices and faces. Within all other regions known to subserve the
   perceptual audiovisual integration of human social signals (i.e.,
   amygdala, fusiform gyms, thalamus), no such linked responses were
   observed. This functional difference in the network for the audiovisual
   perception of human social signals indicates a specific contribution of
   the pSTS as a possible interface between the perception of social
   information and social cognition. Hum Brain Mapp 31:979-991, 2010. (C)

Abstract = {{Although many examples exist for shared neural representations of self
   and other, it is unknown how such shared representations interact with
   the rest of the brain. Furthermore, do high-level inference-based shared
   mentalizing representations interact with lower level
   embodied/simulation-based shared representations? We used functional
   neuroimaging (fMRI) and a functional connectivity approach to assess
   these questions during high-level inference-based mentalizing. Shared
   mentalizing representations in ventromedial prefrontal cortex, posterior
   cingulate/precuneus, and temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) all exhibited
   identical functional connectivity patterns during mentalizing of both
   self and other. Connectivity patterns were distributed across low-level
   embodied neural systems such as the frontal operculum/ventral premotor
   cortex, the anterior insula, the primary sensorimotor cortex, and the
   presupplementary motor area. These results demonstrate that identical
   neural circuits are implementing processes involved in mentalizing of
   both self and other and that the nature of such processes may be the
   integration of low-level embodied processes within higher level
   inference-based mentalizing.}},

   Understanding actions of conspecifics is a fundamental social ability
   depending largely on the activation of a parieto-frontal network. Using
   functional MRI (fMRI), we studied how goal-directed movements (i.e.,
   motor acts) performed by others are coded within this network. In the
   first experiment, we presented volunteers with video clips showing four
   different motor acts (dragging, dropping, grasping, and pushing)
   performed with different effectors (foot, hand, and mouth). We found
   that the coding of observed motor acts differed between premotor and
   parietal cortex. In the premotor cortex, they clustered according to the
   effector used, and in the inferior parietal lobule (IPL), they clustered
   according to the type of the observed motor act, regardless of the
   effector. Two subsequent experiments in which we directly contrasted
   these four motor acts indicated that, in IPL, the observed motor acts
   are coded according to the relationship between agent and object:
   Movements bringing the object toward the agent (grasping and dragging)
   activate a site corresponding approximately to the ventral part of the
   putative human AIP (phAIP), whereas movements moving the object away
   from the agent (pushing and dropping) are clustered dorsally within this
   area. These data provide indications that the phAIP region plays a role
   in categorizing motor acts according to their behavioral significance.
   In addition, our results suggest that in the case of motor acts
   typically done with the hand, the representations of such acts in phAIP
   are used as templates for coding motor acts executed with other
   effectors.}},

Abstract = {{By age 2, children attribute referential mental states such as
   perceptions and emotions to themselves and others, yet it is not until
   age 4 that they attribute representational mental states such as
   beliefs. This raises an interesting question: is attribution of beliefs
   different from attribution of perceptions and emotions in terms of its
   neural substrate? To address this question with a high degree of
   anatomic specificity, we partitioned the TPJ, a broad area often found
   to be recruited in theory of mind tasks, into 2 neuroanatomically
   specific regions of interest: Superior Temporal Sulcus (STS) and
   Inferior Parietal Lobule (IPL). To maximize behavioral specificity, we
   designed a tightly controlled verbal task comprised of sets of single
   sentences - sentences identical except for the type of mental state
   specified in the verb (belief, emotion, perception, syntax control).
   Results indicated that attribution of beliefs more strongly recruited
   both regions of interest than did emotions or perceptions. This is
   especially surprising with respect to STS, since it is widely reported
   in the literature to mediate the detection of referential states among
   them emotions and perceptions - rather than the inference of beliefs. An
   explanation is offered that focuses on the differences between verbal
   stimuli and visual stimuli, and between a process of sentence
   comprehension and a process of visual detection. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Theory of Mind - ToM, the capacity to understand one's own and other
   people's mental states and to refer to them to foresee and explain the
   behaviour - relies upon a circumscribed neural system: the posterior end
   of the superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), the adjacent temporo-parietal
   junction (TPJ), the temporal pole (TP), the medial prefrontal cortex
   (mPFC) and the adjacent paracingulate cortex.
   To our knowledge, the neural basis of mentalizing has not yet been
   studied in a developmental perspective covering old age, so the aim of
   this work is to compare the neural basis of a specific aspect of ToM,
   the mindreading ability through the eyes, in healthy young and old
   subjects.
   Two groups of healthy adults (young: 25.2 years; old: 65.2 years) were
   submitted to an fMRI scanning while performing the Reading the Mind in
   the Eyes test, which requires the attribution of a mental state to the
   other person focussing only on the eye-gaze. There was no difference in
   the behavioural performances between young and old and both groups of
   subjects activated the pSTS and the TP, thus indicating that old people
   show no impairment of mentalizing circuits. However, a relevant shifting
   of the neural circuit implied in each group to solve the task emerged.
   Old subjects showed a more bilateral activation of frontal areas and a
   stronger involvement of the linguistic components of the mirror neuron
   system (i.e. area 44), as compared to young. Both young and old
   participants activated the non-linguistic components of the mirror
   neuron system, such as area 6. These findings are discussed taking into
   account the recent literature dealing with cognitive functions during
   normal aging. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have demonstrated a
   critical role for a cortical region in the right temporo-parietal
   junction (RTPJ) in ``theory of mind{''} (ToM), or mental state
   reasoning. In other research, the RTPJ has been implicated in the
   deployment of attention to an unexpected stimulus. One hypothesis
   ({''}attention hypothesis{''}) is that patterns of RTPJ activation in
   ToM tasks can be fully explained by appeal to attention: stimuli that
   apparently manipulate aspects of ToM are in fact manipulating aspects of
   attention. On an alternative hypothesis ({''}ToM hypothesis{''}),
   functional regions identified by ToM tasks are selective for ToM, and
   not just for any unexpected stimulus. Here, we used fMRI to test these
   competing hypotheses: are brain regions implicated in ToM, including the
   RTPJ, LTPJ, and precuneus, recruited specifically for mental states, or
   for any unexpected stimulus? We first identified brain regions
   implicated in ToM, using a standard paradigm: participants read stories
   about false beliefs and false physical representations (e.g.. outdated
   photographs). Participants also read a new set of stories describing
   mental or physical states, which were unexpected or expected. Regions of
   interest analyses revealed a higher response in the RTPJ, LTPJ, and
   precuneus, for mental versus physical stories, but no difference for
   unexpected and expected stories. Whole-brain random effects analyses
   also revealed higher activation in these regions for mental versus
   physical stories. This pattern provides evidence for the ToM hypothesis:
   the response in these functional regions is selective for mental state
   content, whether that content is unexpected or expected. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The exact relation between the sense that one's body is one's own
   (body-ownership) and the sense that one controls one's own bodily
   actions (agency) has been the focus of much speculation, but remains
   unclear. On an `additive' model, agency and body-ownership are strongly
   related; the ability to control actions is a powerful cue to
   body-ownership. This view implies a component common to the senses of
   body-ownership and agency, plus possible additional components unique to
   agency. An alternative `independence' model holds that agency and
   body-ownership are qualitatively different experiences, triggered by
   different inputs, and recruiting distinct brain networks. We tested
   these two specific models by investigating the sensory and motor aspects
   of body-representation in the brain using fMRI. Activations in midline
   cortical structures were associated with a sensory-driven sense of
   body-ownership, and were absent in agency conditions. Activity in the
   pre-SMA was linked to the sense of agency, but distinct from the sense
   of body-ownership. No shared activations that would support the additive
   model were found. The results support the independence model.
   Body-ownership involves a psychophysiological baseline, linked to
   activation of the brain's default mode network. Agency is linked to
   premotor and parietal areas involved in generating motor intentions and
   subsequent action monitoring. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Humans freely interpret moving shapes as being ``alive{''} and having
   social intentions, such as beliefs and desires. The brain systems
   underpinning these processes are the same as those used to detect
   animacy and infer mental states from human behaviour. However, it is not
   yet known if the brain systems that respond to human action-goals also
   respond to the action-goals of shapes. In the present paper, we used a
   repetition suppression paradigm during functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) to examine brain systems that respond to the action-goals
   of shapes. Participants watched video clips of simple, geometrical
   shapes performing different `take-object' goals. Repeated presentation
   of the same goal suppressed the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD)
   response in left anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS), a brain region
   known to distinguish the goals of human hand actions. This finding shows
   that left aIPS shows similar sensitivity to the action-goals of human
   and non-human agents. Our data complement previous work on animacy
   perception and mental state inference, which suggest components of the
   social brain are driven by the type of action comprehension that is
   engaged rather than by the form of the acting agent (i.e., human or
   shape). Further, the results have consequence for theories of goal
   understanding in situations without access to biological form or motion.

Abstract = {{Background. A wide range of neuropsychiatric conditions, including
   schizophrenia and autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), are associated with
   impairments in social function. Previous studies have shown that
   individuals with schizophrenia and ASD have deficits in making a wide
   range of social judgements from faces, including decisions related to
   threat (such as judgements of approachability) and decisions not related
   to physical threat (such as judgements of intelligence). We have
   investigated healthy control participants to see whether there is a
   common neural system activated during such social decisions, on the
   basis that deficits in this system may contribute to the impairments
   seen in these disorders.
   Method. We investigated the neural basis of social decision making
   during judgements of approachability and intelligence from faces in 24
   healthy participants using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   We used conjunction analysis to identify common brain regions activated
   during both tasks.
   Results. Activation of the amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, inferior
   prefrontal cortex and cerebellum was seen during performance of both
   social tasks, compared to simple gender judgements from the same
   stimuli. Task-specific activations were present in the dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex in the intelligence task and in the inferior and
   middle temporal cortex in the approachability task.
   Conclusions. The present study identified a common network of brain
   regions activated during the performance of two different forms of
   social judgement from faces. Dysfunction of this network is likely to
   contribute to the broad-ranging deficits in social function seen in
   psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and ASD.}},

Abstract = {{Biological motion perception is influenced by observers' familiarity
   with the observed action. Here, we used classical dance as a means to
   investigate how visual and motor experience modulates perceptual
   mechanism for configural processing of actions. Although some ballet
   moves are performed by only one gender, male and female dancers train
   together and acquire visual knowledge of all ballet moves. Twenty-four
   expert ballet dancers (12 female) and matched non-expert participants
   viewed pairs of upright and inverted point light female and common dance
   movements. Visual discrimination between different exemplars of the same
   movement presented upright was significantly better in experts than
   controls, whilst no differences were found when the same stimuli were
   presented upside down. These results suggest expertise influences
   configural action processing. Within the expert group, effects were
   stronger for female participants than for males, whilst no differences
   were found between movement types. This observer gender effect could
   suggest an additional role for motor familiarity in action perception,
   over and above the visual experience. Our results are consistent with a
   specific motor contribution to configural processing of action.}},

Abstract = {{Pain, whether caused by physical injury or social rejection, is an
   inevitable part of life. These two types of pain-physical and social-may
   rely on some of the same behavioral and neural mechanisms that register
   pain-related affect. To the extent that these pain processes overlap,
   acetaminophen, a physical pain suppressant that acts through central
   (rather than peripheral) neural mechanisms, may also reduce behavioral
   and neural responses to social rejection. In two experiments,
   participants took acetaminophen or placebo daily for 3 weeks. Doses of
   acetaminophen reduced reports of social pain on a daily basis
   (Experiment 1). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure
   participants' brain activity (Experiment 2), and found that
   acetaminophen reduced neural responses to social rejection in brain
   regions previously associated with distress caused by social pain and
   the affective component of physical pain (dorsal anterior cingulate
   cortex, anterior insula). Thus, acetaminophen reduces behavioral and
   neural responses associated with the pain of social rejection,
   demonstrating substantial overlap between social and physical pain.}},

Abstract = {{Previous small-sample studies have shown altered frontotemporal activity
   in schizophrenia patients with auditory hallucinations and impaired
   monitoring of self-generated speech. We examined a large cohort of
   patients with schizophrenia (n = 63) and a representative group of
   healthy controls (n = 20) to disentangle performance, illness, and
   symptom-related effects in functional magnetic resonance
   imaging-detected brain abnormalities during monitoring of self- and
   externally generated speech in schizophrenia. Our results revealed
   activation of the thalamus (medial geniculate nucleus, MGN) and
   frontotemporal regions with accurate monitoring across all participants.
   Less activation of the thalamus (MGN, pulvinar) and superior-middle
   temporal and inferior frontal gyri occurred in poorly performing
   patients (1 standard deviation below controls' mean; n = 36), relative
   to the combined group of controls and well-performing patients. In
   patients, (1) greater deactivation of the ventral striatum and
   hypothalamus to own voice, combined with nonsignificant activation of
   the same regions to others' voice, associated positively with negative
   symptoms (blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive
   social avoidance) regardless of performance and (2) exaggerated
   activation of the right superior-middle temporal gyrus during
   undistorted, relative to distorted, feedback associated with both
   positive symptoms (hallucinations, persecution) and poor performance. A
   further thalamic abnormality characterized schizophrenia patients
   regardless of performance and symptoms. We conclude that hypoactivation
   of a neural network comprised of the thalamus and frontotemporal regions
   underlies impaired speech monitoring in schizophrenia. Positive symptoms
   and poor monitoring share a common activation abnormality in the right
   superior temporal gyrus during processing of degraded speech. Altered
   striatal and hypothalamic modulation to own and others' voice
   characterizes emotionally withdrawn and socially avoidant patients.}},

   of reinforcement learning (RL) models that can account for human choice
   behavior during value-based decision making. The model generates
   internal variables which can be used to construct fMRI predictor
   variables and regressed against individual subjects' fMRI data. The
   resulting regression coefficients reflect the strength of the
   correlation with blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) activity and
   the relevant internal variables from the model. In the second part of
   this review, we describe human neuroimaging studies that have employed
   this analysis strategy to identify brain regions involved in the

Abstract = {{Brain regions associated with the processing of emotional stimuli are
   often also associated with the processing of social stimuli. Therefore,
   this network consisting of the amygdala, the anterior insula, the
   superior temporal sulcus (STS), and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) may
   rather be involved in more general relevance detection which should be
   independent of the sensory modality of the stimuli. In the current
   study, we used functional MRI to measure brain activations while
   participants either viewed pictures that varied in their emotional and
   social content or listened to sounds that varied along the same
   dimensions. The amygdala, the anterior insula, the STS, and the OFC
   showed increased activation during processing of emotional as well as
   social stimuli independent of the sensory modality in which the stimuli
   were presented. Moreover, social emotional stimuli elicited more
   pronounced activity in this network than stimuli with solely emotional
   or social content. These results indicate that the proposed network

Abstract = {{Daily we cope with upcoming potentially disadvantageous events.
   Therefore, it makes sense to be prepared for the worst case. Such a
   `pessimistic' bias is reflected in brain activation during emotion
   processing. Healthy individuals underwent functional neuroimaging while
   viewing emotional stimuli that were earlier cued ambiguously or
   unambiguously concerning their emotional valence. Presentation of
   ambiguously announced pleasant pictures compared with unambiguously
   announced pleasant pictures resulted in increased activity in the
   ventrolateral prefrontal, premotor and temporal cortex, and in the
   caudate nucleus. This was not the case for the respective negative
   conditions. This indicates that pleasant stimuli after ambiguous cueing
   provided `unexpected' emotional input, resulting in the adaptation of
   brain activity. It strengthens the hypothesis of a `pessimistic' bias of
   brain activation toward ambiguous emotional events. NeuroReport 21:

   Declarative Learning and Hippocampal Activity in Humans}},

Abstract = {{Background: The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is critical for
   learning-related synaptic plasticity in amygdala and hippocampus. As a
   consequence, there is considerable interest in drugs targeting this
   receptor to help enhance amygdala- and hippocampus-dependent learning. A
   promising candidate in this respect is the NMDAR glycine-binding site
   partial agonist D-cycloserine (DCS). Accumulating clinical evidence
   indicates the efficacy of DCS in the facilitation of amygdala-dependent
   fear extinction learning in patients with phobic, social anxiety, panic,
   and obsessive-compulsive disorder. An important unresolved question
   though is whether the use of DCS can also facilitate
   hippocampus-dependent declarative learning in healthy people as opposed
   to being restricted to the fear memory domain.
   Methods: In the present study, we investigated whether or not DCS can
   facilitate hippocampus-dependent declarative learning. We have therefore
   combined functional magnetic resonance imaging with two different
   declarative learning tasks and cytoarchitectonic probabilistic mapping
   of the hippocampus and its major subdivisions in 40 healthy volunteers
   administered either a 250 mg single oral dose of DCS or a placebo.
   Results: We found that DCS facilitates declarative learning as well as
   blood-oxygen level dependent activity levels in the probabilistically
   defined cornu ammonis region of the hippocampus. The absence of activity
   changes in visual control areas underscores the specific action of DCS
   in the hippocampal cornu ammonis region.
   Conclusions: Our findings highlight NMDAR glycine-binding site partial
   agonism as a promising pharmacological mechanism for facilitating
   declarative learning in healthy people.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have suggested that the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC)
   contributes both to understanding the mental states of others and to
   introspecting about one's own mind. This finding has suggested that
   perceivers might use their own thoughts and feelings as a starting point
   for making inferences about others, consistent with ``simulation{''} or
   ``self-projection{''} views of social cognition. However, perceivers
   cannot simply assume that others think and feel exactly as they do;
   social cognition also must include processes that adjust for perceived
   differences between self and other. Recent cognitive work has suggested
   that such correction occurs through a process of
   ``anchoring-and-adjustment{''} by which perceivers serially tune their
   inferences from an initial starting point based on their own
   introspections. Here, we used functional MRI to test two predictions
   derived from this anchoring-and-adjustment view. Participants (n = 64)
   used a Likert scale to judge the preferences of another person and to
   indicate their own preferences on the same items, allowing us to
   calculate the discrepancy between the participant's answers for self and
   other. Whole-brain parametric analyses identified a region in the MPFC
   in which activity was related linearly to this self-other discrepancy
   when inferring the mental states of others. These findings suggest both
   that the self serves as an important starting point from which to
   understand others and that perceivers customize such inferences by
   serially adjusting away from this anchor.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive control is required to regulate conflict. The conflict
   monitoring theory suggests that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex
   (dACC) is involved in detecting response conflict and the dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) plays a critical role in regulating conflict.
   Recent studies, however, have suggested that rostral dACC (rdACC)
   responds to response conflict whereas caudal dACC (cdACC) is associated
   with perceptual conflict. Moreover, DLPFC has been engaged only in
   regulation of response conflict. A neural network involved in perceptual
   conflict, however, remains unclear. In this study, we used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in an attempt to reveal
   monitor-controller networks corresponding to either perceptual conflict
   or response conflict. A version of the Stroop color matching task was
   used to manipulate perceptual conflict, response conflict was
   manipulated by an arrow. The results demonstrated that rdACC and DLPFC
   were engaged in response conflict whereas cdACC and the dorsal portion
   of premotor cortex (pre-PMd) were involved in perceptual conflict.
   Interestingly, the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) was activated by both
   types of conflict. Correlation analyses between behavioral conflict
   effects and neural responses demonstrated that rdACC and DLPFC were
   associated with response conflict whereas cdACC and pre-PMd were
   associated with perceptual conflict. PPC was not correlated with either
   perceptual conflict or response conflict. We suggest that cdACC and
   pre-PMd play critical roles in perceptual conflict processing, and this
   network is independent from the rdACC/DLPFC network for response
   conflict processing. We also discussed the function of PPC in conflict
   processing. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Phan et al. (2008) recently reported that an acute dose of oral THC is
   associated with a decrease in threat-related amygdala reactivity during
   a social threat stimulus task. However, to date, those findings have not
   been replicated, and have not been extended to clinical studies
   involving smoked rather than oral cannabis. In this study, we
   hypothesized that level of cannabis smoked by participants in our
   treatment study would be inversely related to the level of
   threat-related amygdala reactivity. Subjects were recruited from among
   participants in our double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of fluoxetine
   in comorbid youth with cannabis dependence/major depression. The
   threat-related amygdala reactivity task used by Hariri et al. (2009) was
   completed during BOLD fMRI scans at study baseline and then again 12
   weeks later at the end of the trial. Data are available from six
   subjects with pre-and post-treatment fMRI data. During the course of the
   study, five of the six subjects demonstrated a decrease in their level
   of cannabis use, with a mean decrease of 64\%, and those persons all
   demonstrated an increase in their level of amygdala reactivity. One
   subject demonstrated an increase in their level of cannabis use (a 79\%
   increase) during the treatment trial, and that person demonstrated a
   decrease in their level of amygdala reactivity. Thus, a higher level of
   cannabis use was consistently associated with a lower level of amygdala
   reactivity across all subjects (matched pairs t = 2.70, df = 5, p<0.05,
   two-tailed). These findings are consistent with the reports by Phan et
   al. (2008) and Hariri et al. (2009) suggesting that cannabinoids have an
   inhibitory effect on threat-related amygdala reactivity. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{A major evolutionary advance of humans is a mind that is capable of
   constructing, perpetuating, adapting to, and exploiting culture. The
   birth of cultural neuroscience reflects the growing realization that a
   full account of the human mind requires understanding of the multiple
   and reciprocal influences between the biological and the sociocultural.
   In the present paper, we illustrate how attention to the brain, as
   exemplified in functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging (fMRI) studies
   of sociocultural processes, contributes to a more comprehensive
   understanding of the human mind. We end by discussing a set of
   challenges facing researchers using fMRI and the possible means for
   dealing with these challenges.}},

Abstract = {{Emotional signals are of pivotal relevance in social interactions.
   Neuroimaging and lesion studies have established an important role of
   the amygdala for the processing of these signals. While the human
   amygdala receives input from all sensory modalities, it is the visual
   modality that is most important for emotional aspects in social
   interactions. Consequently, amygdala involvement in visual emotional
   processing has been unequivocally established, whereas its role in
   auditory emotional processing is less clear. To investigate amygdala
   involvement in auditory emotional processing, we used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging in sighted and connatally blind volunteers,
   the latter of which lack visual experience during development but have
   outstanding capabilities to process auditory signals, which are their
   dominant source of information in social interactions. First, we
   observed a performance advantage of the connatally blind in auditory
   discrimination tasks that was paralleled by occipital cortex activation,
   which was not present in the sighted. More importantly, the blind not
   only showed robust selective activation in the amygdala to fearful and
   angry compared to neutral voices but also showed stronger activation to
   those stimuli than sighted participants. Higher amygdala activity for
   fearful items was further associated with individual performance in the
   blind, indicating that amygdala activation in the blind is not only
   driven by blindness per se but also by inter-individual differences in
   auditory capabilities. Our results indicate that the responsivity of the
   amygdala to emotional signals develops even in the absence of visual
   emotional experience and serves the sensory modality which is the most
   reliable source of emotional information.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{73}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Does the sight of multiple climbing holds laid along a path activate a
   motor simulation of climbing that path? One way of testing whether
   multiple affordances and their displacement influence the formation of a
   motor simulation is to study acquired motor skills. We used a behavioral
   task in which expert and novice rock climbers were shown three routes:
   an easy route, a route impossible to climb but perceptually salient, and
   a difficult route. After a distraction task, they were then given a
   recall test in which they had to write down the sequence of holds
   composing each route. We found no difference between experts and novices
   on the easy and impossible routes, whereas on the difficult route, the
   performance of experts was better than that of novices. This suggests
   that seeing a climbing wall activates a motor, embodied simulation,
   which relies not on perceptual salience, but on motor competence. More
   importantly, our results show that the capability to form this
   simulation is modulated by individuals' motor repertoire and expertise,
   and that this strongly impacts recall. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The human brain has the fascinating ability to represent and to process
   several languages. Although the first and further languages activate
   partially different brain networks, the linguistic factors underlying
   these differences in language processing have to be further specified.
   We investigated the neural correlates of language proficiency in a
   homogeneous sample of multilingual native Ladin speakers from a mountain
   valley in South Tyrol, Italy, who speak Italian as second language at a
   high level, and English at an intermediate level. In a constrained word
   production task under functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
   participants had to name pictures of objects in Ladin, Italian and
   English in separate blocks. Overall, multilingual word production
   activated a common set of brain areas dedicated to known subcomponents
   of picture naming. In comparison to English, the fluently spoken
   languages Ladin and Italian were associated with enhanced right
   prefrontal activity. In addition, the MR signal in right prefrontal
   cortex correlated with naming accuracy as a measure of language
   proficiency. Our results demonstrate the significance of right
   prefrontal areas for language proficiency. Based on the role of these
   areas for cognitive control, our findings suggest that right prefrontal
   cortex supports language proficiency by effectively supervising word
   retrieval. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper assessed the neural systems involved in processing of dynamic
   facial expressions in adolescents. The processing of facial expressions
   changes as a function of age, and it is thus important to understand how
   healthy adolescent subjects process dynamic facial expressions prior to
   analyzing disease-related changes. We hypothesized that viewing of
   dynamic facial expressions with opposing valences (happy vs. fearful)
   induces differential activations and deactivations in the brain. 27
   healthy adolescents (9 a (TM) Euro, 18 a (TM),, mean age = 14.5 years;
   age range 11.6-17.3 years) were examined by using the ASSQ and K-SADS-PL
   and scanned with 1.5-T fMRI during viewing of dynamic facial expressions
   and mosaic control images. The stimuli activated the same areas as
   previously seen in dynamic facial expression in adults. Our results
   indicated that opposing-valence dynamic facial expressions had
   differential effects on many cortical structures but not on subcortical
   limbic structures. The mirror neuron system is activated more during
   viewing of fearful compared to happy expressions in bilateral inferior
   frontal gyrus (IFG) and superior temporal sulcus (STS) left dominantly.
   We also detected more deactivation in the ventral anterior cingulate
   gyrus (ACG), showing more automated attentional processing of fearful
   expressions during passive viewing. Females were found to deactivate the
   right frontal pole more than male adolescents during happy facial
   expressions, while there were no differences in fear processing between
   genders. No clear gender or age effects were detected. In conclusion
   fear induces stronger responses in attention and mirror neurons probably
   related to fear contagion.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. - A better understanding of the pathophysiology of suicidal
   behaviour (SB) may enable the discovery of more specific treatments and
   a better identification of vulnerable patients. The vulnerability to SB
   appears to be underlied by genetic factors coding for traits rendering
   the individual less able to cope with stressing situations, and more
   likely to be engaged in a suicidal process.
   Method. - During the recent years, neuroscientific studies begun to
   identify potential endophenotypes.
   Results. - We have shown that disadvantageous decision making (DM) was
   involved in the vulnerability to SB. DM impairment appears to be
   independent of comorbid psychiatric disorders, associated with emotional
   dysregulation (i.e. affective lability trait and skin conductance
   responses), and modulated by serotonergic genotypes associated with SB.
   In recent fMRI studies, the region that is likely involved in DM, is
   overactivited in response to angry faces, suggesting a higher
   sensitivity to specific negative social stimuli. Deficit in risk
   evaluation and excessive response to specific emotional stimuli may
   represent key processes in the vulnerability to SB.
   Conclusions. - These potential endophenotypes may represent future
   relevant markers of vulnerability for the identification of vulnerable
   patients, and relevant targets for the development of new treatments.

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Like other species, humans are sensitive to the decisions and actions of
   conspecifics, which can lead to herd behavior and undesirable outcomes
   such as stock market bubbles and bank runs. However, how the brain
   processes this socially derived influence is only poorly understood.
   Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we scanned
   participants as they made decisions on whether to buy stocks after
   observing others' buying decisions. We demonstrate that activity in the
   ventral striatum, an area heavily implicated in reward processing,
   tracked the degree of influence on participants' decisions arising from
   the observation of other peoples' decisions. The signal did not track
   non-human, non-social control decisions. These findings lend weight to
   the notion that the ventral striatum is involved in the processing of
   complex social aspects of decision making and identify a possible neural
   basis for herd behavior.}},

Abstract = {{There is an inconsistency regarding the relationship between thinking
   about personal past experiences during autobiographical memory (AM) and
   thinking about other people's mental states during theory of mind (ToM).
   Neuroimaging studies of AM and ToM consistently report overlap in the
   brain regions recruited. Lesion data, however, show that amnesic people
   with AM impairment can have intact ToM, suggesting that distinct neural
   mechanisms support these abilities {[}Rosenbaum, R. S., Stuss, D. T.,
   Levine, B., \& Tulving, E. Theory of mind is independent of episodic
   memory. Science, 318, 1257, 2007]. The current fMRI study examined the
   functional and neural correlates of remembering one's own experiences in
   response to personal photos (AM condition) and imagining others'
   experiences in response to strangers' photos (ToM condition). AM and ToM
   conditions were matched in terms of content and vividness, and were
   compared directly and to a common baseline. Analyses revealed common
   activity within frontal and temporal-parietal regions, yet midline
   structures exhibited greater activity during AM. More specific analyses
   of event construction and detail elaboration revealed unique activation
   of the right hippocampus during AM construction, and of lateral regions,
   such as the right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) during ToM
   elaboration. Moreover, a region of left hippocampus/perirhinal cortex
   appeared to be driven by event vividness. Thus, differences in AM and
   ToM emerge when a common baseline is used and temporal dynamics are
   taken into account. Furthermore, the right TPJ and related lateral
   regions, and not the hippocampus, may be needed for ToM, given that this
   ability is intact in amnesic people.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) demonstrate an abnormally

   performed an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study
   while individuals with WS and typically developing controls (TD) matched
   positive and negative emotional faces. WS compared to TD showed reduced
   right amygdala activation during presentation of negative faces, as in
   the previous literature. In addition, WS showed a unique pattern of
   right orbitofrontal cortex activation. While TD showed medial
   orbitofrontal cortex activation in response to positive, and lateral
   orbitofrontal cortex activation to negative, WS showed the opposite
   pattern. In light of the general notion of a medial/lateral gradient of
   reward/punishment processing in the orbitofrontal cortex, these findings
   provide an additional biological explanation for, or correlate of
   positive attribution bias and hypersociability in WS.}},

Abstract = {{Determining whom to trust and whom to distrust is a major decision in
   impersonal IT-enabled exchanges. Despite the potential role of both
   trust and distrust in impersonal exchanges, the information systems
   literature has primarily focused on trust, alas paying relatively little
   attention to distrust. Given the importance of studying both trust and
   distrust, this study alms to shed light on the nature, dimensionality,
   distinction, and relationship, and relative effects of trust and
   distrust on economic outcomes in the context of impersonal IT-enabled
   exchanges between buyers and sellers in online marketplaces.
   This study uses functional neuroimaging (fMRI) tools to complement
   psychometric measures of trust and distrust by observing the location,
   timing, and level of brain activity that underlies trust and distrust
   and their underlying dimensions. The neural correlates of trust and
   distrust are identified when subjects interact with four experimentally
   manipulated seller profiles that differ on their level of trust and
   distrust. The results show that trust and distrust activate different
   brain areas and have different effects, helping explain why trust and
   distrust are distinct constructs associated with different neurological
   processes. Implications for the nature, distinction and relationship,
   dimensionality, and effects of trust and distrust are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Being in a close relationship is essential to human existence. Such
   closeness can be described as including other in the self and be
   underpinned on social attachment system, which evolved from a
   redirection of nociceptive mechanisms. To what extent does imagining a
   loved-one differs from imagining an unfamiliar individual being in
   painful situations? In this functional MRI study, participants were
   exposed to animated stimuli depicting hands or feet in painful and
   non-painful situations, and instructed to imagine these scenarios from
   three different perspectives: self, loved-one and stranger after being
   primed with their respective photographs. In line with previous studies,
   the three perspectives were associated with activation of the neural
   network involved in pain processing. Specifically, adopting the
   perspective of a loved-one increased activity in the anterior cingulate
   cortex and insula, whereas imagining a stranger induced a signal
   increase in the right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and superior
   frontal gyrus. The closer the participants' relationships were with
   their partner, the greater the deactivation in the right TPJ. A negative
   effective connectivity between the right TPJ and the insula, and a
   positive one with the superior frontal gyrus were found when
   participants imagined the perspective of a stranger. These results
   demonstrate that intimacy affects the bottom-up information processing
   involved in empathy, as indicated by greater overlap between neural
   representations of the self and the other. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Human communication and survival depend on effective social information
   processing. Abundant behavioral evidence has shown that humans
   efficiently judge preferences for other individuals, a critical task in
   social interaction, yet the neural mechanism of this basic social
   evaluation, remains less than clear. Using a socio-emotional preference
   task and connectivity analyses (psycho-physiological interaction) of
   fMRI data, we first demonstrated that cortical midline structures
   (medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices) and the
   task-positive network typically implicated in carrying out goal-directed
   tasks (pre-supplementary motor area, dorsal anterior cingulate and
   bilateral frontoparietal cortices) were both recruited when subjects
   made a preference judgment, relative to gender identification, to human
   faces. Connectivity analyses further showed network interactions among
   these cortical midline structures, and with the task-positive network,
   both of which vary as a function of social preference. Overall, the data
   demonstrate the involvement of cortical midline structures in forming
   social preference, and provide evidence of network interactions which
   might reflect a mechanism by which an individual regularly forms and
   expresses this fundamental decision. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Violence is an important social problem. Violence in the community has
   important social relevance for the political, criminal justice, and
   health care systems. Studies of homicide offenders have suggested a high
   prevalence of neurologic dysfunction due to organic brain damage such as
   traumatic brain injury, epilepsy and dementia have been observed to
   exhibit excessive violence. Moreover, violence in the mentally ill can
   be viewed as an important medical and mental health problem with
   significant implications for forensic psychiatry and the community.
   Although numerous previous studies showed that rate of violent behavior
   in the community is not much higher in patients with serious mental
   disorders (schizophrenia) than in healthy controls, that rate is
   substantially higher in patients with psychiatric comorbidity and
   substance abuse. A high proportion of patients in forensic psychiatric
   facilities are diagnosed with comorbidity, most often with
   schizophrenia, paranoid psychosis, organic brain syndrome, various
   personality disorders and comorbid substance abuse. These patients
   represent a high risk group for violence within forensic psychiatric
   facilities, and repetitive violent behavior in the community.
   Understanding the neurobiological basis of aggressive behavior clearly
   has important social and clinical implications. By introduction of
   neuroimaging studies (MU, fMRI, PET, SPECT) as a useful tool in forensic
   psychiatry, the neurobiological aspect of violence is better understood.
   Previous studies have shown that individuals with frontotemporal brain
   dysfunction are frequently displaying antisocial behavior
   (disinhibition, impulsivity, lack of empathy) that justify the diagnosis
   of ``acquired sociopathy/psychopathy{''}. A correlation between the
   potential for impulsive aggression mediated by limbic brain structures,
   and the control of the aggression by frontotemporal brain regions has
   been shown. The individuals with such brain dysfunction have an
   increased risk of violent behavior and scored high on the Webster's and
   Hare's violence risk assessment scale. This article reviews the
   relationship between psychiatric comorbidity, violence risk assessment
   and neuro imaging in forensic psychiatry and showing the useful
   directions for future research, screening and prevention of violent
   behavior among mentally ill criminal offenders.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we argue that a combined anthropology/neuroscience
   field of enquiry can make a significant and distinctive contribution to
   the study of the relationship between culture and the brain. This field,

   as being complementary to and mutually informative with social and
   cultural neuroscience. We start by providing an introduction to the
   culture concept in anthropology. We then present a detailed
   characterization of neuroanthropology and its methods and how they
   relate to the anthropological understanding of culture. The field is
   described as a humanistic science, that is, a field of enquiry founded
   on the perceived epistemological and methodological interdependence of
   science and the humanities. We also provide examples that illustrate the
   proposed methodological model for neuroanthropology. We conclude with a
   discussion about specific contributions the field can make to the study

Abstract = {{The current study employed functional MRI to investigate the
   contribution of domain-general (e. g. executive functions) and
   domain-specific (e. g. semantic knowledge) processes to differences in
   semantic judgments across cultures. Previous behavioral experiments have
   identified cross-cultural differences in categorization, with East
   Asians preferring strategies involving thematic or functional
   relationships (e. g. cow-grass) and Americans preferring categorical
   relationships (e. g. cow-chicken). East Asians and American participants
   underwent functional imaging while alternating between categorical or
   thematic strategies to sort triads of words, as well as matching words
   on control trials. Many similarities were observed. However, across both
   category and relationship trials compared to match (control) trials,
   East Asians activated a frontal-parietal network implicated in
   controlled executive processes, whereas Americans engaged regions of the
   temporal lobes and the cingulate, possibly in response to conflict in
   the semantic content of information. The results suggest that cultures
   differ in the strategies employed to resolve conflict between competing
   semantic judgments.}},

Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, complex cultural symbols like brands are investigated
   with psychological approaches. Often this is done by using semantic
   differentials, in which participants are asked to rate a brand regarding
   different pairs of adjectives. Only recently, functional magnetic
   resonance imaging ( fMRI) has been used to examine brands. In the
   current work we used fMRI in combination with a semantic differential to
   cross-validate both methods and to improve the characterization of the
   basic factors constituting the semantic space. To this end we presented
   pictures of brands while recording subject's brain activity during an
   fMRI experiment. Results of the semantic differential arranged the
   brands in a semantic space illustrating their relationships to other
   cultural symbols. FMRI results revealed activation of the medial
   prefrontal cortex for brands that loaded high on the factor `social
   competence', suggesting an involvement of a cortical network associated
   with social cognitions. In contrast, brands closely related to the
   factor `potency' showed decreased activity in the superior frontal gyri,
   possibly related to working memory during task performance. We discuss
   the results as a different engagement of the prefrontal cortex when
   perceiving brands as cultural symbols.}},

Abstract = {{This study explored the role of culture in shaping music perception and
   memory. We tested the hypothesis that listeners demonstrate different
   patterns of activation associated with music processing-particularly
   right frontal cortex-when encoding and retrieving culturally familiar
   and unfamiliar stimuli, with the latter evoking broader activation
   consistent with more complex memory tasks. Subjects (n = 16) were
   right-handed adults born and raised in the USA (n = 8) or Turkey (n = 8)
   with minimal music training. Using fMRI procedures, we scanned subjects
   during two tasks: (i) listening to novel musical examples from their own
   culture and an unfamiliar culture and (ii) identifying which among a
   series of brief excerpts were taken from the longer examples. Both
   groups were more successful remembering music of their home culture. We
   found greater activation for culturally unfamiliar music listening in
   the left cerebellar region, right angular gyrus, posterior precuneus and
   right middle frontal area extending into the inferior frontal cortex.
   Subjects demonstrated greater activation in the cingulate gyrus and
   right lingual gyrus when engaged in recall of culturally unfamiliar
   music. This study provides evidence for the influence of culture on
   music perception and memory performance at both a behavioral and

Abstract = {{Representations of self are thought to be dynamically influenced by

   neuroimaging studies of self-representations have either ignored

   present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the
   neural correlates of individual differences in interdependent
   self-construal. Participants rated whether trait adjectives applied to
   themselves or their mothers, or judged their valence or font. Findings
   indicated that individual differences in interdependent self-construal
   correlated positively with increased activation in the medial prefrontal
   cortex and posterior cingulated cortex when making judgments about
   one-self vs making judgments about one's mother. This suggests that
   those with greater interdependent self-construals may rely more upon
   episodic memory, reflected appraisals, or theory of mind to incorporate

Abstract = {{Previous transcultural neuroimaging studies have shown that the neural

   functional anatomy of self-representation. We replicated the previous
   results in Han participants with the ventral medial prefrontal cortex
   and left anterior cingulate cortex showing stronger activation in
   self-processing when compared with other-processing conditions. However,
   no typical self-reference pattern was identified in Tibetan participants
   on behavioral or neural levels. This could be explained by the minimal
   subjective sense of `I-ness' in Tibetan Buddhists. Our findings lend
   support to the presumed role of culture and religion in shaping the

Abstract = {{Our recent work showed that self-trait judgment is associated with
   increased activity in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) in
   non-religious Chinese, but in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex
   (DMPFC) in Chinese Christians. The current work further investigated
   neural substrates of self-referential processing in Chinese Buddhists.
   Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we scanned 14 Chinese
   Buddhists, while they conducted trait judgments of the self, Zhu Rongji
   (the former Chinese premier), Sakyamuni (the Buddhist leader) and Jesus
   (the Christian leader). We found that, relative to Zhu Rongji judgment,
   self-judgment in Buddhist participants failed to generate increased
   activation in the VMPFC but induced increased activations in the
   DMPFC/rostral anterior cingulate cortex, midcingulate and the left
   frontal/insular cortex. Self-judgment was also associated with decreased
   functional connectivity between the DMPFC and posterior parietal cortex
   compared with Zhu Rongji judgment. The results suggest that Buddhist
   doctrine of No-self results in weakened neural coding of stimulus
   self-relatedness in the VMPFC, but enhanced evaluative processes of
   self-referential stimuli in the DMPFC. Moreover, self-referential
   processing in Buddhists is characterized by monitoring the conflict
   between the doctrine of No-self and self-focus thinking during
   self-trait judgment.}},

Abstract = {{Voting to determine one's leaders is among the most important decisions
   we make, yet little is known about the brain's role in how we come to
   these decisions. Behavioral studies have indicated that snap judgments
   of political candidates' faces can predict election outcomes but that
   the traits that lead to these judgments differ across cultures. Here we
   sought to investigate the neural basis for these judgments. American and
   Japanese natives performed simulated voting judgments of actual American
   and Japanese political candidates while neural activity was measured
   using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Candidates for whom
   participants chose to vote elicited stronger responses in the bilateral
   amygdala than candidates for whom participants chose not to vote. This
   was true regardless of either the participant's culture or the target's
   culture, suggesting that these voting decisions provoked the same neural
   response cross-culturally. In addition, we observed a participant
   culture by target culture interaction in the bilateral amygdala.
   American and Japanese participants both showed a stronger response to
   cultural outgroup faces than they did to cultural ingroup faces, however
   this was unrelated to their voting decisions. These data provide insight
   to the mechanisms that underlie our snap judgments of others when making
   voting decisions and provide a neural correlate to cross-cultural
   consensus in social inferences.}},

Abstract = {{The understanding that other people's emotional states depend on the
   fulfilment of their intention is fundamentally important for responding
   adequately to others. Psychopathic patients show severe deficits in
   responding adequately to other people's emotion The present study
   explored whether these impairments are associated with deficits in the
   ability to infer others' emotional states. Using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI), identical cartoon stories, depicting a subject
   whose intention was fulfilled or not fulfilled, were presented to 14
   psychopathic patients and 14 non-psychopathic patients The participants
   should indicate the protagonist's emotional state. Additionally, a
   non-mentalizing control condition was presented. The two groups showed
   no behavioural differences But in non-psychopathic patients emotion
   attribution was associated with increased activity of the mirror neuron
   system, the bilateral supramarginal gyrus and the superior frontal gyrus
   In contrast psychopathic patients showed increased activation of regions
   associated with outcome monitoring and attention, such as the
   orbitofrontal cortex, the medial frontal cortex and temporo-parietal
   areas. The results emphasize that although psychopathic patients show no
   deficits in reasoning about other people's emotion if an explicit
   evaluation is demanded, they use divergent neural processing strategies
   that are related to more rational, outcome-oriented processes (C) 2010

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Empathy and affective appraisals for conspecifics are among the
   hallmarks of social interaction. Using functional MRI, we hypothesized
   that vegetarians and vegans, who made their feeding choice for ethical
   reasons, might show brain responses to conditions of suffering involving
   humans or animals different from omnivores. We recruited 20 omnivore
   subjects, 19 vegetarians, and 21 vegans. The groups were matched for sex
   and age. Brain activation was investigated using fMRI and an
   event-related design during observation of negative affective pictures
   of human beings and animals (showing mutilations, murdered people,
   human/animal threat, tortures, wounds, etc.). Participants saw
   negative-valence scenes related to humans and animals, alternating with
   natural landscapes. During human negative valence scenes, compared with
   omnivores, vegetarians and vegans had an increased recruitment of the
   anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). More
   critically, during animal negative valence scenes, they had decreased
   amygdala activation and increased activation of the lingual gyri, the
   left cuneus, the posterior cingulate cortex and several areas mainly
   located in the frontal lobes, including the ACC, the IFG and the middle
   frontal gyrus. Nonetheless, also substantial differences between
   vegetarians and vegans have been found responding to negative scenes.
   Vegetarians showed a selective recruitment of the right inferior
   parietal lobule during human negative scenes, and a prevailing
   activation of the ACC during animal negative scenes. Conversely, during
   animal negative scenes an increased activation of the inferior
   prefrontal cortex was observed in vegans. These results suggest that
   empathy toward non conspecifics has different neural representation
   among individuals with different feeding habits, perhaps reflecting
   different motivational factors and beliefs.}},

Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{1332}},

Month = {{MAY 21}},
Abstract = {{We used positron emission tomography (PET) to investigate the neural
   mechanisms underlying the willingness to forgive another person's moral
   transgression involving deception. During scanning, 12 subjects were
   asked to judge the forgivability of a perpetrator's moral transgression.
   These transgressions were described by four kinds of scenarios composed
   of a combination of two factors: the attitude of the perpetrator
   (dishonest or honest) and the severity of the moral transgression
   (serious or minor). Behavioral data showed that both the perpetrator's
   dishonesty and the seriousness of the scenario decreased the subjects'
   willingness to forgive the moral transgression. Neuroimaging data
   revealed that, relative to honest responses, a perpetrator's dishonest
   responses were associated with right ventromedial prefrontal activity,
   which possibly reflects the subjects' identification of the
   perpetrator's deception. The opposite comparison did not show
   significant activation. Moreover, a comparison of serious scenarios with
   minor scenarios did not reveal significant activation. Instead, minor
   scenarios, relative to serious scenarios, evoked activity in the right
   middle frontal gyrus and the right caudate nucleus, possibly reflecting
   increased demand on frontal control system function. Further analysis
   revealed that the left ventromedial prefrontal cortex showed a
   significant interaction between the two factors, indicating that this
   region functions as a mediator of the two factors, modulating judgments
   regarding the forgivability of moral transgressions. Taken together,
   these findings suggest that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex plays a
   key role in the forgiveness of moral transgressions involving deception.

Abstract = {{The neuropeptide vasopressin is a modulator of mammalian social behavior
   and emotion, particularly fear, aggression, and anxiety. In humans, the
   neural circuitry underlying behavioral effects of vasopressin is
   unknown. Using a double-blind crossover administration of 40 IU of
   vasopressin or placebo and functional MRI during processing of facial
   emotions in healthy male volunteers, we show that vasopressin
   specifically reduces differential activation in the subgenual cingulate
   cortex. Structural equation modeling of a previously evaluated circuit
   between amygdala, subgenual cingulate, and supragenual cingulate
   revealed altered effective connectivity between subgenual and
   supragenual cingulate under vasopressin. Our data demonstrate an impact
   of vasopressin on activity and connectivity in the cortical component of
   a medial prefrontal cortex-amygdala circuit implicated in emotional
   regulation, providing the first data on the neural basis for the effects
   of vasopressin on social behavior in humans with potential therapeutic
   significance for mood and anxiety disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Both the putative mirror neuron system (pMNS) and the ventral medial
   prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) are deemed important for social interaction:
   the pMNS because it supposedly ``resonates{''} with the actions of
   others, the vmPFC because it is involved in mentalizing. Strictly
   speaking, the resonance property of the pMNS has never been
   investigated. Classical functional MRI experiments have only
   investigated whether pMNS regions augment their activity when an action
   is seen or executed. Resonance, however, entails more than only ``going
   on and off together{''}. Activity in the pMNS of an observer should
   continuously follow the more subtle changes over time in activity of the
   pMNS of the actor. Here we directly explore whether such resonance
   indeed occurs during continuous streams of actions. We let participants
   play the game of charades while we measured brain activity of both
   gesturer and guesser. We then applied a method to localize directed
   influences between the brains of the participants: between-brain
   Granger-causality mapping. Results show that a guesser's brain activity
   in regions involved in mentalizing and mirroring echoes the temporal
   structure of a gesturer's brain activity. This provides evidence for
   resonance theories and indicates a fine-grained temporal interplay
   between regions involved in motor planning and regions involved in
   thinking about the mental states of others. Furthermore, this method
   enables experiments to be more ecologically valid by providing the
   opportunity to leave social interaction unconstrained. This, in turn,
   would allow us to tap into the neural substrates of social deficits such
   as autism spectrum disorder.}},

Abstract = {{Background: A tendency to orient attention toward threatening stimuli
   may be involved in the etiology of anxiety disorders. In keeping with
   this, both psychological and pharmacological treatments of anxiety
   reduce this negative attentional bias. It has been hypothesized, but not
   proved, that psychological interventions may alter the function of
   prefrontal regions supervising the allocation of attentional resources.
   Methods: The current study examined the effects of a cognitive training
   regime on attention. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two
   training conditions: ``attend-threat{''} training, which increases
   negative attentional bias, or ``avoid-threat{''} training, which reduces
   it. The behavioral effects of training were assessed using a sample of
   24 healthy participants. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were
   collected in a further 29 healthy volunteers using a protocol that
   allowed the influence of both stimuli valence and attention to be
   discriminated.
   Results: Cognitive training induced the expected attentional biases in
   healthy volunteers. Further, the training altered lateral frontal
   activation to emotional stimuli, with these areas responding
   specifically to violations of the behavioral rules learned during
   training. Connectivity analysis confirmed that the identified lateral
   frontal regions were influencing attention as indexed by activity in
   visual association cortex.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that frontal control over the
   processing of emotional stimuli may be tuned by psychological
   interventions in a manner predicted to regulate levels of anxiety. This
   directly supports the proposal that psychological interventions may
   influence attention via an effect on the prefrontal cortex.}},

Abstract = {{Williams syndrome(WS) is a genetic condition characterized by atypical
   brain structure, cognitive deficits, and a life-long fascination with
   faces. Face recognition is relatively spared in WS, despite
   abnormalities in aspects of face processing and structural alterations
   in the fusiform gyrus, part of the ventral visual stream. Thus, face
   recognition in WS may be subserved by abnormal neural substrates in the
   ventral stream. To test this hypothesis, we used functional magnetic
   resonance imaging and examined the fusiform face area (FFA), which is
   implicated in face recognition in typically developed (TD) individuals,
   but its role in WS is not well understood. We found that the FFA was
   approximately two times larger among WS than TD participants (both
   absolutely and relative to the fusiform gyrus), despite apparently
   normal levels of face recognition performance on a Benton face
   recognition test. Thus, a larger FFA may play a role in face recognition
   proficiency among WS.}},

Journal = {{ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Background:
   Activation of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in a spatial working
   memory task has been associated with risk factors for alcohol use
   disorders such as low alcohol effects and positive alcohol expectations
   in adolescents. To transfer these results into adults, we used the same
   task in adults.
   Methods:
   During functional magnetic resonance imaging, 12 light social, 7 heavy
   social, and 11 non-abstinent-dependent alcohol drinkers performed a
   spatial working memory task and completed measures of automatic
   alcohol-related thoughts and behavior (Obsessive-Compulsive Drinking
   Scale-OCDS), alcohol use of the last 90 days, and general intelligence.
   Results:
   Behavioral performance in the spatial working memory task was not
   significantly different in all 3 groups. Controlling for differences in
   general intelligence alcohol-dependent participants showed a higher
   task-related activation of the dorsal ACC (dACC) in comparison with
   light and heavy social drinkers. Measures of the OCDS were positively
   correlated with the activation in the left hippocampus and right
   thalamus in all participants.
   Conclusions:
   Our results support the findings of increased dACC activation during a
   spatial working memory task as a risk factor for alcohol dependence.
   Increased task-related activation in the dACC was only observed in
   alcohol-dependent participants and not in heavy social drinkers with
   comparable alcohol consumption. Furthermore, the absence of behavioral
   performance differences between groups as well as an association between
   dACC activation and working memory performance indicates subtle working
   memory deficits. Low capacity of working memory has been linked to more
   automatic and less self-regulated behavior in studies on natural reward
   processing. Therefore, additional neural activation during performance
   of the non-alcohol-related working memory task in participants with
   higher OCDS values in the left hippocampus and the right thalamus may be
   a consequence of decreased neural capacity because of distracting
   alcohol-related thoughts.}},

Abstract = {{The neural basis of abnormal processing of phobia-related linguistic

   event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, this study
   investigated brain activation to phobia-related and phobia-unrelated
   words in 19 socially phobic patients and 18 healthy control subjects
   (HC) while subjects had to attend either to social meaning or to
   grammatical category of words (direct or indirect task). During the
   indirect task, patients, compared to HC, showed an increased activation
   of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in response to
   phobia-related vs. phobia-unrelated words. Activation of the insula was
   positively correlated with patients' symptom severity during the direct
   task. The results suggest a specific role of the amygdala and OFC during
   the processing of verbal phobia-relevant distracting information. In
   contrast, insula activation seems to be more important for direct
   processing of disorder-related words, especially in more severe cases of

Abstract = {{The processing of visual and haptic inputs, occurring either separately
   or jointly, is crucial for everyday-life object recognition, and has
   been a focus of recent neuroimaging research. Previously, visuohaptic
   convergence has been mostly investigated with matching-task paradigms.
   However, much less is known about visuohaptic convergence in the absence
   of additional task demands. We conducted two functional magnetic
   resonance imaging experiments in which subjects actively touched and/or
   viewed unfamiliar object stimuli without any additional task demands. In
   addition, we performed two control experiments with audiovisual and
   audiohaptic stimulation to examine the specificity of the observed
   visuohaptic convergence effects. We found robust visuohaptic convergence
   in bilateral lateral occipital cortex and anterior cerebellum. In
   contrast, neither the anterior cerebellum nor the lateral occipital
   cortex showed any involvement in audiovisual or audiohaptic convergence,
   indicating that multisensory convergence in these regions is
   specifically geared to visual and haptic inputs. These data suggest that
   in humans the lateral occipital cortex and the anterior cerebellum play
   an important role in visuohaptic processing even in the absence of
   additional task demands.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the neural systems that contribute to the formation of
   complex, self-relevant emotional memories, dedicated fans of rival
   college basketball teams watched a competitive game while undergoing
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). During a subsequent
   recognition memory task, participants were shown video clips depicting
   plays of the game, stemming either from previously-viewed game segments
   (targets) or from non-viewed portions of the same game (foils). After an
   old-new judgment, participants provided emotional valence and intensity
   ratings of the clips. A data driven approach was first used to decompose
   the fMRI signal acquired during free viewing of the game into spatially
   independent components. Correlations were then calculated between the
   identified components and post-scanning emotion ratings for successfully
   encoded targets. Two components were correlated with intensity ratings,
   including temporal lobe regions implicated in memory and emotional
   functions, such as the hippocampus and amygdala, as well as a midline
   fronto-cingulo-parietal network implicated in social cognition and
   self-relevant processing. These data were supported by a general linear
   model analysis, which revealed additional valence effects in
   fronto-striatal-insular regions when plays were divided into positive
   and negative events according to the fan's perspective. Overall, these
   findings contribute to our understanding of how emotional factors impact
   distributed neural systems to successfully encode dynamic,
   personally-relevant event sequences.}},

Abstract = {{Dopamine (DA) modulates the response of the amygdala. However, the
   relation between dopaminergic neurotransmission in striatal and
   extrastriatal brain regions and amygdala reactivity to affective stimuli
   has not yet been established. To address this issue, we measured DA
   D2/D3 receptor (DRD2/3) availability in twenty-eight healthy men
   (nicotine-dependent smokers and never-smokers) using positron emission
   tomography with {[}F-18]fallypride. In the same group of participants,
   amygdala response to unpleasant visual stimuli was determined using
   blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance
   imaging. The effects of DRD2/3 availability in emotion-related brain
   regions and nicotine dependence on amygdala response to unpleasant
   stimuli were examined by multiple regression analysis. We observed
   enhanced prefrontal DRD2/3 availability in those individuals with higher
   amygdala response to unpleasant stimuli. As compared to never-smokers,
   smokers showed an attenuated amygdala BOLD response to unpleasant
   stimuli. Thus, individuals with high prefrontal DRD2/3 availability may
   be more responsive toward aversive and stressful information. Through
   this mechanism, dopaminergic neurotransmission might influence
   vulnerability for affective and anxiety disorders. Neuronal reactivity
   to unpleasant stimuli seems to be reduced by smoking. This observation
   could explain increased smoking rates in individuals with mental
   disorders. Hum Brain Mapp 31:716-726,2010. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{There is a large individual deviation for men, which may be caused by a
   difference in personality characteristics, in sexual interest in
   response to sexual stimuli. In this study, we investigate whether
   attention to the sexual region in a video depends on the personality
   characteristics of men, assessing this with an eye-tracking system. The
   study included 30 healthy males with a normal psychological state, who
   viewed a sexual video in which the sexual region had been designated.
   Visual attention was measured across the designated region according to
   gaze duration. Ten types of personality characteristics were evaluated
   as a T-score by a questionnaire. By Pearson's correlation coefficient,
   the relations between gaze duration at the sexual region and T-scores of
   paranoia, psychasthenia and social introversion were found to be
   statistically significant. By multivariate stepwise regression analysis,
   only social introversion was negatively associated with the sexual
   region. Even normal variation of personality characteristics can affect
   the viewing period of the sexual region. This is the first report
   showing that subjects with a high degree of paranoia, psychasthenia and
   particularly social introversion have a tendency to view the sexual
   region for a shorter duration. International Journal of Impotence

Abstract = {{We used event-related fMRI to study two types of retrieval monitoring
   that regulate episodic memory accuracy: diagnostic and disqualifying
   monitoring. Diagnostic monitoring relies on expectations, whereby the
   failure to retrieve expected recollections prevents source memory
   misattributions (sometimes called the distinctiveness heuristic).
   Disqualifying monitoring relies on corroborative evidence, whereby the
   successful recollection of accurate source information prevents
   misattribution to an alternative source (sometimes called recall to
   reject). Using criterial recollection tests, we found that orienting
   retrieval toward distinctive recollections (colored pictures) reduced
   source memory misattributions compared with a control test in which
   retrieval was oriented toward less distinctive recollections (colored
   font). However, the corresponding neural activity depended on the type
   of monitoring engaged on these tests. Rejecting items based on the
   absence of picture recollections (i.e., the distinctiveness heuristic)
   decreased activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex relative to the
   control test, whereas rejecting items based on successful picture
   recollections (i.e., a recall-to-reject strategy) increased activity in
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. There also was some evidence that these
   effects were differentially lateralized. This study provides the first
   neuroimaging comparison of these two recollection-based monitoring
   processes and advances theories of prefrontal involvement inmemory
   retrieval.}},

Abstract = {{This investigation combined behavioral and functional neuroimaging
   measures to explore whether perception of pain is modulated by the
   target's stigmatized status and whether the target bore responsibility
   for that stigma. During fMRI scanning, participants were exposed to a
   series of short video clips featuring age-matched individuals
   experiencing pain who were (a) similar to the participant (healthy), (b)
   stigmatized but not responsible for their stigmatized condition
   (infected with AIDS as a result of an infected blood transfusion), or
   (c) stigmatized and responsible for their stigmatized condition
   (infected with AIDS as a result of intravenous drug use). Explicit pain
   and empathy ratings for the targets were obtained outside of the MRI
   environment, along with a variety of implicit and explicit measures of
   AIDS bias. Results showed that participants were significantly more
   sensitive to the pain of AIDS transfusion targets as compared with
   healthy and AIDS drug targets, as evidenced by significantly higher pain
   and empathy ratings during video evaluation and significantly greater
   hemodynamic activity in areas associated with pain processing (i.e.,
   right anterior insula, anterior midcingulate cortex, periaqueductal
   gray). In contrast, significantly less activity was observed in the
   anterior midcingulate cortex for AIDS drug targets as compared with
   healthy controls. Further, behavioral differences between healthy and
   AIDS drug targets were moderated by the extent to which participants
   blamed AIDS drug individuals for their condition. Controlling for both
   explicit and implicit AIDS bias, the more participants blamed these
   targets, the less pain they attributed to them as compared with healthy
   controls. The present study reveals that empathic resonance is moderated
   early in information processing by a priori attitudes toward the target

Abstract = {{Purpose: To characterize and evaluate functional and anatomic changes of
   visual pathway lesions during hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment with
   blood-oxygenation-level-dependent functional MRI (BOLD-fMRI) and
   diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).
   Materials and Methods: Sixteen patients with visual pathway lesions
   received HBO treatment. Both BOLD-fMRI and DTI were performed before and
   after the treatment, while 12 healthy subjects were also studied with 2
   examinations as control. The t-tests were used for the comparison of
   number of activated voxels (AVs) and fractional anisotropy (FA) between
   the two groups, and within the patient group before and after HBO
   treatment. Visual acuity of the patient group before and after the
   treatment was compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
   Results: Before the treatment, both AVs (P < 0.01) and FA (P < 0.05) in
   the bilateral cortexes of occipital lobes were significantly less in the
   patient group than in the control group. After the treatment, both AVs
   (P < 0.05) and FA (P < 0.05) were significantly increased. Moreover. The
   FA of 6 patients with lesions in the optical nerve was greater than the
   FA of the other 10 patients with lesions in the optic radiation (P <
   0.05).
   Conclusion: BOLD-fMRI combined with DTI was useful for the
   characterization and evaluation of anatomic and functional changes of
   visual pathway lesions and their development during HBO treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Background: In spite of many similarities in the psychopathology of
   anorexia nervosa W (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN), the 2 groups seem to
   differ in terms of body image disturbances. Therefore, the aim of the
   present study was to compare neuronal correlates of viewing photographs
   of one's own body and another woman's body in patients with these forms
   of eating disorders as well as controls. Methods: We performed
   functional magnetic resonance imaging while women with AN (n = 13), BN
   (n = 15) and healthy controls (n = 27) viewed in standardized pictures
   of their own body and another woman's body, taken while the participants
   were wearing a bikini. Results: When viewing their own body,
   participants with AN and BN showed reduced activity in the inferior
   parietal lobule compared with healthy women. In response to looking at
   another woman's body, participants with AN had higher amygdala activity
   than did those in the BN and control groups. Limitations: The
   generalizability of the results is limited by the small sample size.
   Conclusion: Our data suggest decreased attentional processes in AN and
   BN toward one's own body, possibly reflecting body-related avoidance
   behaviour. Enhanced limbic activity elicited by looking at another
   woman's body in participants with AN might be a neural correlate of
   stronger emotional activation and enhanced vigilance, possibly resulting
   from social comparison processes. Our study reveals hints about body
   image-associated alterations in brain activity, which seem to be more
   pronounced among women with AN than among those with BN.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Patients with schizophrenia frequently have deficits in
   social cognition, and difficulties in the discrimination of emotional
   facial expressions have been discussed as an important contributing
   factor. We investigated whether this impairment is aggravated by
   difficulties relating the observed facial expression to contextual
   information, as is often provided by emotionally valence, crossmodal
   stimulation. Methods: We investigated the effects of odorant primes on
   the accuracy and speed of emotional face recognition. Healthy controls
   and patients with schizophrenia were exposed to Thee second odorant
   stimuli: vanillin W pleasanta, ambient air W neutrala and hydrogen
   sulfide W unpleasanta. The odours were followed by an emotional face
   recognition task. in which participants determined if a face showed
   happinessd disgust or neutral affect. Results: Controls showed improved
   performance in the categorization of disgusted faces after all types of
   odour stimulation irrespective of the emotional valence. Howeverd in
   controlsd the response time for happy faces was slower after
   presentation of any odourf Schizophrenia patients showed an attenuated
   effect of olfactory priming on disgust recognitiond which resulted in
   the increased performance differences between the groupsf This effect
   was particularly strong for the unpleasant odourf Limitations: The study
   design did not allow us to fully differentiate between the effects of
   perceived odour intensity and valencef y possible contribution of
   cognitive deficits on the observed effects should be investigated in
   future studies. Conclusion: Our results provide novel evidence for a
   special connection between the presentation of odorant cues and the
   accuracy of recognition of disgusted faces in healthy controls. This
   recognition advantage is disturbed in patients with schizophrenia and
   appears to contribute to the observed deficit in emotional face
   recognition.}},

Abstract = {{Self-referential processing involves a complex set of cognitive
   functions, posing challenges to delineating its independent neural
   correlates. While self-referential processing has been considered
   functionally intertwined with episodic memory, the present study
   explores their overlap and dissociability.
   Standard tasks for self-referential processing and episodic memory were
   combined into a single fMRI experiment. Contrasting the effects of
   self-relatedness and retrieval success allowed for the two processes to
   be delineated.
   Stimuli judged as self-referential specifically activated the posterior
   cingulate/anterior precuneus, the medial prefrontal cortex, and an
   inferior division of the inferior parietal lobule. In contrast, episodic
   memory retrieval specifically involved the posterior precuneus, the
   right anterior prefrontal cortex, and a superior division of the
   inferior parietal lobule (extending into superior parietal lobule).
   Overlapping activations were found in intermediate zones in the
   precuneus and the inferior parietal lobule, but not in the prefrontal
   cortex.
   While our data show common networks for both processes in the medial and
   lateral parietal cortex, three functional differentiations were also
   observed: (1) an anterior-posterior differentiation within the medial
   parietal cortex; (2) a medial-anterolateral differentiation within the
   prefrontal cortex; and, (3) an inferior-superior differentiation within
   the lateral parietal cortex for self-referential processing versus
   episodic memory retrieval. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperative social interaction is critical for human social development
   and learning. Despite the importance of social interaction, previous
   neuroimaging studies lack two fundamental components of everyday
   face-to-face interactions: contingent responding and joint attention. In
   the current studies, functional MRI data were collected while
   participants interacted with a human experimenter face-to-face via live
   video feed as they engaged in simple cooperative games. In Experiment 1,
   participants engaged in a live interaction with the experimenter
   ({''}Live{''}) or watched a video of the same interaction
   ({''}Recorded{''}). During the ``Live{''} interaction, as compared to
   the Recorded conditions, greater activation was seen in brain regions
   involved in social cognition and reward, including the right
   temporoparietal junction (rTPJ), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), right
   superior temporal sulcus (rSTS), ventral striatum, and amygdala.
   Experiment 2 isolated joint attention, a critical component of social
   interaction. Participants either followed the gaze of the live
   experimenter to a shared target of attention ({''}Joint Attention{''})
   or found the target of attention alone while the experimenter was
   visible but not sharing attention ({''}Solo Attention{''}). The right
   temporoparietal junction and right posterior STS were differentially
   recruited during Joint, as compared to Solo, attention. These findings
   suggest the rpSTS and rTPJ are key regions for both social interaction
   and joint attention. This method of allowing online, contingent social
   interactions in the scanner could open up new avenues of research in
   social cognitive neuroscience, both in typical and atypical populations.

Abstract = {{Prior neuroimaging research has implicated regions within and near the
   posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) in the visual processing of
   biological motion and of the intentions implied by specific movements.
   However, it is unknown whether this region is engaged during the
   processing of human motion at a conceptual level, such as during story
   comprehension. Here, we obtained functional magnetic resonance images
   from subjects reading brief stories that described a human character's
   background and then concluded with an action or decision made by the
   character. Half of the stories contained incidental descriptions of
   biological motion (such as the character's walking or grasping) while
   the remaining half did not. As a second factor, the final action of the
   story was either congruent or incongruent with the character's
   background and implied goals and intentions. Stories that contained
   biological motion strongly activated the pSTS bilaterally, along with
   ventral temporal areas, premotor cortex, left motor cortex, and the
   precuneus. Active regions of pSTS in individual subjects closely
   overlapped with regions identified with a separate biological motion
   localizer (point-light display) task. Reading incongruent versus
   congruent stories activated dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and
   bilateral anterior insula. These results support the hypothesis that
   reading can engage higher visual cortex in a content-specific manner,
   and suggest that the presence of biological motion should be controlled
   as a potential confound in fMRI studies using story comprehension tasks.

Abstract = {{Cognitive reappraisal is a commonly used and highly adaptive strategy
   for emotion regulation that has been studied in healthy volunteers. Most
   studies to date have focused on forms of reappraisal that involve
   reinterpreting the meaning of stimuli and have intermixed social and
   non-social emotional stimuli. Here we examined the neural correlates of
   the regulation of negative emotion elicited by social situations using a
   less studied form of reappraisal known as distancing. Whole brain fMRI
   data were obtained as participants viewed aversive and neutral social
   scenes with instructions to either simply look at and respond naturally
   to the images or to downregulate their emotional responses by
   distancing. Three key findings were obtained accompanied with the
   reduced aversive response behaviorally. First, across both instruction
   types, aversive social images activated the amygdala. Second, across
   both image types, distancing activated the precuneus and posterior
   cingulate cortex (PCC), intraparietal sulci (IPS), and middle/superior
   temporal gyrus (M/STG). Third, when distancing one's self from aversive
   images, activity increased in dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC), medial
   prefrontal cortex (mPFC), lateral prefrontal cortex, precuneus and PCC,
   IPS, and M/STG, meanwhile, and decreased in the amygdala. These findings
   demonstrate that distancing from aversive social cues modulates amygdala
   activity via engagement of networks implicated in social perception,
   perspective-taking, and attentional allocation. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Recent functional imaging studies suggest key involvement of medial
   prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in processes of self-evaluation. Additional
   behavioral evidence suggests significant sex differences in sensitivity
   both to social norms and to information about one's own body,
   particularly as it pertains to assessments of self-worth. Because these
   observed sex differences are hypothesized to arise from differences in
   cognitive representations of the self, brain activation differences in
   mPFC might likewise be expected while men and women process information
   about body image. In this study, 10 females and nine males viewed images
   of gender-matched bodies of either an overweight body type or a thin
   body type while undergoing functional MRI (fMRI) scanning. While viewing
   these images, participants were instructed to make evaluations of their
   own bodies in relation to the images displayed. Significant within-group
   contrasts in mPFC activation were observed for women only, with
   relatively higher activation for overweight images versus thin images.
   Men showed no significant mPFC activation while processing either type
   of image. These results are consistent with cognitive models of
   self-representation, particularly those developed within social and
   cultural theoretical frameworks, where body size is hypothesized to play
   a dominant role in schematic representations of self-worth for many
   women. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ostracism threatens fundamental needs of belonging, self-esteem,
   control, and meaningful existence, which should motivate participants to
   respond to this threat. However, research has yet to examine the role of
   need threat in producing motivation after ostracism. In the current
   work, participants completed a ``cognitive ability{''} (antisaccade)
   task following Cyberball-induced ostracism or inclusion. In two
   experiments, it was found that when ostracized, participants do not see
   antisaccade performance as a means of responding to the concerns
   produced by need threat; they respond only to the social threat, leading
   to worse performance than included participants (Experiments I and 2).
   However, when participants see an avenue of response (the Cyberball
   players can compare antisaccade performances), ostracized participants
   outperform included participants (Experiment 2). Moreover, this effect
   was mediated by the need for belonging, suggesting that ostracized
   participants were motivated to elevate their inclusionary status by
   demonstrating their worth on the cognitive ability task.}},

Title = {{Do inter-regional gray-matter volumetric correlations reflect altered

Abstract = {{Background: Schizophrenia patients and their relatives show aberrant
   functional connectivity in default network regions (DRs) such as the
   medial prefrontal. lateral temporal, cingulate and inferior parietal
   cortices and executive regions such as the dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex (DLPFC). Gray-matter volumetric alterations may be related to
   these functional connectivity deficits. Also, gray-matter volume
   inter-regional correlations may reflect altered inter-regional
   functional connectivity.
   Aims: To examine our prediction of alterations of gray-matter volumes
   and inter-regional volume correlations for DRs and the DLPFC in
   offspring of schizophrenia patients (OS).
   Methods: We assessed 64 adolescent and young adult OS and 80 healthy
   controls (HC) using T1-MRI. Regional gray-matter volumes and
   inter-regional volume correlations between the DRs and between the DLPFC
   and DRs on each side were compared across groups.
   Results: Compared to HC, OS had reductions in several DRs and the DLPFC
   after controlling age, gender, and intra-cranial volume, and correcting
   for multiple comparisons. OS had stronger (more positive) gray-matter
   volume inter-correlations between DRs and between DRs and the DLPFC.
   Conclusions: Volumetric deficits in the default network and in the DLPFC
   may be related to familial diathesis in schizophrenia and to functional
   connectivity abnormalities in those at familial risk. Increased
   inter-correlations between DRs and between DR and DLPFC gray-matter
   volumes may serve as surrogate indices of abnormal functional
   connectivity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Comprehension of other persons' mental states is one of the
   representative cognitive functions involved in social situations. It has
   been suggested that this function sometimes recruits emotional
   processes. The present fMRI study examined the neural mechanisms
   associated with understanding others' mental states, and the conditions
   that determine the recruitment of the emotional processes. The false
   belief paradigm, a traditional behavioral paradigm to investigate
   comprehension of others, was applied to an event-related fMRI analysis,
   allowing for the extraction of brain activity time-locked to successful
   understanding of others' mental states. Prominent brain activity was
   observed in multiple cortical regions including the medial prefrontal
   cortex, temporo-parietal junction, precuneus, and temporal pole. Then,
   correlational analyses were performed between the activations and
   individuals' scores of neuroticism, a personality trait that reflects
   emotional instability in daily life. It was revealed that the
   neuroticism scores were positively correlated with the activity in the
   temporal pole region, but not in the other regions. These results
   suggest that the emotional processes implemented in the temporal pole
   are recruited during successful understanding of other persons' mental
   states, and that the recruitment may be modulated by an emotional
   personality trait of individual subjects. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{How do we ignore stimuli that are salient but irrelevant when our task
   is to select a lower salient stimulus? Since bottom-up processes favor
   high saliency, detection of a low-salient target in the presence of
   highly salient distractors requires top-down attentional guidance.
   Previous studies have demonstrated that top-down attention can modulate
   perceptual processing and also that the control of attention is driven
   by frontoparietal regions. However, to date, there is no direct evidence
   on the cause and effect relationship between control regions and
   perceptual processing. Here, we report the first evidence demonstrating
   a neural circuit for the downregulation of salient distractors when a
   low-salient target is selected, combining brain imaging using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging with brain stimulation by transcranial
   magnetic stimulation. Using these combined techniques, we were able to
   identify a cause and effect relationship in the suppression of saliency,
   based on an interaction between the left intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and
   a region implicated in visual processing in our task (the left occipital
   pole). In particular, low-salient stimuli were selected by the left IPS
   suppressing early visual areas that would otherwise respond to a
   high-saliency distractor in the task. Apart from providing a first
   documentation of the neural circuit supporting selection by saliency,
   these data can be critical for understanding the underlying causes of
   problems in ignoring irrelevant salience that are found in both acquired
   and neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., attention deficit/hyperactivity
   disorder or autism).}},

Abstract = {{When another person takes 10 pound from your hand, it matters if they
   are a shopkeeper or a robber. That is, the meaning of a simple,
   goal-directed action can vary depending on the identity of the actors
   involved. Research examining action understanding has identified an
   action observation network (AON) that encodes action features such as
   goals and kinematics. However, it is not yet known how or where the
   brain links actor identity to action goal. In the present paper, we used
   a repetition suppression paradigm during functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) to examine the neural representation of actor identity
   within the context of object-directed actions. Participants watched
   video clips of two different actors with two different object-goals.
   Repeated presentation of the same actor suppressed the blood oxygen
   level-dependent (BOLD) response in fusiform gyrus and occipitotemporal
   cortex. In contrast, repeated presentation of an action with the same
   object-goal suppressed the BOLD response throughout the AON. Our data
   reveal an extended brain network for understanding other people and
   their everyday actions that go beyond the traditional action observation
   network. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Japanese and Chinese both share the same ideographic/logographic
   character system. How these characters are processed, however, is
   inherently different for each language. We harnessed the unique property
   of homophone judgment in Japanese kanji to provide an analogous Chinese
   condition using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) in 33 native Japanese speakers. We compared two types of kanji:
   (I) kanji that usually evokes only one pronunciation to Japanese
   speakers, which is representative of most Chinese characters (monophonic
   character); (2) kanji that evoked multiple pronunciation candidates,
   which is typical in Japanese kanji (heterophonic character). Results
   showed that character pairs with multiple sound possibilities increased
   activation in posterior regions of the left, middle and inferior frontal
   gyri (MFG and IFG), the bilateral anterior insulae, and the left
   anterior cingulate cortex as compared with those of kanji with only one
   sound. The activity seen in the MFG, dorsal IFG, and ventral IFG in the

   correspond with language components of orthography, phonology, and
   semantics, respectively, was discussed in regards to their potentially
   important roles in information selection among competing Sources of the
   components. A comparison with previous studies suggested that detailed
   analyses of activation in these language areas could explain differences
   between Japanese and Chinese, such as a greater involvement of the
   prefrontal language production regions for Japanese, whereas, for
   Chinese there is more phonological processing of inputs in the superior
   temporal gyrus. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{While neuroimaging studies implicate medial rostral prefrontal cortex
   (mrPFC) in self-referential processing, simulation accounts of social
   cognition suggest that this region also supports thinking about other
   people. This study tested the prediction that mrPFC might be involved in
   appraising the personality traits of another person to the degree that
   this person is perceived as similar to oneself. We also examined whether
   recruiting common processes for thinking about oneself and others might
   impact on subsequent memory for those judgments. Functional MRI was used
   while two factors were crossed: (i) the requirement to engage in
   personality trait or episodic Source memory judgments and (ii) the
   reference for these judgments (i.e., oneself or a friend). The results
   link haemodynamic changes in mrPFC to both personality judgments about
   oneself and subsequent episodic memory retrieval of these judgments. The
   degree to which BOLD signal in this region was also associated with
   thinking about others correlated with perceived similarity in both
   tasks, thus corroborating simulation accounts. Moreover, participants
   who perceived themselves as having similar traits to their friends
   tended to be poorer at remembering whether they had made trait judgments
   in reference to themselves or their friend. This behavioral effect was
   reflected in the BOLD signal in mrPFC: there was a positive correlation
   between signal change for self versus friend judgments and subsequent
   memory for the reference of such judgments. he results suggest that
   investigations Of MrPFC activity in the context of self/other judgments
   should take into account this psychological similarity effect. (C) 2010

Volume = {{3}},

Pages = {{53-67}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The social motivation hypothesis of autism posits that infants with
   autism do not experience social stimuli as rewarding, thereby leading to
   a cascade of potentially negative consequences for later development.
   While possible downstream effects of this hypothesis such as altered
   face and voice processing have been examined, there has not been a
   direct investigation of social reward processing in autism. Here we use
   functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine social and monetary
   rewarded implicit learning in children with and without autism spectrum
   disorders (ASD). Sixteen males with ASD and sixteen age- and IQ-matched
   typically developing (TO) males were scanned while performing two
   versions of a rewarded implicit learning task. In addition to examining
   responses to reward, we investigated the neural circuitry supporting
   rewarded learning and the relationship between these factors and social
   development. We found diminished neural responses to both social and
   monetary rewards in ASD, with a pronounced reduction in response to
   social rewards (SR). Children with ASD also demonstrated a further
   deficit in frontostriatal response during social, but not monetary,
   rewarded learning. Moreover, we show a relationship between ventral
   striatum activity and social reciprocity in TD children. Together, these
   data support the hypothesis that children with ASD have diminished
   neural responses to SR, and that this deficit relates to social learning
   impairments.}},

Abstract = {{Person recognition can be accomplished through several modalities (face,
   name, voice). Lesion. neurophysiology and neuroimaging studies have been
   conducted in ail attempt to determine the similarities and differences
   in the neural networks associated with person identity via different
   modality inputs. The Current study used event-related functional-MRI in
   17 healthy participants to directly compare activation in response to
   randomly presented famous and non-famous names and faces (25 stimuli in
   each of the four categories). Findings indicated distinct areas of
   activation that differed for faces and names in regions typically
   associated with pre-semantic perceptual processes. In contrast,
   overlapping brain regions were activated in areas associated with the
   retrieval of biographical knowledge and associated social affective
   features. Specifically, activation for famous faces was primarily right
   lateralized and famous names were left-lateralized. However, for both
   stimuli, similar areas of bilateral activity were observed in the early
   phases of perceptual processing. Activation for fame, irrespective of
   stimulus modality, activated ail extensive left hemisphere network, with
   bilateral activity observed in the hippocampi, posterior cingulate, and
   middle temporal gyri. Findings are discussed within the framework of
   recent proposals concerning the neural network of person identification.

Abstract = {{One influential account asserts that the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) is
   a domain-general hub for semantic memory. Other evidence indicates it is
   part of a domain-specific social cognition system. Arbitrating these
   accounts using functional magnetic resonance imaging has previously been
   difficult because of magnetic susceptibility artifacts in the region.
   The present study used parameters optimized for imaging the ATL, and had
   subjects encode facts about unfamiliar people, buildings, and hammers.
   Using both conjunction and region of interest analyses, person-selective
   responses were observed in both the left and right ATL. Neither
   building-selective, hammer-selective nor domain-general responses were
   observed in the ATLs, although they were observed in other brain
   regions. These findings were supported by ``resting-state{''} functional
   connectivity analyses using independent datasets from the same subjects.
   Person-selective ATL clusters were functionally connected with the
   brain's wider social cognition network. Rather than serving as a
   domain-general semantic hub, the ATLs work in unison with the social
   cognition system to support learning facts about others.}},

Abstract = {{Uncertainty about potential negative future outcomes can cause stress
   and is a central feature of anxiety disorders. The stress and anxiety
   associated with uncertain situations may lead individuals to
   overestimate the frequency with which uncertain cues are followed by
   negative outcomes, an example of covariation bias. Using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging, we found that uncertainty-related
   expectations modulated neural responses to aversion. Insula and amygdala
   responses to aversive pictures were larger after an uncertain cue (that
   preceded aversive or neutral pictures) than a certain cue (that always
   preceded aversive pictures). Anticipatory anterior cingulate cortex
   (ACC) activity elicited by the cues was inversely associated with the
   insula and amygdala responses to aversive pictures following the cues.
   Nearly 75\% of subjects overestimated the frequency of aversive pictures
   following uncertain cues, and ACC and insula activity predicted this
   uncertainty-related covariation bias. Findings provide the first
   evidence of the brain mechanisms of covariation bias and highlight the
   temporal dynamics of ACC, insula, and amygdala recruitment for
   processing aversion in the context of uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{While the ecological validity of virtual reality (VR) applications is
   usually assessed by behavioral data or interrogation, an alternative
   approach on a neuronal level is offered by brain imaging methods.
   Because it is yet unclear if 3D space in virtual environments is
   processed analogically to the real world, we conducted a study
   investigating virtual spatial processing in the brain using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Results show differences in VR
   spatial brain processing as compared to known brain activations in
   reality. Identifying differences and commonalities of brain processing
   in VR reveals limitations and holds important implications for VR
   therapy and training tools. When VR therapy aims at the rehabilitation
   of brain function and activity, differences in brain processing have to
   be taken into account for designing effective VR training tools.
   Furthermore, for an evaluation of possible restoration effects caused by
   VR training, it is necessary to integrate information about the brain
   activation networks elicited by the training. The present study provides
   an example for demonstrating the benefit of fMRI as an evaluation tool
   for the mental processes involved in virtual environments.}},

Abstract = {{We report two studies aimed at investigating the effects of distinct
   negative emotions on pairwise economic interactions. In the ultimatum
   game, a proposer offers a division of a sum of money to a responder who
   decides whether to accept the split, or reject and leave both players
   with nothing. In Experiment 1, we investigated whether induced disgust,
   as compared to sadness and neutral emotion. specifically influences
   responders' decisions to reject unfair proposals. In Experiment 2, we
   assessed whether the effects of disgust were selectively related to
   social contexts by contrasting interactions with a human partner with
   those involving a computer. Results showed that relative to being in a
   sad or neutral mood, induced feelings of disgust significantly increased
   rejection rates of unfair offers. Moreover, we found that when the
   partner was not responsible for the fairness violation, such as in the
   computer-offer condition, the disgust induction failed to affect
   participants' choices, We conclude by focusing on the hypothesis that
   disgust and social norm violations may share common computational
   components, both at a psychological and a neural level.}},

Abstract = {{Memory problems are one of the most common symptoms of sport-related
   mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), known as concussion. Surprisingly,
   little research has examined spatial memory in concussed athletes given
   its importance in athletic environments. Here, we combine functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a virtual reality (VR) paradigm
   designed to investigate the possibility of residual functional deficits
   in recently concussed but asymptomatic individuals. Specifically, we
   report performance of spatial memory navigation tasks in a VR
   environment and fMRI data in 15 athletes suffering from MTBI and 15
   neurologically normal, athletically active age matched controls. No
   differences in performance were observed between these two groups of
   subjects in terms of success rate (94 and 92\%) and time to complete the
   spatial memory navigation tasks (mean = 19.5 and 19.7 s). Whole brain
   analysis revealed that similar brain activation patterns were observed
   during both encoding and retrieval among the groups. However, concussed
   athletes showed larger cortical networks with additional increases in
   activity outside of the shared region of interest (ROI) during encoding.
   Quantitative analysis of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal
   revealed that concussed individuals had a significantly larger cluster
   size during encoding at parietal cortex, right dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex, and right hippocampus. In addition, there was a significantly
   larger BOLD signal percent change at the right hippocampus. Neither
   cluster size nor BOLD signal percent change at shared ROIs was different
   between groups during retrieval. These major findings are discussed with
   respect to current hypotheses regarding the neural mechanism responsible
   for alteration of brain functions in a clinical setting.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to recognise one's own face is crucial for self-identity
   formation and it plays a key role in the development of social
   interactions. Our starting hypothesis was that own-face recognition may
   be a psychophysiological phenomenon capable of activating the vegetative
   system in a peculiar manner, via sympathetic pathways. To test this
   hypothesis we studied the sympathetic skin responses (SSRs) evoked in 18
   healthy subjects by the image of their own faces and by six other
   different visual stimuli. The SSRs were enhanced when participants were
   shown their own faces. Both SSR area and SSR amplitude contributed to
   this phenomenon.
   This work may offer new insights into the psychophysiological processes
   involved in own-face recognition; moreover, the SSR could be a useful
   tool for future studies of patients affected by neuropsychiatric
   disorders presenting impairment of own-face recognition or
   representation of self-identity.}},

Abstract = {{The experience of being liked is a key social event and fundamental to
   motivating human behavior, though little is known about its neural
   underpinnings. In this study, we examined the experience of being liked
   in a group of 15- to 24-year-old: a cohort for whom forming friendships
   has a great degree of salience, and for whom the explicit representation
   of relationships is familiar from their frequent use of social
   networking technologies. Study participants (n = 19) were led to believe
   that other participants had formed an opinion on their likability based
   on their appearance in a photograph, and during fMRI scanning viewed the
   photographs of people who had purportedly responded favorably to them
   (alongside photographs of control participants). Results indicated that
   being liked activated primary reward- and self-related regions,
   including the nucleus accumbens, midbrain (in an area corresponding to
   the ventral tegmentum), ventromedial prefrontal cortex, posterior
   cingulate cortex (including retrosplenial cortex), amygdala, and
   insula/opercular cortex. Participants showed greater activation of
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala in response to being liked
   by people that they regarded highly compared to those they regarded less
   so. Finally, being liked by the opposite compared to the same gender
   activated the right caudal orbitofrontal cortex and right anterior
   insula: areas important for the representation of primary somatic
   rewards. This study demonstrates that neural response to being liked has
   features that are consistent with response to other rewarding events,
   but it has additional features that reflect its intrinsically

Abstract = {{Objective: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a prevalent and
   debilitating psychiatric condition of adolescence. Two effective forms
   of treatment are cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and selective
   serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). This pilot study examined changes
   in brain function following each type of treatment in GAD.
   Method: Subjects were 14 youths with GAD (7 had CBT, 7 received
   fluoxetine) and 10 age- and gender-matched healthy peers. Functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans were acquired before and after
   treatment for patients and over two comparable time points for controls.
   During fMRI acquisition, a probe detection task with emotional (angry,
   happy) and neutral faces allowed for assessment of neural response to
   threat. Following previous research, region of interest analyses were
   performed in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC).
   Results: fMRI results showed increased right VLPFC activation, relative
   to controls, in the medication (t(15) = 3.01, p < 0.01) and CBT (t(15) =
   3.22, p < 0.01) groups following treatment.
   Conclusions: This study shows significant increase in right VLPFC
   activation in response to angry faces following treatment with CBT or
   fluoxetine for GAD. This is consistent with previous research indicating
   that the VLPFC may facilitate effective responding to underlying neural
   correlates of anxiety in other brain regions, such as the amygdala.}},

Abstract = {{Human behaviors are motivated not only by materialistic rewards but also
   by abstract social rewards, such as the approval of others. When
   choosing an action in social situations, to evaluate each action, the
   brain must convert different types of reward (such as money or social
   approval) into a common scale. Here using fMRI, we investigated the
   neural correlates of such valuation computations while individuals
   freely decided whether to donate to real charities or to take the money
   for themselves in the presence or absence of observers. Behavioral
   evidence showed that the mere presence of observers increased donation
   rates, and neuroimaging results revealed that activation in the ventral
   striatum before the same choice ({''}donate{''} or ``not donate{''}) was
   significantly modulated by the presence of observers. Particularly high
   striatal activations were observed when a high social reward was
   expected (donation in public) and when there was the potential for
   monetary gain without social cost (no donation in the absence of
   observers). These findings highlight the importance of this area in
   representing both social and monetary rewards as a ``decision
   utility{''} and add to the understanding of how the brain makes a choice
   using a ``common neural currency{''} in social situations.}},

   portions of the human planum temporale (PT) relative to nonspatial
   stimuli such as pitch changes or complex acoustic patterns. However,
   previous work has suggested that the PT may be sensitive to another kind
   of nonspatial variable, namely, the number of auditory objects
   simultaneously presented in the acoustic signal. The goal of the present
   fMRI experiment was to assess whether any portion of the PT showed
   spatial selectivity relative to manipulations of the number of auditory
   objects presented. Spatially sensitive regions in the PT were defined by
   comparing activity associated with listening to an auditory object
   (speech from a single talker) that changed location with one that
   remained stationary. Activity within these regions was then examined
   during a nonspatial manipulation: increasing the number of objects
   (talkers) from one to three. The nonspatial manipulation modulated
   activity within the ``spatial{''} PT regions. No region within the PT
   was found to be selective for spatial or object processing. We suggest
   that previously documented spatial sensitivity in the PT reflects
   auditory source separation using spatial cues rather than spatial
   processing per se.}},

Pages = {{23-41}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{According to a widespread view, a complete explanatory reduction of all
   aspects of the human mind to the electro-chemical functioning of the
   brain is at hand and will certainly produce vast and positive cultural,
   political and social consequences. However, notwithstanding the
   astonishing advances generated by the neurosciences in recent years for
   our understanding of the mechanisms and functions of the brain, the
   application of these findings to the specific but crucial issue of human
   agency can be considered a ``pre-paradigmatic science{''} (in Thomas
   Kuhn's sense). This implies that the situation is, at the same time,
   intellectually stimulating and methodologically confused. More
   specifically-because of the lack of a solid, unitary and coherent
   methodological framework as to how to connect neurophysiology and
   agency-it frequently happens that tentative approaches, bold but very
   preliminary claims and even clearly flawed interpretations of
   experimental data are taken for granted. In this article some examples
   of such conceptual confusions and intellectual hubris will be presented,
   which derive from the most recent literature at the intersection between
   neurosciences, on the one hand, and philosophy, politics and social
   sciences, on the other hand. It will also be argued that, in some of
   these cases, hasty and over-ambitious conclusions may produce negative
   social and political consequences. The general upshot will be that very
   much has still to be clarified as to what and how neurosciences can tell
   us about human agency and that, in the meantime, intellectual and
   methodological caution is to be recommended.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Joshua Greene has argued that several lines of empirical research,
   including his own fMRI studies of brain activity during moral
   decision-making, comprise strong evidence against the legitimacy of
   deontology as a moral theory. This is because, Greene maintains, the
   empirical studies establish that ``characteristically deontological{''}
   moral thinking is driven by prepotent emotional reactions which are not
   a sound basis for morality in the contemporary world, while
   ``characteristically consequentialist{''} thinking is a more reliable
   moral guide because it is characterized by greater cognitive command and
   control. In this essay, I argue that Greene does not succeed in drawing
   a strong statistical or causal connection between prepotent emotional
   reactions and deontological theory, and so does not undermine the
   legitimacy of deontological moral theories. The results that Greene
   relies on from neuroscience and social psychology do not establish his
   conclusion that consequentialism is superior to deontology.}},

Abstract = {{We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a naturalistic
   joint attention scenario to evaluate two, alternative hypotheses
   concerning the social brain. The first, Content Specific Attribution
   hypothesis, was that core regions previously identified as being
   involved in social cognition also participate in representing the
   contents of another mind. The second, Dual Role hypothesis, was that
   extrastriate, category-specific visual regions respond to a visible
   stimulus of a specific category and to the same stimulus occluded, but
   when it appears to be the focus of another person's visual attention.
   Participants viewed category-specific stimuli (Place and Body images) to
   localize the extrastriate body area (EBA) and parahippocampal place area
   (PPA). Then, they observed a computerized character viewing each
   stimulus category, occluded from the participant's view. In support of
   the Content Specific Attribution hypothesis, whole-brain analyses
   revealed that viewing someone else looking at an occluded picture of a
   body activated brain regions previously associated with components of
   social cognition more than viewing someone else looking at an occluded
   picture of a place. Counter to the Dual Role hypothesis, functional
   region of interest (ROI) analyses revealed that the EBA and PPA were not
   clearly involved in representing what the character was seeing. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging investigations of self-processing have generally focused on
   the neural correlates of explicit self-reflection. However, very little
   is known about the neural basis of implicit self-related processes. We
   utilized the concept of self-schemas to construct a two-task fMRI study
   that elicited both implicit and explicit self-relevant processes. The
   sample consisted of 18 participants who were schematic for either
   athletics or science. In the implicit self-relevance task, individuals
   made don-self-relevant judgments about affectively neutral scientific
   and athletic images. In the explicit self-reference task, participants
   judged the self-descriptiveness of adjectives related to athletics or
   science. Implicit and explicit processing of self-relevant (schematic)
   material elicited activity in many of the same regions, including medial
   prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate/precuneus, ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex, subgenual anterior cingulate, amygdala, and ventral
   striatum. We suggest that processing self-related material recruits
   similar neural networks regardless of whether the self-relevance is made

   subsequent retrieval of these words. The right supramarginal gyrus and
   left middle frontal gyrus were involved in situation-based learning and
   text-based learning, respectively, whereas the left inferior frontal
   gyrus was activated when learners used L2 knowledge in a mode different

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies have thoroughly investigated brain regions that are
   recruited when we put ourselves in another person's shoes. Taking a
   third-person perspective (3PP) as opposed to a first-person perspective
   (1PP) has been associated with brain activation in the inferior parietal
   cortex, the medial posterior cortex and the prefrontal cortex. Here we
   investigate for the first time the development of the neural network
   that yields cognitive perspective taking. Twelve adults (aged 25-32
   years) and twelve school-aged children (aged 8-10 years) were
   investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   Behaviorally, we found a decrease of reaction time differences between
   3PP and 1PP with age indicating that adults were more efficient in
   processing a 3PP. Despite the reaction time differences both groups were
   equally accurate in their judgments. Brain imaging data indicated neural
   activity in the left inferior parietal cortex and precuneus for adults
   during 3PP as compared with 1PP judgments. Children additionally showed
   enhanced activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the right
   inferior perietal cortex. We found a significant interaction between
   groups and brain activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   and in the right inferior parietal cortex. These results suggest that
   the development of the ability to reason about another person's mind
   accompanies a shift in activity from frontal to posterior brain regions
   and from bilateral to unilateral left inferior parietal cortex. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Prodigies are individuals with exceptional mental abilities. How is it
   possible that some of these people mentally calculate exponentiations
   with high accuracy and speed? We examined CP, a mental calculation
   prodigy, and a control group of 11 normal calculators for moderate
   mental arithmetic tasks. CP has additionally been tested for
   exceptionally difficult exponentiations. We hypothesized that, if CP
   would activate similar brain regions as controls for both moderate and
   very difficult tasks, his special exceptional abilities could rather be
   explained by neuroplastic changes as a result of obsessive practice than
   by unusual mental strategies and/or neurocognitive mechanisms. For very
   difficult exponentiation tasks, CP showed activation patterns in brain
   regions adjacent to those, which were activated for moderate task
   calculation by both CP and control participants. We concluded,
   therefore, that CP's exceptional calculation performance might rather be
   based on neuroplastic changes substantially caused by years of daily
   hours of training combined with excellent working memory capabilities
   and not on the recruitment of additional brain mechanisms. Furthermore,
   but considering that only one prodigy was compared with a control group,
   results of the present study imply that the neural substrate, which is
   potentially necessary to enhance specific skills dramatically by
   positively motivated excessive mental training, might be present in
   every healthy individual. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The authors investigated whether self-knowledge has a function to reduce
   conflict by biasing one of two choices during occupational choice (e.g.,
   Which occupation do you think you could do better-dancer or chemist). In
   the three experiments, event-related brain potentials were recorded.
   Experiment I revealed that the amplitude of the conflict-related
   negativity (CRN) reflects strength of conflict during occupational
   choice. Results of Experiment 2 demonstrated that the CRN amplitude
   during occupational choice was smaller when self-knowledge was activated
   than when other-knowledge was activated. Experiment 3 showed that the
   CRN amplitude during occupational choice was decreased more when
   self-knowledge that biases one choice of occupation was activated than
   when self-knowledge that does not bias was activated. These results
   suggest that self-knowledge reduces conflict by biasing one of multiple
   choices in situations where two or more possible correct answers can be
   given.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Previous correlational studies have indirectly linked
   dysfunctional dopaminergic neurotransmission to age-related cognitive
   deficits and associated reductions in task-induced functional brain
   activity.
   Methods: We used an experimental-pharmacological functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) approach to more directly examine the role of
   dopamine in neurocognitive aging. Twenty younger and 20 healthy older
   adults were included. During fMRI scanning, a spatial working memory
   (SWM) task was administered under two conditions, varying in cognitive
   load. Positron emission tomography measurements with the D1 receptor
   antagonist {[}(11)C]SCH23390 confirmed that a given experimental dose of
   unlabeled solution occupied 50\% of D1 receptors in younger adults.
   Results: An age-related reduction in SWM performance was observed, and
   fMRI data revealed that, relative to younger adults under placebo
   conditions, elderly persons under-recruited load-sensitive
   fronto-parietal regions during SWM. Critically, in younger adults, the
   D1 antagonist resulted in a similar reduction in SWM performance and
   fMRI response.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that depletion of dopa mine, whether
   ontogenetically or pharmacologically, results in decreased SWM
   performance as well as reduced load-dependent modulation of the blood
   oxygen level dependent signal in fronto-parietal regions, possibly by
   decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio in relevant neural networks.}},

Abstract = {{Disorders in the autism spectrum are characterized by deficits in social
   and communication skills such as imitation, pragmatic language, theory
   of mind, and empathy. The discovery of the ``mirror neuron system{''}
   (MNS) in macaque monkeys may provide a basis from which to explain some
   of the behavioral dysfunctions seen in individuals with autism spectrum
   disorders (ASD). We studied seven right-handed high-functioning male
   autistic and eight normal subjects (TD group) using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging during observation and execution of hand movements
   compared to a control condition (rest), The between group comparison of
   the contrast {[}observation versus rest] provided evidence of a
   bilateral greater activation of inferior frontal gyrus during
   observation of human motion than during rest for the ASD group than for
   the TD group. This hyperactivation of the pars opercularis (belonging to
   the MNS) during observation of human motion in autistic subjects
   provides strong support for the hypothesis of atypical activity of the
   MNS that may be at the core of the social deficits in autism. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Here we tested two working hypotheses on spatially selective cortical
   activation ({''}neural efficiency{''}) in experts: (i) compared to
   non-athletes, elite karate athletes are characterized by a reduced
   cortical activation during the judgment of karate actions; (ii) compared
   to non-athletes and elite karate athletes, amateur karate athletes are
   characterized by an intermediate cortical activation during the judgment
   of karate actions. Electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded in
   16 elite karate athletes, 15 amateur athletes and 17 non-athletes. They
   observed a series of 120 karate videos. At the end of each video, the
   subjects had to judge the technical/athletic level of the exercise by a
   scale from 0 to 10. The mismatch between their judgment and that of the
   coach indexed the degree of action judgment. The EEG cortical sources
   were estimated by sLORETA. With reference to a pre-stimulus period, the
   power decrease of alpha (8-12 Hz) rhythms during the video indexed the
   cortical activation (event-related desynchronization, ERD). Regarding
   the hypothesis of reduced activity in elite karate athletes, low- and
   high-frequency alpha ERD was less pronounced in dorsal and ``mirror{''}
   pathways in the elite karate athletes than in the non-athletes.
   Regarding the hypothesis of intermediate cortical activity in amateur
   karate athletes, low- and high-frequency alpha ERD was less pronounced
   in dorsal pathways across the non-athletes, the amateur karate athletes,
   and the elite karate athletes. In conclusion, athletes' judgment of
   observed sporting actions is related to less pronounced alpha ERD, as a
   possible index of ``neural efficiency{''} in experts engaged in social

Title = {{Exploring the Relationship Between Depressive and Anxiety Symptoms and

Journal = {{ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{396-403}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background:
   Depressive and anxiety symptoms tend to co-occur with heavy drinking.
   Specifically, their presence may exacerbate the severity and
   intractability of heavy drinking. Similarly, heavy drinking may increase
   the risk for and experience of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Although
   depressive and anxiety symptoms have been significantly correlated with
   alcohol craving in cue-exposure paradigms, physiological responses have
   not always mapped onto emotional responses. Therefore, this study sought
   to examine the role of depressive and anxiety symptoms using a more
   basic science approach, through examining functional brain changes.
   Methods:
   Seventy nontreatment seeking, heavy drinking adults were recruited
   through a college campus (n = 45 men; mean age = 22.8). They completed
   measures of drinking, smoking, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms,
   and a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) cue-exposure
   paradigm.
   Results:
   As hypothesized, depressive symptoms were positively correlated with
   activation during the alcohol (vs. appetitive control) cue in the
   insula, cingulate, ventral tegmentum, striatum, and thalamus
   (cluster-corrected p < 0.05, z = 2.3). Similarly, anxiety symptoms were
   positively correlated with activation during the alcohol (vs. appetitive
   control) cue in the striatum, thalamus, insula, and inferior frontal,
   mid-frontal, and cingulate gyri (cluster-corrected p < 0.05, z = 2.3).
   Conclusions:
   Significant correlations were found between depressive symptoms, anxiety
   symptoms, and differential brain activation in response to an alcohol
   versus an appetitive control cue in an fMRI paradigm. Moreover, the
   pattern of activation mapped onto expected regions. This study strongly
   supports the posited relationships between depressive symptoms, anxiety
   symptoms, and differential brain activation in an alcohol cue-exposure
   paradigm with a sample of heavy drinking adults.}},

Title = {{Disruptions in Functional Network Connectivity During Alcohol
   Intoxicated Driving}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background:
   Driving while under the influence of alcohol is a major public health
   problem whose neural basis is not well understood. In a recently
   published functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study (Meda et
   al., 2009), our group identified 5, independent critical
   driving-associated brain circuits whose inter-regional connectivity was
   disrupted by alcohol intoxication. However, the functional connectivity
   between these circuits has not yet been explored in order to determine
   how these networks communicate with each other during sober and
   alcohol-intoxicated states.
   Methods:
   In the current study, we explored such differences in connections
   between the above brain circuits and driving behavior, under the
   influence of alcohol versus placebo. Forty social drinkers who drove
   regularly underwent fMRI scans during virtual reality driving
   simulations following 2 alcohol doses, placebo and an individualized
   dose producing blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) of 0.10\%.
   Results:
   At the active dose, we found specific disruptions of functional network
   connectivity between the frontal-temporal-basal ganglia and the
   cerebellar circuits. The temporal connectivity between these 2 circuits
   was found to be less correlated (p < 0.05) when driving under the
   influence of alcohol. This disconnection was also associated with an
   abnormal driving behavior (unstable motor vehicle steering).
   Conclusions:
   Connections between frontal-temporal-basal ganglia and cerebellum have
   recently been explored; these may be responsible in part for maintaining
   normal motor behavior by integrating their overlapping motor control
   functions. These connections appear to be disrupted by alcohol
   intoxication, in turn associated with an explicit type of impaired
   driving behavior.}},

Title = {{Elevated Amygdala Activity to Sad Facial Expressions: A State Marker of
   Bipolar but Not Unipolar Depression}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{67}},

Abstract = {{Background: Difficulties in emotion processing and poor social function
   are common to bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD)
   depression, resulting in many BID depressed individuals being
   misdiagnosed with MDD. The amygdala is a key region implicated in
   processing emotionally salient stimuli, including emotional facial
   expressions. It is unclear, however, whether abnormal amygdala activity
   during positive and negative emotion processing represents a persistent
   marker of BD regardless of illness phase or a state marker of depression
   common or specific to BID and MDD depression.
   Methods: Sixty adults were recruited: 15 depressed with BID type 1
   (BDd), 15 depressed with recurrent MDD, 15 with BID in remission (BDr),
   diagnosed with DSM-IV and Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV
   Research Version criteria; and 15 healthy control subjects (HC). Groups
   were age- and gender ratio-matched; patient groups were matched for age
   of illness onset and illness duration; depressed groups were matched for
   depression severity. The BDd were taking more psychotropic medication
   than other patient groups. All individuals participated in three
   separate 3T neuroimaging event-related experiments, where they viewed
   mild and intense emotional and neutral faces of fear, happiness, or
   sadness from a standardized series.
   Results: The BDd-relative to HC, BDr, and MDD-showed elevated left
   amygdala activity to mild and neutral facial expressions in the sad (p <
   .009) but not other emotion experiments that was not associated with
   medication. There were no other significant between-group differences in
   amygdala activity.
   Conclusions: Abnormally elevated left amygdala activity to mild sad and
   neutral faces might be a depression-specific marker in BID but not MDD,
   suggesting different pathophysiologic processes for BD versus MDD
   depression.}},

Abstract = {{The amygdala is consistently implicated in biologically relevant
   learning tasks such as Pavlovian conditioning. In humans, the ability to
   identify individual faces based on the social outcomes they have
   predicted in the past constitutes a critical form of associative
   learning that can be likened to ``social conditioning.{''} To capture
   such learning in a laboratory setting, participants learned about faces
   that predicted negative, positive, or neutral social outcomes.
   Participants reported liking or disliking the faces in accordance with
   their learned social value. During acquisition, we observed differential
   functional magnetic resonance imaging activation across the human
   amygdaloid complex consistent with previous lesion,
   electrophysiological, and functional neuroimaging data. A region of the
   medial ventral amygdala and a region of the dorsal amygdala/substantia
   innominata showed signal increases to both Negative and Positive faces,
   whereas a lateral ventral region displayed a linear representation of
   the valence of faces such that Negative > Positive > Neutral. This
   lateral ventral locus also differed from the dorsal and medial loci in
   that the magnitude of these responses was more resistant to habituation.
   These findings document a role for the human amygdala in social learning
   and reveal coarse regional dissociations in amygdala activity that are
   consistent with previous human and nonhuman animal data.}},

Abstract = {{Brain activation associated with anhedonic depression and co-occurring
   anxious arousal and anxious apprehension was measured by fMRI during
   performance of an emotion word Stroop task. Consistent with EEG
   findings, depression was associated with rightward frontal
   lateralization in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), but only
   when anxious arousal was elevated and anxious apprehension was low.
   Activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) was also reduced for
   depression under the same conditions. In contrast, depression was
   associated with more activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (dorsal
   ACC and rostra! ACC) and the bilateral amygclala. Results imply that
   depression, particularly when accompanied by anxious arousal, may result
   in a failure to implement top-down processing by appropriate brain
   regions (left DLPFC, right IFG) due to increased activation in regions
   associated with responding to emotionally salient information (right
   DLPFC, amygdala).}},

Abstract = {{Recent neuroimaging studies have shown that several brain regions -
   namely, the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), ventral medial prefrontal
   cortex (vmPFC), and the bilateral angular gyrus - are more active during
   resting states than during cognitive tasks (i.e., default mode network).
   Although there is evidence showing that the default mode network is
   associated with unconscious state, it is unclear whether this network is
   associated with unconscious processing when normal human subjects
   perform tasks without awareness. We manipulated the level of conscious
   processing in normal subjects by asking them to perform an implicit and
   an explicit memory task, and analyzed signal changes in the default mode
   network for the stimuli versus baseline in both tasks. The functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis showed that the level of
   activation in regions within this network during the implicit task was
   not significantly different from that during the baseline, except in the
   left angular gyrus and the insula. There was strong deactivation for the
   explicit task when compared with the implicit task in the default mode
   regions, except in the left angular gyrus and the left middle temporal
   gyrus. These data suggest that the activity in the default network is
   sustained and less disrupted when an implicit memory task is performed,
   but is suspended when explicit retrieval is required. These results
   provide evidence that the default mode network is associated with
   unconscious processing when human subjects perform an implicit memory
   task. (c) 2009 Elsevier Srl. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To investigate the functional connectivity (FC) pattern within
   all intrinsic functional organization, including both task-positive
   (TPN) and task-negative (TNN) networks, in major depressive disorder and
   to examine relationships between the involved FCs and clinical variables
   Methods Resting-state FC analyses were used to identify the component
   brain regions of the intrinsic organization and to investigate the FCs
   of the individual component regions in 18 first-episode,
   medication-naive MDD and 20 healthy control Subjects
   Results We found that the intrinsic organization of the depressed group
   recruited mole extensive regions than the control group. All of the
   altered FCs associated with the component regions increased in MDD
   Specifically, in the TPN the increased FCs were primarily located in the
   bilateral lateral prefrontal cortices and the inferior parietal lobes,
   which have been implicated in attention and adaptive control. In the
   TNN. the increased FCs were primarily located in the posterior cingulate
   cortex all the media orbitofrontal cortex, which are involved in
   episodic memory, self-reflection and emotional regulation We also found
   increased anti-correlations between the two networks Additionally. the
   strengths of the FCs associated with the leteral prefrontal cortices
   were found to be correlated with the duration of the depressive episode
   and the HDRS scores in the depressed patients
   Limitations Clinical correlates of these abnormal FCs Should be
   cautiously interpreted due to the small sample size in this Study
   Conclusions Abnormalities in the Intrinsic organization may be all
   underlying basis for the pronounced and prolonged negative bias in

Abstract = {{Background: In addition to their more clinically evident abnormalities
   of social cognition, people with autism spectrum conditions (ASC)
   manifest perturbations of attention and sensory perception which may
   offer insights into the underlying neural abnormalities. Similar
   autistic traits in ASC relatives without a diagnosis suggest a
   continuity between clinically affected and unaffected family members.
   Methods: We applied fMRI in the context of a non-social task of visual
   attention in order to determine whether this continuity persists at the
   level of brain physiology. Results: Both boys with ASC and clinically
   unaffected brothers of people with ASC were impaired at a visual
   divided-attention task demanding conjunction of attributes from rapidly
   and simultaneously presented, spatially disjoint stimuli and suppression
   of spatially intervening distractors. In addition, both groups in
   comparison to controls manifested atypical fronto-cerebellar activation
   as a function of distractor congruence, and the degree of this frontal
   atypicality correlated with psychometric measures of autistic traits in
   ASC and sibs. Despite these resemblances between the ASC and sib groups,
   an exploratory, hypothesis-generating analysis of correlations across
   brain regions revealed a decrease in overall functional correlation only
   in the ASC group and not in the sibs. Conclusions: These results
   establish a neurophysiological correlate of familial susceptibility to
   ASC, and suggest that whilst abnormal time courses of frontal activation
   may reflect processes permissive of autistic brain development, abnormal
   patterns of functional correlation across a wider array of brain regions
   may relate more closely to autism's determinants.}},

Abstract = {{This Study investigated the development of three aspects of linguistic
   prosody in a group of children with Williams syndrome compared to
   typically developing children. The prosodic abilities investigated were:
   (I) the ability to understand and use prosody to make specific words or
   syllables stand out in an utterance (focus); (2) the ability to
   Understand and use prosody to disambiguate complex noun phrases
   (chunking); (3) the ability to understand and use prosody to regulate
   conversational behaviour (turn-end). The data were analysed using a
   cross-sectional developmental trajectory approach. The results showed
   that, relative to chronological age, there was a delayed onset in the
   development of the ability of children with WS to use prosody to signal
   the most important word in an utterance (the focus function). Delayed
   rate of development was found for all the other aspects of expressive
   and receptive prosody under investigation. However, when nonverbal
   mental age was taken into consideration, there were no differences
   between the children with WS and the controls neither with the onset nor
   with the rate of development for any of the prosodic skills under
   investigation apart from the ability to use prosody in order to regulate
   conversational behaviour, We Conclude that prosody is not a `preserved'
   cognitive skill in WS. The genetic factors, development in other
   cognitive domains and environmental influences affect developmental
   pathways and as a result, development proceeds along an atypical
   trajectory. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   1467-1477, 2010. First published December 23, 2009; doi:
   10.1152/jn.00637.2009. People are easily able to perceive the human body
   across different viewpoints, but the neural mechanisms underpinning this
   ability are currently unclear. In three experiments, we used functional
   MRI (fMRI) adaptation to study the view-invariance of representations in
   two cortical regions that have previously been shown to be sensitive to
   visual depictions of the human body-the extrastriate and fusiform body
   areas (EBA and FBA). The BOLD response to sequentially presented pairs
   of bodies was treated as an index of view invariance. Specifically, we
   compared trials in which the bodies in each image held identical poses
   (seen from different views) to trials containing different poses. EBA
   and FBA adapted to identical views of the same pose, and both showed a
   progressive rebound from adaptation as a function of the angular
   difference between views, up to similar to 30 degrees. However, these
   adaptation effects were eliminated when the body stimuli were followed
   by a pattern mask. Delaying the mask onset increased the response (but
   not the adaptation effect) in EBA, leaving FBA unaffected. We interpret
   these masking effects as evidence that view-dependent fMRI adaptation is
   driven by later waves of neuronal responses in the regions of interest.
   Finally, in a whole brain analysis, we identified an anterior region of
   the left inferior temporal sulcus (l-aITS) that responded linearly to
   stimulus rotation, but showed no selectivity for bodies. Our results
   show that body-selective cortical areas exhibit a similar degree of
   view-invariance as other object selective areas-such as the lateral
   occipitotemporal area (LO) and posterior fusiform gyrus (pFs).}},

Abstract = {{Perception of emotion in voice is impaired following traumatic brain
   injury (TBI). This Study examined whether an inability to concurrently
   process semantic information (the ``what{''}) and emotional prosody (the
   ``how{''}) of spoken speech contributes to impaired recognition of
   emotional prosody and whether impairment is ameliorated when little or
   no semantic information is provided. Eighteen individuals with mod
   crate-to-severe TBI showing social skills deficits during inpatient
   rehabilitation were compared with 18 demographically matched controls.
   Participants completed two discrimination tasks using spoken sentences
   that varied in the amount of semantic information: that is, (I)
   well-formed English, (2) a nonsense language, and (3) low-pass filtered
   speech producing ``muffled{''} voices. Reducing semantic processing
   demands did not improve perception of emotional prosody. The TBI group
   were significantly less accurate than controls. Impairment was greater
   within the TB I group when accessing semantic memory to label the
   emotion of sentences, compared with simply making ``same/different{''}
   judgments. Findings suggest an impairment of processing emotional
   prosody itself rather than semantic processing demands which leads to an
   over-reliance oil the ``what{''} rather than the ``how,{''} in
   conversational remarks. Emotional recognition accuracy was significantly
   related to the ability to inhibit prepotent responses, consistent with
   neuroanatomical research suggesting similar ventrofrontal systems
   subserve both functions. (JINS, 2010, 16, 369-382.)}},

   this region correlated with individual covariates. It is shown here
   that, provided that data are identically and independently distributed

   effect is unbiased in two cases: when selection is based on a one-sample
   t test of the task effect, or when the subject level covariate is
   centered. This result is meant to contribute to clarifying when using
   the same data for ROI selection and testing leads to valid tests in

Abstract = {{Although a family history of alcoholism is the strongest risk factor for
   developing alcohol dependence, there are few studies of the association
   between familial alcoholism and the human brain's reward system
   activity. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
   determine how family history affects the brain's response to subjects'
   preferred alcoholic drink odors (AID) as compared to appetitive control
   odors (ApCO). Fourteen non-dependent heavy drinkers (HD) who were family
   history positive (FHP) participated, as did 12 HD who were family
   history negative (FHN). Subjects were imaged under both alcohol
   intoxication and placebo, using intravenous infusion and pharmacokinetic
   modeling to target a blood alcohol level of 50 mg\%. Under placebo,
   HD-FHP had a larger medial frontal {[}AO>ApCO] effect than did HD-FHN.
   Alcohol intoxication dampened this response in the HD-FHP but
   potentiated it in the HD-FHN. This suggests that a family history of
   alcoholism and brain exposure to alcohol interact in heavy drinkers to
   differentially affect how the brain responds to alcohol cues. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Deficits in self awareness and taking the perspective of others are

   average interval of 2.6 years and nine typically developing (TD)
   adolescents underwent functional MRI (fMRI) while performing a
   perspective taking task (D'Argembeau et al., 2007). Participants made
   trait attributions either from their own perspective or from that of the
   significant other. The groups did not differ in reaction time or on a
   consistency criterion. When thinking of the self from a third-person
   perspective, adolescents with TBI demonstrated greater activation in
   posterior brain regions implicated in social cognition, the left lingual
   gyrus (BA 18) and posterior cingulate (BA 31), extending into
   neighboring regions not generally associated with social cognition, that
   is, cuneus (BA 31) and parahippocampal gyros, relative to TD

Title = {{Comparing Families of Dynamic Causal Models}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Mathematical models of scientific data can be formally compared using
   Bayesian model evidence. Previous applications in the biological
   sciences have mainly focussed on model selection in which one first
   selects the model with the highest evidence and then makes inferences
   based on the parameters of that model. This ``best model'' approach is
   very useful but can become brittle if there are a large number of models
   to compare, and if different subjects use different models. To overcome
   this shortcoming we propose the combination of two further approaches:
   (i) family level inference and (ii) Bayesian model averaging within
   families. Family level inference removes uncertainty about aspects of
   model structure other than the characteristic of interest. For example:
   What are the inputs to the system? Is processing serial or parallel? Is
   it linear or nonlinear? Is it mediated by a single, crucial connection?
   We apply Bayesian model averaging within families to provide inferences
   about parameters that are independent of further assumptions about model

Abstract = {{A major controversy in the social cognitive neurosciences evolved around
   the question whether activity in the posterior superior temporal sulcus
   and adjacent temporoparietal junction (pSTS/TPJ-region) evoked by
   various tasks represents a common process or distinct processes. To
   investigate this question, we employed functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) while participants performed Biological Motion (BM),
   Theory-of-Mind (ToM) and Moral Judgment (MJ) tasks. Importantly, for
   each task we used the same newly developed animated stimuli. Indicative
   of a common process, we identified small clusters of overlapping
   activity for BM and ToM in right pSTS and for ToM and MJ in bilateral
   pSTS and left TPJ. Indicative of distinct processes, on the contrary, we
   detected extensive dissociable activity for BM in right pSTS, for ToM in
   bilateral pSTS and left TPJ, and for MJ in bilateral pSTS and TPJ. Thus,
   our data provide strong evidence for a combined two-staged process
   account: (i) the parsing of a stream of visual-spatial information,
   represented by activity in right pSTS, where neighboring and overlapping
   clusters of increased responses were found for all three tasks; (ii)
   increasingly more complex processing of the communicative significance
   of other people's behavior, represented by hierarchically increasing
   activity in left pSTS and bilateral TPJ elicited by ToM and MJ.}},

Pages = {{68-76}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies have revealed a consistent overlap between brain
   regions involved in self-processing and those implicated in
   autobiographical memory. However, no study has directly tested how the
   degree of self-involvement with an event being remembered alters the
   neural circuitry engaged during memory retrieval. The present study
   compared hockey players' memories for game elements in which they were
   highly involved (e.g. scoring a goal) versus less involved (e.g.
   watching a goal from the bench). Specifically, we examined how the
   effective connectivity of a network of brain regions known to be
   involved in autobiographical memory retrieval varied based upon the
   players' level of self-involvement with the remembered event. During
   remembering of high self-involvement events, connections between the
   left hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex were `in synchrony' with
   connections between the medial prefrontal cortex and the right
   amygdala-hippocampal complex. By contrast, the hippocampal-prefrontal
   connection was `out-of-sync' with the prefrontal-amygdala connection
   during retrieval of low self-involvement memories. This result is
   discussed in terms of two memory systems (one that is hippocampal-based
   and one that is amygdala-hippocampal-based) that may be involved to
   varying degrees depending upon the characteristics of a remembered
   event.}},

Abstract = {{The field of social neuroscience has made remarkable progress in
   elucidating the neural mechanisms of social cognition. More recently,
   the need for new experimental approaches has been highlighted that allow
   studying social encounters in a truly interactive manner by establishing
   `online' reciprocity in social interaction. In this article, we present
   a newly developed adaptation of a method which uses eyetracking data
   obtained from participants in real time to control visual stimulation
   during functional magnetic resonance imaging, thus, providing an
   innovative tool to generate gaze-contingent stimuli in spite of the
   constraints of this experimental setting. We review results of two
   paradigms employing this technique and demonstrate how gaze data can be
   used to animate a virtual character whose behavior becomes `responsive'
   to being looked at allowing the participant to engage in `online'
   interaction with this virtual other in real-time. Possible applications
   of this setup are discussed highlighting the potential of this
   development as a new `tool of the trade' in social cognitive and
   affective neuroscience.}},

   severity (n = 15). The main regions that were activated by the
   alternation learning task included portions of frontal and orbitofrontal
   cortex as well as the calcarine fissure. Correlations between brain
   activation and performance of the alternation learning task were found,
   among other regions, in the left and right orbitofrontal cortex. Highest
   correlations between degree of activation and the anxiety scores as
   assessed by the Leibovitch Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) were obtained in
   the left temporal region as well as orbitofrontal cortex. This study
   supports the involvement of the orbitofrontal cortex in emotion and

Abstract = {{Empathy deficits might play a role in social dysfunction in
   schizophrenia. However, few studies have investigated the
   neuroanatomical underpinnings of the subcomponents of empathy in
   schizophrenia. This study investigated the hemodynamic responses to
   three subcomponents of empathy in patients with schizophrenia (N=15) and
   healthy volunteers (N=18), performing an empathy cartoon task during
   functional magnetic resonance imaging. The experiment used a block
   design with four conditions: cognitive, emotional, and inhibitory
   empathy, and physical causality control. Data were analyzed by comparing
   the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal activation between the
   two groups. The cognitive empathy condition activated the right temporal
   pole to a lesser extent in the patient group than in comparison
   subjects. in the emotional and inhibitory conditions, the patients
   showed greater activation in the left insula and in the right
   middle/inferior frontal cortex, respectively. These findings add to our
   understanding of the impaired empathy in patients with schizophrenia by
   identifying a multi-level cortical dysfunction that underlies a deficit
   in each subcomponent of empathy and highlighting the importance of the
   fronto-temporal cortical network in ability to empathize. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{This study aimed at determining the functional neuroanatomy of mental
   pain, a hitherto neglected symptom in the study of depression, which
   according to DSM-IV is stronglylinked with suicide. Mental pain
   (measured with the Orbach \& Mikulincer Mental Pain Scale), suicidal
   ideation (measured using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression),
   hopelessness (measured using Beck's Hopelessness Scale), and regional
   cerebral blood flow as measured with single photon emission computed
   tomography were assessed in 39 depressed individuals. Levels of mental
   pain were significantly and positively associated with suicidal ideation
   and levels of hopelessness. When compared with patients with low levels
   of mental pain, those with high levels of mental pain showed relatively
   increased perfusion in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,
   occipital cortex and inferior frontal gyrus and in the left inferior
   temporal gyrus, and relatively decreased perfusion at the medulla. The
   findings indicate that mental pain in depressed patients is associated
   with an increased risk of suicide and that high levels of mental pain
   are associated with changes in perfusion in brain areas that are
   involved in the regulation of emotions. Further study is warranted to
   understand whether this association reflects increased emotional
   processing or decreased cognitive control over mental pain in depressed
   individuals. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Spontaneous low-frequency fluctuations (LFF) in the blood
   oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) signal have been shown to reflect cerebral spontaneous neural
   activity, and the present study attempts to explore the functional
   changes in the regional brain in patients with schizophrenia using the
   amplitude of the BOLD signals.
   Methods: A total of 66 treatment-naive, first-episode schizophrenia
   (FES) patients and 66 normal age- and sex-matched controls were
   recruited. Resting-state fMRIs were obtained using a gradient-echo
   echo-planar imaging sequence. The amplitude of LFF (ALFF) was calculated
   using REST software. Voxel-based analysis of the ALFF maps between
   control and patient groups was performed with twos-sample t-tests using
   SPM2.
   Results: Compared to the controls, the FES group showed significantly
   decreased ALFF in the medial prefrontal lobe (MPFC) and significant
   increases in the ALFF in the left and right putamen. Significant
   positive correlations were observed between ALFF values in the bilateral
   putamen in both the patient and control groups.
   Conclusions: Alterations of the ALFF in the MPFC and putamen in FES
   observed in the present study suggest that the functional abnormalities
   of those areas are at an early stage of the disease. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Currently, most studies that employ dynamic causal modeling (DCM) use
   randorn-effects (RFX) analysis to make group inferences, applying a
   second-level frequentist test to subjects' parameter estimates. In some
   instances, however, fixed-effects (FFX) analysis can be more
   appropriate. Such analyses can be implemented by combining the Subjects'
   posterior densities according to Bayes' theorem either on a multivariate
   (Bayesian parameter averaging or BPA) or univariate basis (posterior
   variance weighted averaging or PVWA), or by applying DCM to time-series
   averaged across subjects beforehand (temporal averaging or TA). While
   all these FFX approaches have the advantage of allowing for Bayesian
   inferences on parameters a systematic comparison of their statistical
   properties has been lacking so far.
   Based on simulated data generated from a two-region network we examined
   the effects of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and population heterogeneity
   on group-level parameter estimates. Data sets were simulated assuming
   either a homogeneous large Population (N = 60) with constant
   connectivities across subjects OF a heterogeneous population with
   varying parameters. TA showed advantages at lower SNR but is limited in
   its applicability. Because BPA and PVWA take into account posterior
   (co)variance structure, they can yield non-intuitive results when only
   considering posterior means. This problem is relevant for high SNR data,
   pronounced parameter interdependencies and when FFX assumptions are
   violated (i.e. inhomogeneous groups). It diminishes with decreasing SNR
   and is absent for models with independent parameters or when FFX
   assumptions are appropriate. Group results obtained with these FFX
   approaches should therefore be interpreted carefully by considering
   estimates of dependencies among model parameters. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Human behaviour is generally guided by the anticipation of potential
   outcomes that are considered to be rewarding. Reward processing can thus
   be dissected into a phase of reward anticipation and a phase of reward
   consumption. A number of brain structures have been suggested to be
   involved in reward processing. However, it is unclear whether
   anticipation and consumption are mediated by the same or different
   neural networks. We examined the neural basis of these processes using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in an incentive delay task
   offering either money or social approval. In both conditions
   participants (N = 28) were given a cue indicating potential reward. In
   order to receive reward a target button had to be pushed within a
   certain time window (adapted for individual reaction time). Cues
   triggering either monetary or social reward anticipation were presented
   sessionwise. Imaging was performed on a 1.5-Tesla Philips scanner in an
   event-related design. Anticipation of both reward types activated brain
   structures constituting the brain reward system including the ventral
   striatum. In contrast to the task independent activity in the
   anticipation phase, reward consumption evoked different patterns of
   activation for money and social approval, respectively. While social
   stimuli were mainly associated with amygdala activation, the thalamus
   was more strongly activated by the presentation of monetary rewards. Our
   results identify dissociable neural networks for the anticipation and
   consumption of reward. The findings implicate that the neural mechanisms
   underlying reward consumption are more modality-specific than those for
   reward anticipation, and that they are mediated by subjective reward
   value. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Two distinct literatures have emerged on the functionality of the
   anterior temporal lobes (ATL): in one field, the ATLs are conceived of
   as a repository for semantic or conceptual knowledge. In another field,
   the ATLs are thought to play some undetermined role in social-emotional
   functions such as Theory of Mind. Here we attempted to reconcile these
   distinct functions by assessing whether social semantic processing can
   explain ATL activation in other social cognitive tasks. Social semantic
   functions refer to knowledge about social concepts and rules. In a first
   experiment we tested the idea that social semantic representations can
   account for activations in the ATL to social attribution stimuli such as
   Heider and Simmel animations. Left ATL activations to Heider and Simmel
   stimuli overlapped with activations to social words. In a second
   experiment we assessed the putative roles of the ATLs in the processing
   of narratives and theory of mind content and found evidence for a role
   of the ATLs in the processing of theory of mind but not narrative per
   se. These findings indicate that the ATLs are part of a neuronal network
   supporting social cognition and that they are engaged when tasks demand
   access to social conceptual knowledge. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The rivalry between the men's basketball teams of Duke University and
   the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill (UNC) is one of the most
   storied traditions in college sports. A subculture of students at each
   university form social bonds with fellow fans, develop expertise in
   college basketball rules, team statistics, and individual players, and
   self-identify as a member of a fan group. The present study capitalized
   on the high personal investment of these fans and the strong affective
   tenor of a Duke-UNC basketball game to examine the neural correlates of
   emotional memory retrieval for a complex sporting event. Male fans
   watched a competitive, archived game in a social setting. During a
   subsequent functional magnetic resonance imaging session, participants
   viewed video clips depicting individual plays of the game that ended
   with the ball being released toward the basket. For each play,
   participants recalled whether or not the shot went into the basket.
   Hemodynamic signal changes time locked to correct memory decisions were
   analyzed as a function of emotional intensity and valence, according to
   the fan's perspective. Results showed intensity-modulated retrieval
   activity in midline cortical structures, sensorimotor cortex, the
   striatum, and the medial temporal lobe, including the amygdala.
   Positively valent memories specifically recruited processing in dorsal
   frontoparietal regions, and additional activity in the insula and medial
   temporal lobe for positively valent shots recalled with high confidence.
   This novel paradigm reveals how brain regions implicated in emotion,
   memory retrieval, visuomotor imagery, and social cognition contribute to
   the recollection of specific plays in the mind of a sports fan.}},

Abstract = {{Reward representation in ventral striatum is boosted by perceptual
   novelty, although the mechanism of this effect remains elusive. Animal
   studies indicate a functional loop (Lisman and Grace, 2005) that
   includes hippocampus, ventral striatum, and midbrain as being important
   in regulating salience attribution within the context of novel stimuli.
   According to this model, reward responses in ventral striatum or
   midbrain should be enhanced in the context of novelty even if reward and
   novelty constitute unrelated, independent events. Using fMRI, we show
   that trials with reward-predictive cues and subsequent outcomes elicit
   higher responses in the striatum if preceded by an unrelated novel
   picture, indicating that reward representation is enhanced in the
   context of novelty. Notably, this effect was observed solely when reward
   occurrence, and hence reward-related salience, was low. These findings
   support a view that contextual novelty enhances neural responses
   underlying reward representation in the striatum and concur with the
   effects of novelty processing as predicted by the model of Lisman and
   Grace (2005).}},

Abstract = {{Background: The physiological and cognitive reactions provoked by
   alcohol cues, as compared to non-alcohol cues, can predict future
   drinking. Alcohol cue reactivity tasks have been developed; however,
   most were created for use with alcohol use disordered individuals and
   utilize limited or only partially standardized stimuli. This project
   systematically created an alcohol cue reactivity task for studies with
   non-drinkers, using well-characterized stimuli.
   Objectives: We comprehensively standardized 60 alcohol and 60
   non-alcohol beverage pictures using ratings from young non-drinkers (N =
   82) on affective and perceptual features.
   Results: A statistical matching approach yielded 26 matched
   alcohol-non-alcohol picture pairs matched on valence, arousal, image
   complexity, brightness, and hue. The task was piloted and further
   refined to 22 picture pairs. An 8-minute. 32-second event-related task
   was created using a random stimulus function for optimized condition
   timing and systematic presentation of the images.
   Conclusions: The long-term objectives of this project are to utilize
   this task with non-drinking youth to investigate how reactivity to
   alcohol stimuli may predict alcohol use initiation and escalation, to
   help identify the role of exposure to alcohol stimuli on the subsequent
   development of alcohol-related problems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Studies of spoken and signed language processing reliably show
   involvement of the posterior superior temporal cortex. This region is
   also reliably activated by observation of meaningless oral and manual
   actions. In this study we directly compared the extent to which
   activation in posterior superior temporal cortex is modulated by
   linguistic knowledge irrespective of differences in language form. We
   used a novel cross-linguistic approach in two groups of volunteers who
   differed in their language experience. Using fMRI, we compared deaf
   native signers of British Sign Language (BSL), who were also proficient
   speech-readers of English (i.e., two languages) with hearing people who
   could speechread English, but knew no BSL (i.e., one language). Both
   groups were presented with BSL signs and silently spoken English words,
   and were required to respond to a signed or spoken target. The
   interaction of group and condition revealed activation in the superior
   temporal cortex, bilaterally, focused in the posterior superior temporal
   gyri (pSTC, BA 42/22). In hearing people, these regions were activated
   more by speech than by sign, but in deaf respondents they showed similar
   levels of activation for both language forms - suggesting that posterior
   superior temporal regions are highly sensitive to language knowledge
   irrespective of the mode of delivery of the stimulus material. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{The cerebellum has traditionally been viewed as a brain structure
   subserving skilled motor behaviors. However, the cerebellum might be

   observation and understanding of others' actions. Veridical visual
   perception of human body motion is of immense importance for a variety
   of daily-life situations and for successful social interactions. Here,
   by combining visual psychophysics with a lesion analysis, we assessed
   visual sensitivity to human walking in patients with lesions to the left
   cerebellum. Patients with left lateral cerebellar lesions exhibit
   deficits in visual sensitivity to body motion, whereas medial lesions do
   not substantially affect visual perception of human locomotion. The
   findings point to left lateral cerebellar involvement in an action
   observation network. We discuss possible mechanisms of cerebellar
   engagement in visual social perception revealed by body motion.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive processing processing among schizophrenia participants,
   entailing encoding of presenting stimulation into a format facilitating
   collateral processes (e.g., memory search), is examined in light of
   stochastic mathematical models of performance. Results implicate
   additional encoding operations (encoding subprocesses) as the source of
   schizophrenia encoding-process elongation. Convergent evidence for this
   inference, including that from auxiliary neuro-connectionist
   simulations, are brought forth. Developments from initial,
   fixed-parameter accounts include random-parameter mixtures, and their
   Bayesian extensions, formally mediating group-level results to
   assessment of individual performance. Outgrowths bear on model-selection
   methodology, according to coherence of group-level and individual-level
   model functioning (in part addressing the issue of ``small-trial-sample
   model testing{''}); longitudinal monitoring of encoding-specific
   treatment response; evaluation of treatment-regimen efficacy with
   respect to encoding efficiency; and specification of times of
   measurement interest, in fMRI. The symptom significance of encoding
   elongation, strongly hinted at by model developments, along with a
   model-endowed window on exacerbating effects of stress, are drawn out.

Abstract = {{Contralateral sensory deficits in Wallenberg's lateral medullary
   syndrome suggest bilateral processing of trigeminal afferent input in
   the human brainstem. On the basis of experiments in rodents and clinical
   data, the present study addresses the hypothesis of bilateral projection
   of facial nociceptive input onto the spinal trigeminal nucleus (STN) in
   healthy humans. Nociceptive processing in the brainstem was investigated
   by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 18 healthy
   volunteers. Heat stimuli (39, 43, 46A degrees C) were applied by a
   Peltier type thermode to the left forehead (V1) and the left mental
   region (V3). Analyses of fMRI data were performed with SPM2 and
   BrainVoyager software. A region-of-interest approach analyzed local
   activation in the STN. Heat evoked significant bilateral activation in
   the STN (P < 0.01, T > 2.8). Contralateral activation was more frequent
   during stimulation of the V1 than of the V3 region. Whereas activation
   by V1 stimulation was located in caudal STN, V3 stimulation induced
   activity in more rostral parts of the STN. Functional MRI data in humans
   suggest bilateral brainstem activation when heat is applied to the face.
   Contralateral brainstem activity is more pronounced by stimulation of V1
   as compared to V3. The results indicate similar nociceptive processing
   in humans and rodents and may explain clinical findings.}},

Abstract = {{Extant neural models of self-evaluation are dominated by associations
   with medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex
   (PCC) function and have mostly been developed from studies
   differentiating self-evaluation from evaluation of other people.
   Although self-evaluation is robustly characterized by systematic biases.
   current neural models of self-evaluation cannot speak to their
   neurobiology because of a lack of research. The few extant studies have
   made claims about associations between bias and ventral anterior
   cingulate cortex (vACC) function but have confounded bias with the
   valence of experimental stimuli. In study 1, fMRI was used to examine
   the neurobiology of the ``above-average{''} effect. a robust
   self-evaluation bias The majority of people judge their personality to
   be more desirable (i e. more positive and less negative traits) than
   their peers' personalities MPFC and PCC were significantly more
   activated by a condition that reduced susceptibility to
   ``above-average{''} judgments However, MPFC and PFCC activity were not
   modulated by individual differences in ``above-average{''} judgments
   VACC activity distinguished positive from negative valence but did not
   predict individual differences in ``above-average{''} judgments Instead,
   the extent to which participants viewed themselves as ``above
   average{''} was negatively correlated with orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)
   and, to a lesser extent, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)
   activation A complementary study found that mental load increases
   ``above-average{''} judgments (study 2) These findings are the first to
   directly examine the neural systems involved in social judgment bias and
   have implications for the association between frontal lobe dysfunction
   and poor insight. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{A recent study in monkeys showed that averted gaze displayed by

   angry, happy, and neutral faces with either direct or averted gaze
   Averted versus direct gaze induced increased amygdala responses

   results suggest that a principal mechanism whereby popularity ratings
   affect consumer choice is through the anxiety generated by the mismatch
   between one's own preferences and others' This mismatch anxiety
   motivates people to switch their choices in the direction of the
   consensus. Our data Suggest that this is a major force behind the

Abstract = {{A strong link exists between cigarette smoking and alcohol use, which
   may be explained by the experimental observation that alcohol ingestion
   promotes cigarette craving and precipitates smoking. At the
   neuroanatomic level, it is unclear where and how alcohol exerts these
   effects, although the process likely involves the ventral striatum given
   its function in motivational salience and appetitive reinforcement. In a
   double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover study, heavy drinking
   nondaily social smokers (ie, light smokers or `chippers') were examined
   using functional magnetic resonance imaging after they ingested an acute
   dose of alcohol or placebo. We probed reactivity in the ventral striatum
   and other brain regions during exposure to visual smoking vs nonsmoking
   control cues. We found that alcohol enhanced self-reported ratings of
   desire to smoke, and in this context, significantly increased ventral
   striatum responses to smoking compared with control cues. In exploratory
   analyses, we observed that alcohol dampened orbitofrontal activity
   across both cue types, whereas dorsolateral prefrontal and anterior
   cingulate cortex activation to smoking cues was not affected by alcohol.
   This study bridges a pharmacological challenge approach to the study of
   brain reactivity to smoking cues, extends prior cigarette cue imaging
   studies to nondependent smokers, and elucidates a potential
   neurobiological mechanism to explain the co-consumption of alcohol and
   cigarettes in nondependent users. Neuropsychopharmacology (2010) 35,

Abstract = {{Objectives: Language processing abnormalities are a hallmark feature of
   schizophrenia. Yet, no study to date has investigated underlying neural
   networks associated with discourse processing in adolescents at clinical
   high risk (CHR) for developing psychosis(1).
   Methods: Forty CHR youth and 24 demographically comparable healthy
   controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while
   performing a naturalistic discourse processing paradigm. We assessed
   differences in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activity between
   task conditions (Topic Maintenance vs. Reasoning) and between groups.
   Furthermore, we examined the association of regional brain activity with
   symptom severity and social outcome at follow-up, 6 to 24 months after
   the scan.
   Results: Relative to controls, CHR participants showed increased neural
   activity in a network of language-associated brain regions, including
   the medial prefrontal cortex bilaterally, left inferior frontal (LIFG;
   BA44/45, 47) and middle temporal gyri, and the anterior cingulate (BA24
   and 32). Further, increased activity in the superior temporal gyrus
   (STG), caudate, and LIFG distinguished those who subsequently developed
   psychosis. Within the CHR sample, severity of positive formal thought
   disorder at follow-up was positively correlated with signal change in
   the LIFG. Superior frontal gyrus, and inferior/middle temporal gyri,
   whereas social outcome was inversely correlated with signal change in
   the LIFG and anterior cingulate.
   Conclusions: These findings are consistent with a neural inefficiency
   hypothesis in those at greatest risk for psychosis, and additionally
   suggest that baseline activation differences may predict symptomatic and
   functional outcome. These results highlight the need to further
   investigate the neural systems involved in conversion to psychosis, and
   how language disruption changes over time in at-risk adolescents. (C)

Abstract = {{Background: Impaired awareness of the self and others (i.e.,
   metacognitive evaluations) are seen in schizophrenia. We compared
   patterns of activation in schizophrenia (SZ) and nonclinical subjects
   during a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task of
   metacognitive evaluations that has been demonstrated to engage the
   neural circuitry of the self in healthy subjects.
   Methods: Eleven SZ subjects (7 males, mean age 26.6 +/- 8) and 10
   healthy control subjects (4 males, mean age 29.6 +/- 8.4) were enrolled.
   Participants completed two runs of a metacognitive evaluation task (self
   vs. other vs. word meaning). fMRI data was obtained using a full body
   Bruker MedSped 4.0 Tesla system. Group contrasts were performed using an
   uncorrected p<0.005 with a 50 voxel extent threshold.
   Results: We observed a significant hypoactivation in the left superior
   temporal sulcus (STS) during metacognitive evaluations of others (OE)
   vs. semantic positivity evaluations (SPE) and a trend toward significant
   hypoactivation in the OE vs. self evaluations (SE) in the SZ group.
   Significant hypoactivation was also seen in the right inferior temporal
   gyrus (ITG) in the OE vs. SE contrasts in the SZ group. A trendworthy
   hypoactivation was seen in the SZ group in the right middle frontal
   gyrus and pole of the left STS during OE vs. SPE and SE contrasts
   respectively.
   Conclusions: These results extend previous findings of impaired
   metacognitive evaluative processes in schizophrenia to aberrations of
   the neural circuitry implicated in self/other awareness among SZ
   patients. Greater understanding of the neural basis of deficits of
   self/other awareness in early schizophrenia may contribute to
   improvements in the identification and treatment of individuals at risk
   for the illness. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Motor priming refers to the direct matching of an observed action onto
   the observer's motor repertoire (lacoboni et al., 1999) leading to a
   tendency to automatically reproduce the action. Recent research has
   shown diminished automatic imitation when observing nonbiological
   agents, biomechanically impossible actions, and non-intentionally
   produced actions. However, the question of whether automatic imitation
   also occurs for physically impossible actions remains open We found
   motor priming effects of the same size for both physically possible and
   impossible movements in a choice-reaction task paradigm (Experiment 1).
   Both physically possible and impossible movements also elicited
   identical motor priming effects when attention was drawn to the
   difference between possible and impossible movements (Experiment 2).
   While previous research clearly showed a sensitivity of the automatic
   imitation system to biological plausibility and attributed
   intentionality, the present findings show its insensitivity to physical
   plausibility, a finding that remains unaffected by top-down influences.}},

Abstract = {{The present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study sought to
   characterize neural processes related to aspects of empathy and social
   cognition It has been hypothesized previously that merely observing
   emotions in others automatically activates associated representations of
   the emotional state in the observer We tested this prediction by
   presenting drawings depicting either one or two persons in an
   emotionally charged or neutral situation Importantly and in contrast to
   previous imaging studies on empathy or social cognition, we did not
   instruct participants to assess the depicted persons' feelings or
   thoughts, but told them to simply watch the pictures to be able to
   perform a memory task unrelated to the main experimental question This
   novel design allowed us to assess automatically elicited empathy-related
   effects (contrasting emotional and neutral situations) and to compare
   them with automatic social cognitive processes (contrasting stimuli with
   two persons vs one person). We observed empathy-related increased
   hemodynamic responses in areas previously shown to be related to emotion
   processing (ventromedial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, PFC) and
   to social cognitive processes (superior temporal sulcus, STS, and medial
   PFC) The medial PFC activation was negatively correlated with
   participants' predisposition to feel distressed in emotional social
   situations, suggesting that interindividual differences in these
   higher-order functions might also impact empathic responses in social
   interactions (C) 2009 Elsevier B V All rights reserved}},

Title = {{Common Premotor Regions for the Perception and Production of Prosody and
   Correlations with Empathy and Prosodic Ability}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Prosody, the melody and intonation of speech, involves the
   rhythm, rate, pitch and voice quality to relay linguistic and emotional
   information from one individual to another. A significant component of
   human social communication depends upon interpreting and responding to
   another person's prosodic tone as well as one's own ability to produce
   prosodic speech. However there has been little work on whether the
   perception and production of prosody share common neural processes, and
   if so, how these might correlate with individual differences in social
   ability.
   Methods: The aim of the present study was to determine the degree to
   which perception and production of prosody rely on shared neural
   systems. Using fMRI, neural activity during perception and production of
   a meaningless phrase in different prosodic intonations was measured.
   Regions of overlap for production and perception of prosody were found
   in premotor regions, in particular the left inferior frontal gyrus
   (IFG). Activity in these regions was further found to correlate with how
   high an individual scored on two different measures of affective empathy
   as well as a measure on prosodic production ability.
   Conclusions: These data indicate, for the first time, that areas that
   are important for prosody production may also be utilized for prosody
   perception, as well as other aspects of social communication and social
   understanding, such as aspects of empathy and prosodic ability.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral studies show that people self-enhance across a number of
   domains, including self-face recognition. We used functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate whether response to physical
   similarity to the self would differ depending on whether the self-face
   was morphed with a positive (trustworthy) or negative (untrustworthy)
   novel face. Participants were presented with morphs of their faces
   (20\%, 40\%, 50\%, 60\%, and 80\% self) and asked to decide whether the
   morph looked like them or the other face. Participants were more likely
   to identify the trustworthy than the untrustworthy morphs as looking
   like the self. Moreover, there were large differences in brain
   activation to trustworthy and untrustworthy morphs. As similarity of the
   untrustworthy morphs to the self decreased, the response in a number of
   regions, including bilateral posterior superior temporal sulcus/inferior
   parietal lobule, right inferior frontal gyrus, and bilateral
   middle/inferior temporal gyrus, increased. In contrast, there was little
   evidence for changes in activation as a function of the similarity to
   trustworthy faces. That is, these regions seemed to differentiate
   between the self and untrustworthy faces to a much greater extent than
   between the self and trustworthy faces, despite the fact that the task
   did not demand evaluation of the faces. The findings suggest that
   comparing the self to others who are viewed as positive versus negative
   triggers different psychological processes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Although many studies have found similar cortical areas activated during
   the recognition of objects encoded through vision or touch, little is
   known about cortical areas involved in the crossmodal recognition of
   dynamic objects. Here, we investigated which cortical areas are involved
   in the recognition of moving objects and were specifically interested in
   whether motion areas are involved in the recognition of dynamic objects
   within and across sensory modalities. Prior to scanning, participants
   first learned to recognise a set of 12 novel objects, each presented
   either visually or haptically, and either moving or stationary. We then
   conducted fMRI whilst participants performed an old-new task with static
   images of learned or not-learned objects. We found the fusiform and
   right inferior frontal gyri more activated to within-modal Visual than
   crossmodal object recognition. Our results also revealed increased
   activation in area hMT+, LOC and the middle occipital gyrus, in the
   right hemisphere only, for the objects learned as moving compared to the
   learned static objects, regardless of modality. We propose that the
   network of cortical areas involved in the recognition of dynamic objects
   is largely independent of modality and have important implications for
   understanding the neural substrates of multisensory dynamic object
   recognition. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We casually observe many interactions that do not really concern us. Yet
   sometimes we need to be able to rapidly appraise whether an interaction
   between two people represents a real threat for one of them Father than
   an innocent tease. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we
   investigated whether small differences in the body language of two
   interacting people are picked up by the brain even if observers are
   performing an unrelated task. Fourteen participants were scanned while
   watching 3-s movies (192 trials and 96 scrambles) showing a male person
   either threatening or teasing a female one. In one task condition,
   observers categorized the interaction as threatening or teasing, and in
   the other, they monitored randomly appearing dots and categorized the
   color. Our results clearly show that right amygdala responds more to
   threatening than to teasing situations irrespective of the observers'
   task. When observers' attention is not explicitly directed to the
   situation, this heightened amygdala activation goes together with
   increased activity in body sensitive regions in fusiform gyrus,
   extrastriate body area-human motion complex and superior temporal sulcus
   and is associated with a better behavioral performance of the
   participants during threatening situations. In addition, regions
   involved in action observation (inferior frontal gyrus, temporoparietal
   junction, and inferior parietal lobe) and preparation (premotor,
   putamen) show increased activation for threat videos. Also regions
   involved in processing moral violations (temporoparietal junction,
   hypothalamus) reacted selectively to the threatening interactions. Taken
   together, our results show which brain regions react selectively to
   witnessing a threatening interaction even if the situation is not
   attended because the observers perform an unrelated task. (C) 2009

Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{1308}},

Month = {{JAN 13}},
Abstract = {{Empathy is an important component of human relationships, yet the neural
   mechanisms that facilitate empathy are unclear. The broad construct of
   empathy incorporates both cognitive and affective components. Cognitive
   empathy includes mentalizing skills such as perspective-taking.
   Affective empathy consists of the affect produced in response to someone
   else's emotional state, a process which is facilitated by simulation or
   ``mirroring.{''} Prior evidence shows that mentalizing tasks engage a
   neural network which includes the temporoparietal junction, superior
   temporal sulcus, and medial prefrontal cortex. On the other hand,
   simulation tasks engage the fronto-parietal mirror neuron system (MNS)
   which includes the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the somotosensory
   related cortex (SRC). Here, we tested whether neural activity in these
   two neural networks was related to self-reports of cognitive and
   affective empathy in daily life. Participants viewed social scenes in
   which the shift of direction of attention of a character did or did not
   change the character's mental and emotional state. As expected, the task
   robustly activated both mentalizing and MNS networks. We found that when
   detecting the character's change in mental and emotional state, neural
   activity in both networks is strongly related to cognitive empathy.
   Specifically, neural activity in the IFG, SRC, and STS were related to
   cognitive empathy. Activity in the precentral gyrus was related to
   affective empathy. The findings suggest that both simulation and
   mentalizing networks contribute to multiple components of empathy. (C)

Title = {{Neural substrates of irony comprehension: A functional MRI study}},
Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{1308}},
Pages = {{114-123}},
Month = {{JAN 13}},
Abstract = {{In daily communication, we sometimes use ironic expressions to convey
   the opposite meaning. To understand these contradictory statements, we
   have to infer contextual implications and the speaker's mental state.
   However, little is known about how our brains carry out these complex
   processes. in this study, we investigated the neural substrates involved
   in irony comprehension using echoic utterance (Sperber and Wilson, 1986,
   1995). Participants read a short scenario that consisted of five
   sentences. The first four sentences explained the situation of the
   protagonists. The fifth connoted either an ironic, literal, or
   unconnected meaning. The participants had to press a button to indicate
   whether or not the final sentence expressed irony. In the ironic
   sentence condition, the bilateral superior frontal gyrus, middle frontal
   gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, medial prefrontal cortex, superior
   temporal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, caudate, thalamus, the left
   insula, and amygdala were activated. In the literal sentence condition,
   the right superior frontal gyrus, the bilateral middle frontal gyrus,
   inferior frontal gyrus, medial prefrontal cortex, superior temporal
   gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, caudate, the left insula, the right
   thalamus, and the left amygdala were activated. However, in the ironic
   sentence condition minus the literal sentence condition, we observed
   higher activation in the right medial prefrontal cortex (BA 10), the
   right precentral (BA 6), and the left superior temporal sulcus (BA 21).
   Our results suggest that irony comprehension is strongly related to
   mentalizing processes and that activation in these regions might be
   affected by higher-order cognitive operations. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Little is known about the neural networks supporting value computation
   during complex social decisions. We investigated this question using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging while subjects made donations to
   different charities. We found that the blood oxygenation level-dependent
   signal in ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) correlated with the
   subjective value of voluntary donations. Furthermore, the region of the
   VMPFC identified showed considerable overlap with regions that have been
   shown to encode for the value of basic rewards at the time of choice,
   suggesting that it might serve as a common valuation system during
   decision making. In addition, functional connectivity analyses indicated
   that the value signal in VMPFC might integrate inputs from networks,
   including the anterior insula and posterior superior temporal cortex,
   that are thought to be involved in social cognition.}},

Abstract = {{First-degree relatives of persons with bipolar disorders (BDs) carry
   elevated risk for the illness, and manifest deficits in attention and
   memory (possible ``endophenotypes{''}). However, there is only one
   published functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of
   candidate endophenotypes in BD. We used fMRI to examine brain function
   in BD and in first-degree relatives performing a 2-back working memory
   (WM) task, and correlated brain activity with mood measures taken at the
   scanning session. Subjects (age 32-46) were 19 persons with BD, 18
   unmedicated, non-psychotic first-degree relatives (RELs) of persons with
   BD, and 19 matched controls, ascertained from a long-term follow-up of a
   prenatal cohort study in New England. fMRI signal during 2-back and
   0-back WM tasks was measured on a Siemens 1.5T MR scanner. fMRI data
   were analyzed using SPM-2. Persons with BD and RELs failed to suppress
   activation in the left anterior insula (BA 13) during WM, whereas
   controls suppressed activation. Compared to controls, RELs also failed
   to suppress activation in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and superior
   parietal cortex. Controls and RELs exhibited greater activation than BD
   individuals in the left frontopolar cortex (BA 10) during WM. Results
   remained significant after controlling for confounders except for mild
   attenuation of OFC findings. Significant correlations between brain
   activity, mood, and WM suggest that activity in WM circuits is affected
   by activity in emotion-regulatory circuits. Persons with BD and RELs
   exhibit altered activity in the frontopolar cortex and insula, which may
   represent biomarkers of genetic risk for BD. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Individuals with autism spectrum disorders often
   exhibit atypical language patterns, including delay of speech onset,
   literal speech interpretation, and poor recognition of social and
   emotional cues in speech. We acquired functional MR images during an
   auditory language task to evaluate systematic differences in
   language-network activation between control and high-functioning
   autistic populations.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one right-handed male subjects (26
   high-functioning autistic subjects, 15 controls) were studied by using
   an auditory phrase-recognition task, and areas of differential
   activation between groups were identified. Hand preference, verbal
   intelligence quotient (10), age, and language-function testing were
   included as covariables in the analysis.
   RESULTS: Control and autistic subjects showed similar
   language-activation networks, with 2 notable differences. Control
   subjects showed significantly increased activation in the left posterior
   insula compared with autistic subjects (P < .05, false discovery rate),
   and autistic subjects showed increased bilaterality of receptive
   language compared with control subjects. Higher receptive-language
   scores on standardized testing were associated with greater activation
   of the posterior aspect of the left Wernicke area. A higher verbal 10
   was associated with greater activation of the bilateral Broca area and
   involvement of the prefrontal cortex and lateral premotor cortex.
   CONCLUSIONS: Control subjects showed greater activation of the posterior
   insula during receptive language, which may correlate with impaired
   emotive processing of language in autism. Subjects with autism showed
   greater bilateral activation of receptive-language areas, which was out
   of proportion to the differerces in hand preference in autism and
   control populations.}},

Abstract = {{This review examines how advances in neuroscience are affecting civil
   law, criminal law, and law enforcement. Brain imaging techniques have
   already been used to detect brain injury, assess pain, and determine
   mental state and capacity for rational thought. There is also much
   excitement about using neuroimaging to detect lies and deception in
   legal and national security contexts. Despite claims of neuroimaging's
   revolutionary nature, numerous questions should be answered about their
   validity and reliability before they become widely adopted.
   Neuroscientists still do not fully understand the link between brain
   activity and behavior or memory formation. Important legal and ethical
   questions remain unresolved, particularly around the potential effect on
   juries and judges of colorful, but scientifically unproven, brain
   images. Finally, the very impetus behind the use of neuroscience in the
   legal system-to avoid the subjectivity and uncertainty of more
   traditional methods for assessing thought and behavior-may be misguided.}},

Abstract = {{This research investigated the contribution of the dorsolateral

   transcranial magnetic stimulations (TMS) were used to interfere
   transiently with either the left or right DLPFC during encoding under
   full attention (FA) or under divided attention (DA) in a recognition
   paradigm using words and random shapes. Participants recognized fewer
   items after TMS over the left DLPFC than over the right DLPFC during FA
   encoding. However, TMS over the left DLPFC did not impair performance
   when compared to sham condition. Conversely, participants produced fewer
   items after TMS over the right DLPFC in DA encoding compared to sham
   condition, but not compared to TMS over the left DLPFC. These effects
   were found for both words and random shapes. These results suggest that
   the right DLPFC play an important role in successful encoding with a
   concomitant task regardless of the type of material.}},

   a special case of biological traits, they maintain that psychological
   categories should be individuated primarily by relations of homology
   rather than in terms of shared function. This poses a direct challenge
   to the dominant philosophical view of how to define psychological
   categories, viz., `functionalism'. Although the implications of this
   position extend to all psychological traits, the debate has centered
   around `emotion' as an example of a psychological category ripe for
   reinterpretation within this new framework of classification. I address
   arguments by Griffiths that emotions should be divided into at least two
   distinct classes, basic emotions and higher cognitive emotions, and that
   these two classes require radically different theories to explain them.
   Griffiths argues that while basic emotions in humans are homologous to
   the corresponding states in other animals, higher cognitive emotions are
   dependent on mental capacities unique to humans, and are therefore not
   homologous to basic emotions. Using the example of shame, I argue that
   (a) many emotions that are commonly classified as being higher cognitive
   emotions actually correspond to certain basic emotions, and that (b) the
   ``higher cognitive forms{''} of these emotions are best seen as being
   homologous to their basic forms.}},

Title = {{Integration of gaze direction and facial expression in patients with
   unilateral amygdala damage}},
Journal = {{BRAIN}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{133}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{248-261}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Affective and social processes play a major role in everyday life, but
   appropriate methods to assess disturbances in these processes after
   brain lesions are still lacking. Past studies have shown that amygdala
   damage can impair recognition of facial expressions, particularly fear,
   as well as processing of gaze direction; but the mechanisms responsible
   for these deficits remain debated. Recent accounts of human amygdala
   function suggest that it is a critical structure involved in
   self-relevance appraisal. According to such accounts, responses to a
   given facial expression may vary depending on concomitant gaze direction
   and perceived social meaning. Here we investigated facial emotion
   recognition and its interaction with gaze in patients with unilateral
   amygdala damage (n = 19), compared to healthy controls (n = 10), using
   computer-generated dynamic face stimuli expressing variable intensities
   of fear, anger or joy, with different gaze directions (direct versus
   averted). If emotion perception is influenced by the self-relevance of
   expression based on gaze direction, a fearful face with averted gaze
   should be more relevant than the same expression with direct gaze
   because it signals danger near the observer; whereas anger with direct
   gaze should be more relevant than with averted gaze because it directly
   threatens the observer. Our results confirm a critical role for the
   amygdala in self-relevance appraisal, showing an interaction between
   gaze and emotion in healthy controls, a trend for such interaction in
   left-damaged patients but not in right-damaged patients. Impaired
   expression recognition was generally more severe for fear, but with a
   greater deficit for right versus left damage. These findings do not only
   provide new insights on human amygdala function, but may also help
   design novel neuropsychological tests sensitive to amygdala dysfunction
   in various patient populations.}},

Journal = {{BRAIN INJURY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{89-99}},
Abstract = {{Primary objective: The Word Memory Test (WMT) is a popular symptom
   validity test in which individuals are required to remember and recall
   semantically-related word pairs. Research shows successful WMT
   completion employs a wide neural network which is involved in tasks
   requiring high cognitive effort. The primary purpose of this study was
   to replicate earlier fMRI findings using a larger sample and extend
   previous findings by including male and female subjects. The second
   purpose was to investigate the neural networks involved during
   intentional malingering on the WMT.
   Research design: For all trials, a time-series ANCOVA design was
   implemented using SPM5 software.
   Methods and procedures: Ten subjects (five male and five female)
   underwent fMRI imaging while completing the WMT in full-effort and
   simulated poor effort conditions.
   Main outcome and results: Full-effort trials found activation peaks in
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, superior parietal lobe, anterior
   cingulate, bilateral lingual cortices and anterior insula/frontal
   operculum, supporting earlier findings. Simulated poor effort trials had
   similar foci of activation, with additional peak strength in surrounding
   cortical regions identified previously as relevant to simulated
   malingering. No sex differences were observed in either condition.
   Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the neural underpinnings of WMT
   performance in normal and simulated performance.}},

Abstract = {{There has been evidence for functional abnormalities of the verbal
   working memory system in schizophrenia. Verbal working memory crucially
   involves the interplay between the anterior and posterior language
   systems, and previous studies have shown converging evidence for
   abnormalities in the posterior language system in schizophrenia. In this
   functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we measured cortical
   activity in chronic schizophrenic patients and matched healthy controls
   during auditory and visual verbal working memory tasks. We employed 1)
   regional analyses specifically targeting the posterior language system
   and 2) analyses of functional connectivity between anterior and
   posterior language regions. We performed these analyses separately for
   each memory stage and modality. In the regional analyses, the left
   sylvian-parietal-temporal (Spt) area consistently showed reduced
   activation during encoding and retrieval stages in schizophrenia.
   Magnitudes of activation in the left posterior superior temporal sulcus
   were correlated with the severity of delusions at every memory stage.
   Functional connectivity analyses revealed reduced connectivity between
   the left Spt and the anterior insula during the encoding of auditory
   words. In addition, the connectivity strength was correlated with the
   severity of auditory hallucinations. These findings identify abnormal
   components in the verbal working memory system and illustrate their
   possible overlap with the mechanisms of core schizophrenic symptoms.}},

Journal = {{COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Patients with visual extinction following right-hemisphere damage can
   typically detect left visual field stimulation when it is presented in
   isolation, but tend to miss this when it is paired with competing
   concurrent right visual stimulation. Some single-case studies have
   provided preliminary evidence that right visual cortex may show residual
   activation for contralesional, extinguished visual stimuli. Here we go
   beyond prior work by using individual retinotopic mapping and online
   eye-tracking during fMRI to study activity in stimulus-responsive
   retinotopic visual cortex for a case series of four extinction patients.
   We found consistent activation of retinotopic right visual cortex for
   bilateral visual stimulation that resulted in left extinction. This
   residual unconscious activation included areas V1 to V3 and was not due
   to inadvertent eye movements. We also provide further evidence for the
   emerging view that awareness may require activity of frontal and
   parietal regions well beyond visual cortex.}},

Abstract = {{This study discusses the computational analysis of general emotion
   understanding from questionnaires methodology. The questionnaires method
   approaches the subject by investigating the real experience that

   generally associated with exaggerated elements. We adopted a

   map (SVESOM) to analyse the emotion profiling from the questionnaires
   method. The SVESOM first identifies the important variables by giving
   discriminative features with high ranking. The classifier then performs
   the classification based on the selected features. Experimental results
   show that the top rank features are in line with the work of Scherer and
   Wallbott {[}(1994), `Evidence for Universality and Cultural Variation of
   Differential Emotion Response Patterning', Journal of Personality and
   Social Psychology, 66, 310-328], which approached the emotions
   physiologically. While the performance measures show that using the full
   features for classifications can degrade the performance, the selected
   features provide superior results in terms of accuracy and

Abstract = {{This paper provides an overview of imaging studies in samples of men

   the notion that aggressive behaviour can be conceptualised in terms of
   at least two types, reactive and pro-active, and that few studies
   separate them. The neuro-anatomical basis of aggression and associated
   neurobehavioural theories are discussed in relation to clinical
   disorders (mainly anti-social personality pathology) associated with
   these different types of aggressive behaviour. Structural (computed
   tomography, magnetic resonance imaging) and functional (positron

Abstract = {{Objectives The nines were to determine if emotion recognition deficits
   observed in eating disorders generalise to non-clinical disordered
   eating anti to establish if other psychopathological and personality
   factors contributed to, or accounted for, these deficits
   Design Females with high (n=23) and low (n=22) scores on the Eating
   Disorder Inventory (EDI) were assessed oil their ability to recognise
   emotion from videotaped social interactions Participants also completed
   a face memory task, a Stroop task, and self-report treasures of
   alexithymia, depression and anxiety
   Results Relative to the low EDI group. high EDI participants exhibited a
   general deficit in recognition of emotion. which was related to their
   scores on the alexithymia measure and the bulimia subscale of the EDI
   They also exhibited a specific deficit in the recognition of angel.
   which was related to their scores oil the body dissatisfaction subscale
   of the EDI
   Conclusions. In line with clinical eating disorders, non-clinical
   disordered eating is associated with emotion recognition deficits.
   However, the nature of these deficits appears to be dependent upon the
   type of eating psychopathology and the degree of co-morbid alexithymia

Abstract = {{Using an fMRI-based classification approach and the structural equation
   modeling (SEM) method, this study examined the neural bases of atypical
   planning and execution processes involved in stuttering. Twelve
   stuttering speakers and 12 controls were asked to name pictures under
   different conditions (single-syllable. multi-syllable, or
   repeated-syllable) in the scanner. The contrasts between conditions
   provided information about planning and execution processes. The
   classification analysis showed that, as compared to non-stuttering
   controls, stuttering speakers' atypical planning of speech was evident
   in their neural activities in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)
   and right putamen and their atypical execution of speech was evident in
   their activations in the right cerebellum and insula, left premotor area
   (PMA), and angular gyrus (AG). SEM results further revealed two parallel
   neural circuits-the basal ganglia-IFG/PMA circuit and the cerebellum-PMA
   circuit-that were involved in atypical planning and execution processes
   of stuttering, respectively. The AG appeared to be involved in the
   interface of atypical planning and execution in stuttering. These
   results are discussed in terms of their implications to the theories
   about Stuttering and to clinical applications. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{We often form impressions of others based on superficial information,
   such as a mere glimpse of their face. Given the opportunity to get to
   know someone, however, our judgments are allowed to become more
   individuated. The neural origins of these two types of social judgment
   remain unknown. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to
   dissociate the neural mechanisms underlying superficial and individuated
   judgments. Given behavioral evidence demonstrating impairments in
   individuating others outside one's racial group, we additionally
   examined whether these neural mechanisms are race-selective. Superficial
   judgments recruited the amygdala. Individuated judgments engaged a
   cortical network implicated in mentalizing and theory of mind. One
   component of this mentalizing network showed selectivity to individuated
   judgments, but exclusively for targets of one's own race. The findings
   reveal the distinct-and race-selective-neural bases of our everyday
   superficial and individuated judgments of others. Hum Brain Mapp

Abstract = {{Objectives We investigate possible differences in neural correlates of
   empathy processing between abstinent methamphetamine (MA) abusers and
   healthy subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   Methods Nineteen abstinent MA abusers (mean age of 36.06 years, range
   31-52 years) and 19 healthy subjects (mean age of 37.05 years, range
   33-42 years) participated in this study. A visual fMRI activation
   paradigm was used, comprising a series of cartoons, each depicting a
   short story. There were two categories of stories: empathy (Empathy) and
   Physical causality (Physical). fMRI images were acquired using a 3.0 T
   whole-body scanner. All fMRI data were analyzed using MATLAB v. 7.2 and
   SPM5.
   Results Both MA subjects and controls exhibited activation in the
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Despite this similarity in activation
   patterns, we found that the two groups differed in the activation of
   several cortical regions associated with the processing of empathy
   information. Hypoactivations of the orbitofrontal cortex, temporal
   poles, and hippocampus in MA abusers relative to healthy subjects
   suggests that the ability of empathic response could be compromised in
   abstinent MA abusers (p < 0.05, corrected for a small volume).
   Conclusions Functional impairments in the empathic neural network caused
   by MA may contribute to the misunderstanding of others and to the
   erosion of social interactions in MA abusers. Copyright (C) 2009 John

Abstract = {{The ability to infer others' thoughts, intentions, and feelings is
   regarded as uniquely human. Over the last few decades, this remarkable
   ability has captivated the attention of philosophers, primatologists,
   clinical and developmental psychologists, anthropologists, social
   psychologists, and cognitive neuroscientists. Most would agree that the
   capacity to reason about others' mental states is innately prepared,
   essential for successful human social interaction. Whether this ability
   is culturally tuned, however, remains entirely uncharted on both the
   behavioral and neural levels. Here we provide the first behavioral and
   neural evidence for an intracultural advantage (better performance for
   same- vs. other-culture) in mental state decoding in a sample of native
   Japanese and white American participants. We examined the neural
   correlates of this intracultural advantage using fMRI, revealing greater
   bilateral posterior superior temporal sulci recruitment during same-
   versus other-culture mental state decoding in both cultural groups.
   These findings offer preliminary support for cultural consistency in the
   neurological architecture subserving high-level mental state reasoning,
   as well as its differential recruitment based on cultural group
   membership.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VISION}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},
Abstract = {{Psychological models suggest that perceptual similarity can be divided
   into geometric effects, such as metric distance in stimulus space, and
   non-geometric effects, such as stimulus-specific biases. We investigated
   the neural and temporal separability of these effects in a carry-over,
   event-related potential (ERP) study of facial similarity. By testing
   this dual effects model against a temporal framework of visual evoked
   components, we demonstrate that the behavioral distinction between
   geometric and non-geometric similarity effects is consistent with
   dissociable neural responses across the time course of face perception.
   We find an ERP component between the ``face-selective{''} N170 and N250
   responses (the ``P200{''}) that is modulated by transitions of face
   appearance, consistent with neural adaptation to the geometric
   similarity of face transitions. In contrast, the N170 and N250 reflect
   non-geometric stimulus bias, with different degrees of neural adaptation
   dependent upon the direction of transition within the stimulus space.
   These results suggest that the neural coding of perceptual similarity,
   in terms of both geometric and non-geometric representations, occurs
   rapidly and from relatively early in the perceptual processing stream.}},

   causes are less important and psycho-social problems become more and

   results of functional magnetic resonance tomography of the last ten
   years support this model by demonstrating the pain-processing structures

Abstract = {{Background: Present evidence suggests that the hippocampus (HC) and the
   parahippocampal cortex (PHC) are involved in allocentric
   (world-centered) spatial memory. However, the putative role of the PHC
   in egocentric (body-centered) spatial learning has received only limited
   systematic investigation.
   Methods: To examine the role of the PHC in egocentric learning, 19
   healthy volunteers learned to find their way in a virtual maze during
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The virtual maze presented
   a first-person view, lacked any topographical landmarks and could be
   learned only using egocentric navigation strategies.
   Results: During learning, increased medial temporal lobe activity was
   observed in the PHC bilaterally. Activity was also observed in cortical
   areas known to project to the PHC and proposed to contribute to
   egocentric spatial navigation and memory.
   Conclusions: Our results point to a role of the PHC for the
   representation and storage of egocentric information. It seems possible
   that the PHC contributes to egocentric memory by its feedback
   projections to the posterior parietal cortex. Moreover, access to
   allocentric and egocentric streams of spatial information may enable the
   PHC to construct a global and comprehensive representation of spatial
   environments and to promote the construction of stable cognitive maps by
   translating between egocentric and allocentric frames of memory. (C)

Abstract = {{Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder, and risk genes are
   thought to act through disruption of brain development. Several genetic
   studies have identified dystrobrevin binding protein 1 (DTNBP1, also
   known as dysbindin) as a potential susceptibility gene for
   schizophrenia, but its impact on brain function is poorly understood. it
   has been proposed that DTNBP1 may be associated with differences in
   visual processing. To test this, we examined the impact on visual
   processing in 61 healthy children aged 10-12 years of a genetic variant
   in DTNBP1 (rs2619538) that was common to all schizophrenia associated
   haplotypes in an earlier UK-Irish Study. We tested the hypothesis that
   carriers of the risk allele would show altered occipital cortical
   function relative to noncarriers. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
   (fMRI) was used to measure brain responses during a visual matching
   task. The data were analysed using statistical parametric mapping and
   statistical inferences were made at p<0.05 (corrected for multiple
   comparisons). Relative to noncarriers, carriers of the risk allele had
   greater activation in the lingual, fusiform gyrus and inferior occipital
   gyri. In these regions DTNBP1 genotype accounted for 19\%, 20\% and 14\%
   of the inter-individual variance, respectively. Our results suggest that
   that genetic variation in DTNBP1 is associated with differences in the
   function of brain areas that mediate Visual processing, and that these
   effects are evident in young children. These findings are consistent
   with the notion that the DTNBP1 gene influences brain development and
   can thereby modulate vulnerability to schizophrenia. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The relative contribution of dominant and non-dominant language networks
   to recovery from aphasia is a matter of debate. We assessed with
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to what extent the left and
   right hemispheres are associated with recovery from aphasia after
   stroke. fMRI with three language tasks was performed in 13 aphasic
   stroke patients and in 13 healthy subjects. Severity of aphasia was
   examined within 2 months after stroke and after at least 1 year.
   Recovery of naming ability and scores on the Token Test were correlated
   with data from fMRI in the chronic phase. A breath-hold paradigm was
   used to investigate hemodynamic responsiveness.
   Overall language performance in the chronic phase correlated with higher
   relative activation of left compared to right perisylvian areas.
   Recovery of naming ability was positively correlated with activation in
   the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) for semantic decision and verb
   generation. Recovery on the Token Test was positively correlated with
   activation in both left and right IFG during semantic decision and verb
   generation. Hemodynamic response to the breath-hold task was similar in
   patients and controls.
   Our study suggests that in the chronic stage after stroke left IFG
   activity is associated with improvement of picture naming and sentence
   comprehension, whereas activity in the right IFG may reflect
   up-regulation of non-linguistic cognitive processing. Altered
   hemodynamic responsiveness seems an unlikely confounder in the
   interpretations of fMRI results. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies have consistently identified a network of brain
   regions subserving inferences of other humans' mental states. This
   network consists of the superior temporal sulcus, temporoparietal
   junction, medial prefrontal cortex, temporal poles, and precuneus.
   Little is known, however, about the neural substrate underlying Theory
   of Mind processes in close to real-life conditions. To investigate those
   processes in more naturalistic settings, we used an fMRI adaption of the
   video-based Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC; Dziobek
   et al., 2006), which considers separate analysis of implicit mental
   state reasoning during rapidly changing perceptual cues as demanded in
   naturalistic settings and explicit mental state reasoning. We analyzed
   fMRI data by means of both a standard general linear model (GLM)
   approach and a tensor probabilistic independent component analysis
   (T-PICA), which is a novel model-free approach that allows decomposition
   of activation into independent spatio-temporally coherent functional
   networks. The model-based GLM approach revealed the typical explicit
   mental state reasoning network, Complementary to the GLM approach, the
   model-free T-PICA approach showed that those regions are also recruited
   during implicit mental state reasoning and that they are represented in
   three independent, functionally connected networks. The first component,
   mediating face processing and recognition, comprises the
   occipito-parietotemporal cortices, while the second component, involved
   in language comprehension, comprises the temporal lobes, lateral
   prefrontal cortex, and precuneus. The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and
   the precuneus comprise the third component, which is likely responsible
   for self-referential mental activity.
   These results show that the mental state reasoning network can be
   decomposed into circumscribed functional networks mediating differential
   aspects of Theory of Mind. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Perception of fearful faces is associated with functional activation of
   cortico-limbic structures, which has been found altered in individuals
   with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, autism and major
   depression. The objective of this study was to isolate the brain
   response to the features of standardized fearful faces by incorporating
   principal component analysis (PCA) into the analysis of neuroimaging
   data of healthy volunteers and individuals with schizophrenia. At the
   first stage, the visual characteristics of morphed fearful facial
   expressions (FEEST, Young et al., 2002) were classified with PCA, which
   produced seven orthogonal factors, with some of them related to
   emotionally salient facial features (eyes, mouth, brows) and others
   reflecting non-salient facial features. Subsequently, these PCA-based
   factors were included into the functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) analysis of 63 healthy volunteers and 32 individuals with
   schizophrenia performing a task that involved implicit processing of
   FEEST stimuli. In healthy volunteers, significant neural response was
   found to visual characteristics of eyes, mouth or brows. In individuals
   with schizophrenia, PCA-based analysis enabled us to identify several
   significant clusters of activation that were not detected by the
   standard approach. These clusters were implicated in processing of
   visual and emotional information and were attributable to the perception
   of eyes and brows. PCA-based analysis could be useful in isolating brain
   response to salient facial features in psychiatric populations. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Schizophrenia is associated with fronto-temporal dysconnectivity, but it
   is not clear whether this is a risk factor for the disorder or is a
   consequence of the established illness. The aim of the present Study was
   to use fMRI to investigate fronto-temporal connectivity in subjects with
   prodromal signs of schizophrenia using the Hayling Sentence Completion
   Task (HSCT). Thirty participants, 15 with an at risk mental state (ARMS)
   and 15 healthy controls were scanned whilst completing 80 sentence
   stems. The congruency and constraint of sentences varied across trials.
   Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) and Bayesian model selection (BMS) were
   used to compare alternative models of connectivity in a task related
   network. During the HSCT ARMS subjects did not differ from Healthy
   Controls in terms of fronto-temporal activation, i.e. there was neither
   a main effect of group nor a group-by-task interaction. However, there
   was both a significant main effect of group and a significant
   interaction in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), with greater ACC
   activity in the ARMS subjects. A systematic BMS procedure among 14
   alternative DCMs including the ACC, middle frontal, and middle temporal
   gyri revealed intact task-dependent modulation of fronto-temporal
   effective connectivity in the ARMS group. However, ARMS subjects showed
   increased endogenous connection strength between the ACC and the middle
   temporal gyrus relative to healthy controls. Although task related
   fronto-ternporal integration in the ARMS was intact, this may depend on
   increased engagement of the ACC which was not observed in healthy
   control subjects. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Traumatic brain injuries represent the leading cause of death and
   disability in young adults in industrialized countries. Recently, it has
   been suggested that dysfunctions of the frontomedian cortex, which
   enables social cognition, are responsible for clinical deficits in the
   long-term. To validate this hypothesis, we examined brain activation in
   seven young adults suffering from diffuse axonal injury during a
   cognitive task that specifically depends on frontomedian structures,
   namely evaluative judgments, contrasted with semantic memory retrieval.
   Brain activation in patients was compared with healthy age and gender
   matched control subjects using event-related functional magnetic
   resonance imaging. Evaluative judgments were related to a neural network
   discussed in the context of self-referential processing and theory of
   mind. More precisely, the neural network consisted of frontomedian
   regions, the temporal pole, and the posterior superior temporal gyrus
   and sulcus/angular gyrus. Patients showed higher activations in this
   network and the inferior frontal gyrus, whereas healthy control subjects
   activated more dopaminergic structures, namely the ventral tegmental
   area, during evaluative judgments. One possible interpretation of the
   data is that deficits in the ventral tegmental area, and consequently
   the mesocorticolimbic projection system, have to be compensated for by
   higher brain activations in the frontomedian and anterior cingulate
   cortex in patients with diffuse axonal injury. In conclusion, our study
   supports the hypothesis that traumatic brain injury is characterized by
   frontomedian dysfunctions, which may be responsible for clinical
   deficits in the long-term and which might be modified by rehabilitative
   strategies in the future. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aging impacts memory formation and the engagement of frontal and medial
   temporal regions. However, much of the research to date has focused on
   the encoding of neutral verbal and visual information. The present fMRI
   study investigated age differences in a social encoding task while
   participants made judgments about the self or another person. Although
   previous studies identified an intact self-reference effect with age,
   subserved by robust engagement of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) by
   both young and older adults, we identified a number of age differences.
   In regions including superior mPFC, inferior prefrontal cortex, and
   anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, young and older adults
   exhibited reversals in the pattern of activity for self and other
   conditions. Whereas young primarily evidenced subsequent forgetting
   effects in the self-reference condition, older adults demonstrated
   subsequent memory effects in the other-reference condition. These
   results indicate fundamental differences across the age groups in the
   engagement of elaborative encoding processes. We suggest that older
   adults may encode information about the self in a more normative manner,
   whereas young adults focus on encoding the unique aspects of the self
   and distinguishing the self from others. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Body orientation and eye gaze influence how information is conveyed
   during face-to-face communication. However, the neural pathways
   underpinning the comprehension of social cues in everyday interaction
   are not known. In this study we investigated the influence of addressing
   vs. non-addressing body orientation on the neural processing of speech
   accompanied by gestures.
   While in an fMRI scanner, participants viewed short video clips of an
   actor speaking sentences with object- (O; e.g., shape) or person-related
   content (P; e.g., saying goodbye) accompanied by iconic (e.g., circle)
   or emblematic gestures (e.g., waving), respectively. The actor's body
   was oriented either toward the participant (frontal, F) or toward a
   third person (lateral, L) not visible.
   For frontal vs. lateral actor orientation (F > L), we observed
   activation of bilateral occipital, inferior frontal, medial frontal,
   right anterior temporal and left parietal brain regions. Additionally,
   we observed activity in the occipital and anterior temporal lobes due to
   an interaction effect between actor orientation and content of the
   communication (PF > PL) > (OF > OL).
   Our findings indicate that social cues influence the neural processing
   of speech-gesture utterances. Mentalizing (the process of inferring the
   mental state of another individual) could be responsible for these
   effects. in particular, socially relevant cues seem to activate regions
   of the anterior temporal lobes if abstract person-related content is
   communicated by speech and gesture. These new findings illustrate the
   complexity of interpersonal communication, as our data demonstrate that
   multisensory information pathways interact at both perceptual and
   semantic levels. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A widely adopted neural model of face perception (Haxby, Hoffman, \&
   Gobbini, 2000) proposes that the posterior superior temporal sulcus
   (STS) represents the changeable features of a face, while the
   face-responsive fusiform gyrus (FFA) encodes invariant aspects of facial
   structure. `Changeable features' of a face can include rigid and
   non-rigid movements. The current study investigated neural responses to
   rigid, moving faces displaying shifts in social attention. Both
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography
   (MEG) were used to investigate neural responses elicited when
   participants viewed video clips in which actors made a rigid shift of
   attention, signalled congruently from both the eyes and head. These
   responses were compared to those elicited by viewing static faces
   displaying stationary social attention information or a scrambled video
   displaying directional motion. Both the fMRI and MEG analyses
   demonstrated heightened responses along the STS to turning heads
   compared to static faces or scrambled movement conditions. The FFA
   responded to both turning heads and static faces, showing only a slight
   increase in response to the dynamic stimuli. These results establish the
   applicability of the Haxby model to the perception of rigid face motions
   expressing changes in social attention direction. Furthermore, the MEG
   beamforming analyses found an STS response in an upper frequency band
   (30-80 Hz) which peaked in the right anterior region. These findings,
   derived from two complementary neuroimaging techniques, clarify the
   contribution of the STS during the encoding of rigid facial action
   patterns of social attention, emphasising the role of anterior sulcal
   regions alongside previously observed posterior areas. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Irritability, together with depression and anxiety, form three salient
   clinical features of pre-symptomatic Huntington's disease (HD). To date,
   the understanding of irritability in HD suffers from a paucity of
   experimental data and is largely based on questionnaires or clinical
   anecdotes. Factor analysis suggests that irritability is related to
   impulsivity and aggression and is likely to engage the same neuronal
   circuits as these behaviours, including areas such as medial
   orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and amygdala.
   16 pre-symptomatic gene carriers (PSCs) and 15 of their companions were
   asked to indicate the larger of two squares consecutively shown on a
   screen while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   Despite correct identification of the larger square, participants were
   often told that they or their partner had given the wrong answer. Size
   differences were subtle to make negative feedback credible but
   detectable.
   Although task performance, baseline irritability, and reported
   task-induced irritation were the same for both groups, fMRI revealed
   distinct neuronal processing in those who will later develop HD. In
   controls but not PSCs, task-induced irritation correlated positively
   with amygdala activation and negatively with OFC activation. Repetitive
   negative feedback induced greater amygdala activations in controls than
   PSCs. In addition, the inverse functional coupling between amygdala and
   OFC was significantly weaker in PSCs compared to controls.
   Our results argue that normal emotion processing circuits are disrupted
   in PSCs via attenuated modulation of emotional status by external or
   internal indicators. At later stages, this dysfunction may increase the
   risk for developing recognised, HD-associated, psychiatric symptoms such
   as irritability. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Serotonergic and noradrenergic pathways are the main targets of
   antidepressants. Their differential effects on emotion
   processing-related brain activation are, however, to be further
   characterized. We aimed at elucidating the neural sites of action of an
   acute differential serotonergic and noradrenergic influence on an
   emotion-processing task, which was earlier shown to be associated with
   depressiveness. In a single-blind pseudo-randomized crossover study, 21
   healthy subjects (16 subjects finally included in the analysis)
   participated to ingest a single dose at three time points of either 40
   mg citalopram, a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor, 8mg reboxetine,
   a selective noradrenaline-reuptake inhibitor, or placebo 2-3 h before
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). During fMRI, subjects
   performed a task comprising the anticipation and perception of pictures
   of either `known' (positive, negative, neutral) or `unknown' valence
   (randomly 50\% positive or negative). In direct comparison with
   citalopram and with placebo, reboxetine increased brain activity in the
   medial thalamus. Citalopram modulated certain prefrontal and insular
   areas more prominently. Other frontal and parieto-occipital areas were
   modulated by both drugs. In conclusion, the functional network involved
   in emotional information processing could be modulated by the acute
   application of selective noradrenergic and serotonergic drugs revealing
   a noradrenergic effect in thalamic and frontal areas, and a prefrontal
   and insular focus of serotonergic modulation. These findings could have
   implications for future selection criteria concerning personalized
   antidepressant medication in depression. Neuropsychopharmacology (2010)

Abstract = {{Empathy is a multidimensional construct and comprises the ability to
   perceive, understand and feet the emotional states of others. Gender
   differences have been reported for various aspects of emotional and
   cognitive behaviors including theory of mind. However, although empathy
   is not a single ability but a complex behavioral competency including
   different components, most studies relied on single aspects of empathy,
   such as perspective taking or emotion perception. To extend those
   findings we developed three paradigms to assess all three core
   components of empathy (emotion recognition, perspective taking and
   affective responsiveness) and clarify to which extent gender affects the
   neural correlates of empathic abilities. A functional MRI study was
   performed with 12 females (6 during their follicular phase, 6 during
   their luteal phase) and 12 mates, measuring these tasks as well as
   self-report empathy questionnaires.
   Data analyses revealed no significant gender differences in behavioral
   performance, but females rated themselves as more empathic than mates in
   the self-report questionnaires. Analyses of functional data revealed
   distinct neural networks in females and mates, and females showed
   stronger neural activation across all. three empathy tasks in
   emotion-related areas, including the amygdala. Exploratory analysis of
   possible hormonal effects indicated stronger amygdala activation in
   females during their follicular phase supporting previous data
   suggesting higher social sensitivity and thus facilitated
   socio-emotional behavior. Hence, our data support the assumption that
   females and mates rely on divergent processing strategies when solving
   emotional tasks: while females seem to recruit more emotion and
   self-related regions, mates activate more cortical, rather
   cognitive-related areas. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Parental responsiveness to infant vocalizations is an essential
   mechanism to ensure parental care, and its importance is reflected in a
   specific neural substrate, the thalamocingulate circuit, which evolved
   through mammalian evolution subserving this responsiveness. Recent
   studies using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) provide
   compelling evidence for a comparable mechanism in humans by showing
   thalamocingulate responses to infant crying. Furthermore, possibly
   acting on this common neural substrate, steroid hormones such as
   estradiol and testosterone, seem to mediate parental behavior both in
   humans and other animals. Estradiol unmistakably increases parental
   care, while data for testosterone are less unequivocal. In humans and
   several other animals, testosterone levels decrease both in mothers and
   fathers during parenthood. However, exogenous testosterone in mice seems
   to increase parenting, and infant crying leads to heightened
   testosterone levels in human mates. Not only is the way in which
   testosterone is implicated in parental responsiveness unresolved, but
   the underlying mechanisms are fully unknown. Accordingly, using fMRI, we
   measured neural responses of 16 young women who were listening to crying
   infants in a double blind, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced,
   testosterone administration experiment. Crucially, heightened activation
   in the testosterone condition compared to placebo was shown in the
   thalamocingulate region, insula, and the cerebellum in response to
   crying. Our results by controlled hormonal manipulation confirm a role
   of the thalamocingulate circuit in infant cry perception. Furthermore,
   the data also suggest that exogenous testosterone, by itself or by way
   of its metabolite estradiol, in our group of young women acted on this
   thalamocinculate circuit to, provisionally, upregulate parental care.

   they should also inquire into the rhetoric of neuroscience (how
   neuroscience research findings are framed rhetorically). This two-sided
   approach can help rhetoric scholars to use neuroscience insights in a
   responsible manner, minimizing analytical pitfalls. These two approaches
   can be combined to examine neuroscience discussions about methodology,

Abstract = {{With the aim of understanding how different mental or intentional states
   are processed in the brain, the present functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) study examined the brain correlates during the ascription
   of belief intentional states relative to desire intentional states as
   well as the effect of incongruent relative to congruent intentional
   states. To this end, sentences containing scenarios were presented to
   participants and their task was to make judgments concerning the
   ascription of intentional states based on this information. Belief
   ascriptions, relative to desire ascriptions, were accompanied by
   activations in lateral prefrontal structures that include areas known to
   be involved in relational and conceptual reasoning. Desire ascriptions,
   in contrast, were accompanied by activations in regions of the medial
   prefrontal cortex, superior temporal gyri and hippocampal formation, all
   of which are known for their involvement in self-referential,
   autobiographical and episodic memory-relevant processes. In addition,
   the ascription of intentional states that were incongruent with reality
   (false beliefs and unfulfilled desires) was compared to the ascription
   of intentional states that were congruent to reality (true belief and
   fulfilled desires). While no brain region was selectively activated
   during the processing of unfulfilled desires, the processing of false
   beliefs was associated with stronger activations in the dorsal medial
   prefrontal cortex, an area that has been previously linked to the
   process of decoupling in false belief attribution. These findings
   provide new insights into more fine-grained aspects of mental state
   reasoning.}},

Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{40-58}},
Abstract = {{Motion smoothness is critical in transmitting implicit information of
   body action, such as aesthetic qualities in dance performances. We
   expected that the perception of motion smoothness would be characterized
   by great intersubject variability deriving from differences in personal
   backgrounds and attitudes toward expressive body actions. We used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging and a humanoid robot to
   investigate the effects of the motion smoothness of expressive body
   actions and the intersubject variability due to personal attitudes on
   perceptions during dance observation. The effect of motion smoothness
   was analyzed by both conventional subtraction analysis and functional
   connectivity analyses that detect cortical networks reflecting
   intersubject variability. The results showed that the cortical networks
   of motion- and body-sensitive visual areas showed increases in activity
   in areas corresponding with motion smoothness, but the intersubject
   variability of personal attitudes toward art did not influence these
   active areas. In contrast, activation of cortical networks, including
   the parieto-frontal network, has large intersubject variability, and
   this variability is associated with personal attitudes about the
   consciousness of art. Thus, our results suggest that activity in the
   cortical network involved in understanding action is influenced by
   personal attitudes about the consciousness of art during observations of
   expressive body actions.}},

   emotional prosodic processing}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{59-75}},
Abstract = {{The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is functionally linked to a variety of
   cognitive and emotional functions. In particular, lesions of the human
   OFC lead to large-scale changes in social and emotional behavior. For
   example, patients with OFC lesions are reported to suffer from deficits
   in affective decision-making, including impaired emotional face and
   voice expression recognition (e.g., Hornak et al., 1996, 2003). However,
   previous studies have failed to acknowledge that emotional processing is
   a multistage process. Thus, different stages of emotional processing
   (e.g., early vs. late) in the same patient group could be affected in a
   qualitatively different manner. The present study investigated this
   possibility and tested implicit emotional speech processing in an ERP
   experiment followed by an explicit behavioral emotional recognition
   task. OFC patients listened to vocal emotional expressions of anger,
   fear, disgust, and happiness compared to a neutral baseline spoken
   either with or without lexical content. In line with previous evidence
   (Paulmann Kotz, 2008b), both patients and healthy controls differentiate
   emotional and neutral prosody within 200 ms (P200). However, the
   recognition of emotional vocal expressions is impaired in OFC patients
   as compared to healthy controls. The current data serve as first
   evidence that emotional prosody processing is impaired only at a late,
   and not at an early processing stage in OFC patients.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{76-91}},
Abstract = {{Prediction error, the difference between an expected and an actual
   outcome, serves as a learning signal that interacts with reward and
   punishment value to direct future behavior during reinforcement
   learning. We hypothesized that similar learning and valuation signals
   may underlie social expectancy violations. Here, we explore the neural
   correlates of social expectancy violation signals along the universal
   person-perception dimensions trait warmth and competence. In this
   context, social learning may result from expectancy violations that
   occur when a target is inconsistent with an a priori schema. Expectancy
   violation may activate neural regions normally implicated in prediction
   error and valuation during appetitive and aversive conditioning. Using
   fMRI, we first gave perceivers high warmth or competence behavioral
   information that led to dispositional or situational attributions for
   the behavior. Participants then saw pictures of people responsible for
   the behavior; they represented social groups either inconsistent (rated
   low on either warmth or competence) or consistent (rated high on either
   warmth or competence) with the behavior information. Warmth and
   competence expectancy violations activate striatal regions that
   represent evaluative and prediction error signals. Social cognition
   regions underlie consistent expectations. These findings suggest that
   regions underlying reinforcement learning may work in concert with
   social cognition regions in warmth and competence social expectancy.
   This study illustrates the neural overlap between neuroeconomics and
   social neuroscience.}},

Title = {{Training of affect recognition in schizophrenia: Neurobiological
   correlates}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{92-104}},
Abstract = {{Recently, a standardized program for training of affect recognition
   (TAR) was developed which has demonstrated efficacy and specificity with
   respect to behavioral performance. The effects of the TAR on the
   cerebral correlates were evaluated using repeated fMRI event-related
   measurements in a group of schizophrenia patients (n=10) before and
   after TAR treatment six weeks apart. A second patient group without
   training (n=10, treatment as usual, TAU) as well as healthy subjects
   (n=10) were investigated at equivalent time points. Schizophrenia
   patients were shown to be differentially impaired in the identification
   of the emotional aspects of facial expressions (but not age
   discrimination) when compared with healthy participants. A specific
   improvement in the increased number of correct identifications was
   observed in trained patients only. In parallel, an increase in
   activation was noted in the left middle and superior occipital lobe, the
   right inferior and superior parietal cortex, and the inferior frontal
   cortex bilaterally in TAR patients compared to the TAU group. These
   activation changes in TAR patients correlated with their behavioral
   improvement, further corroborating the positive effect of training.
   Specific training effects are seen to correspond with cerebral effects,
   probably reflecting a more efficient use of attentional, perceptual, or
   cognitive strategies.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{133-147}},
Abstract = {{How we are viewed by other individualsour reputationhas a considerable
   influence on our everyday behaviors and is considered an important
   concept in explaining altruism, a uniquely human trait. Previously it
   has been proposed that processing one's own reputation requires a
   reputation representation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and a
   value representation in the striatum. Here, we directly tested this idea
   using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Subjects disclosed
   their behavioral tendencies with reference to social norms in the
   presence or absence of other people, a manipulation that is known to
   greatly affect an individual's concern for their reputation. The mPFC
   showed strong activation during self-referential processing, and this
   activity was enhanced by the mere presence of observers. Moreover, the
   striatum was also strongly activated when subjects responded in front of
   observers. Thus, the present study demonstrated that the mPFC and
   striatum were automatically recruited when the task placed a high demand
   on processing how one is viewed by others. Taken together, our findings
   suggest that the mPFC and the striatum play a key role in regulating
   human social behaviors, and these results provide valuable insight into
   the neural basis of human altruism.}},

Title = {{Modulation of medial prefrontal and inferior parietal cortices when
   thinking about past, present, and future selves}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{187-200}},
Abstract = {{Recent functional neuroimaging studies have shown that reflecting on
   representations of the present self versus temporally distant selves is
   associated with higher activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC).
   In the current fMRI study, we investigated whether this effect of
   temporal perspective is symmetrical between the past and future. The
   main results revealed that the MPFC showed higher activity when
   reflecting on the present self than when reflecting on past and future
   selves, with no difference between past and future selves. Temporal
   perspective also modulated activity in the right inferior parietal
   cortex but in the opposite direction, activity in this brain region
   being higher when reflecting on past and future selves relative to the
   present self (with again no difference between past and future selves).
   These findings show that differences in brain activity when thinking
   about current versus temporally distant selves are symmetrical between
   the past and the future. It is suggested that by processing degrees of
   self-relatedness, the MPFC might sustain the process of identifying
   oneself with current representations of the self, whereas the right
   inferior parietal cortex might be involved in distinguishing the present
   self from temporally distant selves.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},

Pages = {{221-240}},
Abstract = {{Studies investigating the effects of violent computer and video game
   playing have resulted in heterogeneous outcomes. It has been assumed
   that there is a decreased ability to differentiate between virtuality
   and reality in people that play these games intensively. FMRI data of a
   group of young males with (gamers) and without (controls) a history of
   long-term violent computer game playing experience were obtained during
   the presentation of computer game and realistic video sequences. In
   gamers the processing of real violence in contrast to nonviolence
   produced activation clusters in right inferior frontal, left lingual and
   superior temporal brain regions. Virtual violence activated a network
   comprising bilateral inferior frontal, occipital, postcentral, right
   middle temporal, and left fusiform regions. Control participants showed
   extended left frontal, insula and superior frontal activations during
   the processing of real, and posterior activations during the processing
   of virtual violent scenarios. The data suggest that the ability to
   differentiate automatically between real and virtual violence has not
   been diminished by a long-term history of violent video game play, nor
   have gamers' neural responses to real violence in particular been
   subject to desensitization processes. However, analyses of individual
   data indicated that group-related analyses reflect only a small part of
   actual individual different neural network involvement, suggesting that
   the consideration of individual learning history is sufficient for the
   present discussion.}},

Title = {{Differential dorsal and ventral medial prefrontal representations of the
   implicit self modulated by individualism and collectivism: An fMRI study}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{257-271}},
Abstract = {{Individualism and collectivism, or self-construal style, refer to
   cultural values that influence how people think about themselves and
   their relation to the social and physical environment. Recent
   neuroimaging evidence suggests that cultural values of individualism and
   collectivism dynamically modulate neural response within cortical
   midline structures, such as the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and
   posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), during explicit self-evaluation.
   However, it remains unknown whether cultural priming modulates neural
   response during self-evaluation due to explicit task demands. Here we
   investigated how cultural priming of self-construal style affects neural
   activity within cortical midline structures during implicit
   self-evaluation in bicultural individuals. Results indicate that ventral
   MPFC showed relatively less deactivation during implicit evaluation of
   both self- and father-relevant information as compared to control
   condition (e.g., information of an unfamiliar person), irrespective of
   cultural priming. By contrast, dorsal MPFC showed relatively less
   deactivation during implicit evaluation of father-relevant information,
   but not self-relevant information, as compared to control condition,
   only when they were primed with individualism. Furthermore, dorsal MPFC
   showed relatively less deactivation during implicit evaluation of
   father-relevant information as compared to self-relevant condition only
   when they were primed with individualism. Hence, our results indicate
   that cultural priming modulates neural response within dorsal, but not
   ventral, portions of MPFC in a stimulus-driven rather than task-driven
   manner. More broadly, these findings suggest that cultural values
   dynamically shape neural representations during the evaluation, rather
   than the detection, of self-relevant information.}},

Title = {{Neural activation in the oreward circuito shows a nonlinear response to
   facial attractiveness}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{320-334}},
Abstract = {{Positive behavioral responses to attractive faces have led
   neuroscientists to investigate underlying neural mechanisms in a oreward
   circuito that includes brain regions innervated by dopamine pathways.
   Using male faces ranging from attractive to extremely unattractive,
   disfigured ones, this study is the first to demonstrate heightened
   responses to both rewarding and aversive faces in numerous areas of this
   putative reward circuit. Parametric analyses employing orthogonal linear
   and nonlinear regressors revealed positive nonlinear effects in anterior
   cingulate cortex, lateral orbital frontal cortex (LOFC), striatum
   (nucleus accumbens, caudate, putamen), and ventral tegmental area, in
   addition to replicating previously documented linear effects in medial
   orbital frontal cortex (MOFC) and LOFC and nonlinear effects in amygdala
   and MOFC. The widespread nonlinear responses are consistent with single
   cell recordings in animals showing responses to both rewarding and
   aversive stimuli, and with some human fMRI investigations of non-face
   stimuli. They indicate that the reward circuit does not process face
   valence with any simple dissociation of function across structures.
   Perceiver gender modulated some responses to our male faces: Women
   showed stronger linear effects, and men showed stronger nonlinear
   effects, which may have functional implications. Our discovery of
   nonlinear responses to attractiveness throughout the reward circuit
   echoes the history of amygdala research: Early work indicated a linear
   response to threatening stimuli, including faces; later work also
   revealed a nonlinear response with heightened activation to affectively
   salient stimuli regardless of valence. The challenge remains to
   determine how such dual coding influences feelings, such as pleasure and
   pain, and guides goal-related behavioral responses, such as approach and
   avoidance.}},

Abstract = {{In everyday life causal attribution is important in order to structure

   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 30 healthy subjects to
   separate the neural correlates of self vs. external responsibility for
   social events and explore the neural basis of self-serving attributions
   (internal attributions of positive events and external attributions of
   negative events). We presented short sentences describing positive and
   negative social events and asked participants to imagine the event, to
   decide the main cause and assign it to one of the categories (internal
   vs. external). FMRI data were analyzed using a 2 x 2 factorial design
   with the factors emotional valence and attribution. Internal compared to
   external attribution revealed activations along the right
   temporoparietal junction (TPJ). The reverse contrast showed a left
   lateralized network mainly involving the TPJ, the precuneus and the
   superior/medial frontal gyrus. These results confirmed the involvement
   of a fronto-temporoparietal network in differentiating self and external
   responsibility. Analysis of the self-serving bias yielded activation in
   the dorsal anterior cingulate and in the dorsal striatum, suggesting a
   rewarding value of these attributions.}},

Title = {{When your errors make me lose or win: Event-related potentials to
   observed errors of cooperators and competitors}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{360-374}},
Abstract = {{Monitoring one's own errors is a fundamental ability in terms of guiding
   and improving behavior, with specific neural substrates in the anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC). Similarly, we can monitor others' actions and
   learn by observing their errors. The mirror neuron system may subserve
   the formation of shared representations for self-generated and observed
   actions, and recent research suggests that monitoring mechanisms also
   react to errors made by others. However, it remains unknown how these
   responses are modified when interpersonal context implies different
   goals for the actor and the observer. To investigate whether differences
   in social context can influence brain response to observed action
   errors, we manipulated competition vs. cooperation between two
   participants taking turns in a go/no-go task. Event-related potentials
   simultaneously recorded from both participants showed a typical
   negativity over frontocentral regions to self-generated errors,
   irrespective of interpersonal context, but early differential responses
   to other-generated errors only during cooperation, with sources in
   precuneus and medial premotor areas. Competition produced a distinct
   error-related negativity in ACC at later latencies. We conclude that
   error monitoring for others' actions depends on their congruence with
   personal goals, and recruits brain systems involved in self-referential
   processing specifically during cooperation.}},

Abstract = {{Social psychological and developmental research revealed that imitation
   serves a fundamental social function. It has been shown that human
   beings have the tendency to automatically mirror the behavior of
   othersthe so-called chameleon effect. Furthermore, it has been
   demonstrated that being imitated leads to positive feelings toward the
   imitator. But why do we feel more positive about someone who imitates
   us? In the current fMRI study we aimed at exploring the neural
   correlates of the positive consequences of being imitated by means of an
   observation paradigm. Our results indicate that being imitated compared
   to not being imitated activates brain areas that have been associated
   with emotion and reward processing, namely medial orbitofrontal
   cortex/ventromedial prefrontal cortex (mOFC/vmPFC, GLM whole-brain
   contrast). Moreover mOFC/vmPFC shows higher effective connectivity with
   striatum and mid-posterior insula during being imitated compared to not
   being imitated.}},

Abstract = {{Social acceptance is of key importance for healthy functioning. We used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine age-related
   changes in the neural correlates of social acceptance and rejection
   processing. Participants from four age groups participated in the study:
   pre-pubertal children (8-10 years), early adolescents (12-14 years),
   older adolescents (16-17 years) and young adults (19-25 years). During
   the experiment, participants were presented with unfamiliar faces of
   peers and were asked to predict whether they expected to be liked or
   disliked by the other person, followed by feedback indicating acceptance
   or rejection. Results showed that activation in the ventral mPFC and
   striatum to social feedback was context-dependent; there was increased
   activation when participants had positive expectations about social
   evaluation, and increased activation following social acceptance
   feedback. Age-related comparisons revealed a linear increase in activity
   with age in these brain regions for positive expectations of social
   evaluation. Similarly, a linear increase with age was found for
   activation in the striatum, ventral mPFC, OFC, and lateral PFC for
   rejection feedback. No age-related differences in neural activation were
   shown for social acceptance feedback. Together, these results provide
   important insights in the developmental trajectories of brain regions
   implicated in social and affective behavior.}},

Title = {{Witnessing peer rejection during early adolescence: Neural correlates of
   empathy for experiences of social exclusion}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{5-6}},
Pages = {{496-507}},
Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies with adults have begun to reveal the neural bases
   of empathy; however, this research has focused on empathy for physical
   pain, rather than empathy for negative social experiences. Moreover,
   this work has not examined adolescents who may frequently witness and
   empathize with others that experience negative social experiences such
   as peer rejection. Here, we examined neural activity among early
   adolescents observing social exclusion compared to observing inclusion,
   and how this activity related to both trait empathy and subsequent
   prosocial behavior. Participants were scanned while they observed an
   individual whom they believed was being socially excluded. At least one
   day prior to the scan they reported their trait empathy, and following
   the scan they wrote emails to the excluded victim that were rated for
   prosocial behavior (e.g., helping, comforting). Observing exclusion
   compared to inclusion activated regions involved in mentalizing (i.e.,
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex), particularly among highly empathic
   individuals. Additionally, individuals who displayed more activity in
   affective, pain-related regions during observed exclusion compared to
   inclusion subsequently wrote more prosocial emails to excluded victims.
   Overall findings suggest that when early adolescents witness social
   exclusion in their daily lives, some may actually `feel the pain' of the
   victims and act more prosocially toward them as a result.}},

Pages = {{508-518}},
Abstract = {{Family assistance is an important aspect of family relationships for
   adolescents across many cultures and contexts. Motivations to help
   family members may be driven by both cultural factors and early family
   experiences. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to
   examine (1) cultural differences in neural reward activity among White
   and Latino youth during online experiences of family assistance and (2)
   how prior family experiences related to neural reward activity when
   helping the family. Participants were scanned as they made decisions to
   contribute money to their family and themselves. Latino and White
   participants showed similar behavioral levels of helping but distinct
   patterns of neural activity within the mesolimbic reward system. Whereas
   Latino participants showed more reward activity when contributing to
   their family, White participants showed more reward activity when
   gaining cash for themselves. In addition, participants who felt more
   identified with their family and who derived greater fulfillment from
   helping their family two years prior to the scan showed increased reward
   system activation when contributing to their family. These results
   suggest that family assistance may be guided, in part, by the personal
   rewards one attains from that assistance, and that this sense of reward
   may be modulated by cultural influences and prior family experiences.}},

   adolescent girls}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{5-6}},
Pages = {{519-532}},
Abstract = {{Relational aggression is a type of aggression that aims to hurt others
   through relationships and includes behaviors such as gossip and
   ostracism. This type of aggression is very common among adolescent
   girls, and in its more intense forms has been linked with poor
   psychosocial outcomes, including depression and suicide. In the present
   study we investigated whether individual differences in sensitivity to
   relational aggression among adolescent girls predicted recruitment of
   neural networks associated with executive function and cognitive
   control. Neural response was measured using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging during an affect recognition task that included
   unfamiliar peer faces. A finding of relatively fewer reports of being
   victimized by relational aggression was associated with increased
   recruitment of bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortices as well as
   anterior and posterior cingulate cortices in response to the affect
   recognition task, as well as with greater competence on behavioral
   measures of executive function. Our results suggest that girls who are
   able to recruit specific frontal networks to improve cognitive and
   executive control are less sensitive to relational aggression.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{5-6}},
Pages = {{533-542}},
Abstract = {{Emotion regulation is a critical aspect of children's social
   development, yet few studies have examined the brain mechanisms involved
   in its development. Theoretical accounts have conceptualized emotion
   regulation as relying on prefrontal control of limbic regions,
   specifying the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as a key brain region.
   Functional magnetic resonance imaging in 5- to 11-year-olds during
   emotion regulation and processing of emotionally expressive faces
   revealed that older children preferentially recruited the more dorsal
   ocognitiveo areas of the ACC, while younger children preferentially
   engaged the more ventral oemotionalo areas. Additionally, children with
   more fearful temperaments exhibited more ventral ACC activity while less
   fearful children exhibited increased activity in the dorsal ACC. These
   findings provide insight into a potential neurobiological mechanism
   underlying well-documented behavioral and cognitive changes from more
   emotional to more cognitive regulatory strategies with increasing age,
   as well as individual differences in this developmental process as a
   function of temperament. Our results hold important implications for our
   understanding of normal development and should also help to inform our
   understanding and management of emotional disorders.}},

Abstract = {{The recognition of emotional expressions is an important skill and
   relates to social functioning and adjustment in childhood. The current
   functional MRI study investigated the neural processing of angry and
   happy facial expressions in 5- to 6-year-old children and in adults.
   Participants were presented happy and angry faces of adults and children
   while they performed a non-emotion-related task with low cognitive load.
   Very similar neural networks were involved in the processing of angry
   and happy faces in adults and children, including the amygdala and
   prefrontal areas. In general, children showed heightened amygdala
   activation in response to emotional faces relative to adults. While
   children showed stronger amygdala activation in response to angry adult
   compared to angry child faces, adults showed stronger amygdala
   activation for angry child faces. In both age groups enhanced amygdala
   involvement was found for happy peer faces relative to happy non-peer
   faces, though this effect was only a tendency in adults. The findings
   are discussed in the context of the development of the social brain
   network.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{5-6}},
Pages = {{560-576}},
Abstract = {{Previous behavioral research has revealed a positivity effect that
   occurs with aging, with older adults focusing more on positive
   information and less on negative emotional stimuli as compared to young
   adults. Questions have been raised as to whether this effect exists in
   the rapid detection of information or whether it operates only at later
   stages of processing. In the present study, we used eye-tracking and
   neuroimaging methodologies to examine whether the two age groups
   accomplished the detection of emotional information on a visual search
   task using the same mechanisms. Eye-tracking results revealed no
   significant age differences in detection or viewing time of emotional
   targets as a function of valence. Despite their general similarity in
   task performance, neuroimaging results revealed an age-related
   valence-based reversal in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) activity, with
   detection of negative compared to positive targets activating the MPFC
   more for younger adults, and detection of positive compared to negative
   targets activating the MPFC more for older adults. These results suggest
   that age-related valence reversals in neural activity can exist even on
   tasks that require only relatively automatic processing of emotional
   information.}},

   known about the reliability of fMRI findings. First, we examine the many
   factors that influence the quality of acquired fMRI data. We also
   conduct a review of the existing literature to determine if some measure
   of agreement has emerged regarding the reliability of fMRI. Finally, we
   provide commentary on ways to improve fMRI reliability and what
   questions remain unanswered. Reliability is the foundation on which
   scientific investigation is based. How reliable are the results from

Abstract = {{In this review, we discuss how neuropsychological impairments in visual

   neuroanatomical and behavioral evidence on the disorders of neglect,

   in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC). This includes linking: (i)
   bottom-up attentional capture and the right temporo-parietal junction
   (TPJ); (ii) top-down segmentation of displays and the medial PPC; (iii)
   grouping, individuation and identification, and the inferior
   intra-parietal sulcus (IPS) bilaterally; and (iv) the suppression of
   saliency and the left IPS. In addition, when neuropsychological studies
   are combined with fMRI, there is evidence that these regions of the PPC
   interact with striate and extra-striate cortical areas, which respond to
   specific properties of stimuli. Selection should be viewed as an
   emergent property of a network of areas involving both ventral and

Abstract = {{Working memory (WM) shows pronounced age-related decline. Functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have revealed age differences
   in task-related brain activation. Evidence based primarily on episodic
   memory studies suggests that brain activation patterns can be modulated
   by task difficulty in both younger and older adults. In most fMRI aging
   studies on WM, however, performance level has not been considered, so
   that age differences in activation patterns are confounded with age
   differences in performance level. Here, we address this issue by
   comparing younger and older low and high performers in an event-related
   fMRI study. Thirty younger (20-30 years) and 30 older (60-70 years)
   healthy adults were tested with a spatial WM task with three load
   levels. A region-of-interest analysis revealed marked differences in the
   activation patterns between high and low performers in both age groups.
   Critically, among the older adults, a more ``youth-like'' load-dependent
   modulation of the blood oxygen level-dependent signal was associated
   with higher levels of spatial WM performance. These findings underscore
   the need of taking performance level into account when studying changes
   in functional brain activation patterns from early to late adulthood.}},

   Reward and Personal Relevance and Its Relation to Human Personality}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},

Month = {{DEC 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: The attribution of personal relevance, i.e. relating
   internal and external stimuli to establish a sense of belonging, is a
   common phenomenon in daily life. Although previous research demonstrated
   a relationship between reward and personal relevance, their exact
   neuronal relationship including the impact of personality traits remains
   unclear.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging, we applied an experimental paradigm that allowed us to explore
   the neural response evoked by reward and the attribution of personal
   relevance separately. We observed different brain regions previously
   reported to be active during reward and personal relevance, including
   the bilateral caudate nucleus and the pregenual anterior cingulate
   cortex (PACC). Additional analysis revealed activations in the right and
   left insula specific for the attribution of personal relevance.
   Furthermore, our results demonstrate a negative correlation between
   signal changes in both the PACC and the left anterior insula during the
   attribution of low personal relevance and the personality dimension
   novelty seeking.
   Conclusion/Significance: While a set of subcortical and cortical regions
   including the PACC is commonly involved in reward and personal
   relevance, other regions like the bilateral anterior insula were
   recruited specifically during personal relevance. Based on our
   correlation between novelty seeking and signal changes in both regions
   during personal relevance, we assume that the neuronal response to
   personally relevant stimuli is dependent on the personality trait
   novelty seeking.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Clinical impressions and preclinical work suggest that
   posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) might be associated with
   dysfunctional reward processing. To pursue this issue, we administered a
   validated passive-viewing monetary reward task during functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to subjects with chronic PTSD and to
   mentally healthy individuals.
   \textbackslash{}Methods: The protocol evaluated fMRI signal changes that
   anticipated or accompanied monetary gains and losses under varying
   conditions of controlled expectation. The ``expectancy phase{''}
   entailed presentation of a promising, unpromising, or intermediate Wheel
   of Fortune-type spinner, whereas the ``outcome phase{''} was defined by
   the arrow landing on one of three sectors of that spinner, thereby
   determining the subjects' gain or loss for that trial.
   Results: Neuroimaging data from 20 PTSD and 26 healthy subjects
   withstood quality control procedures and were included. In voxelwise and
   anatomically defined region-of-interest analyses, when gains were
   contrasted to losses, between-group comparison revealed smaller
   bilateral striatal activations in the PTSD subjects. In the PTSD group,
   less striatal activation to gains versus losses was associated with more
   self-reported motivational and social deficits.
   Conclusions: The present data support the hypothesis that PTSD is
   associated with abnormal processing of monetary outcomes and that this
   alteration might be related to some aspects of emotional numbing.}},

Title = {{Neural Mechanisms of Cognitive Reappraisal of Negative Self-Beliefs in
   Social Anxiety Disorder}},

Abstract = {{Background: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by distorted
   negative self-beliefs (NSBs), which are thought to enhance emotional
   reactivity, interfere with emotion regulation, and undermine social
   functioning. Cognitive reappraisal is a type of emotion regulation used
   to alter NSBs, with the goal of modulating emotional reactivity. Despite
   its relevance, little is known about the neural bases and temporal
   features of cognitive reappraisal in patients with SAD.
   Methods: Twenty-seven patients with SAD and 27 healthy control subjects
   (HCs) were trained to react and to implement cognitive reappraisal to
   downregulate negative emotional reactivity to NSBs, while undergoing
   functional magnetic resonance imaging and providing ratings of negative
   emotion experience.
   Results: Behaviorally, compared with HCs, patients with SAD reported
   greater negative emotion both while reacting to and reappraising NSBs.
   However, when cued, participants in both groups were able to use
   cognitive reappraisal to decrease negative emotion. Neurally, reacting
   to NSBs resulted in early amygdala response in both groups. Reappraising
   NSBs resulted in greater early cognitive control, language, and visual
   processing in HCs but greater late cognitive control, visceral, and
   visual processing in patients with SAD. Functional connectivity analysis
   during reappraisal identified more regulatory regions inversely related
   to left amygdala in HCs than in patients with SAD. Reappraisal-related
   brain regions that differentiated patients and control subjects were
   associated with negative emotion ratings and cognitive reappraisal
   self-efficacy.
   Conclusions: Findings regarding cognitive reappraisal suggest neural
   timing, connectivity, and brain-behavioral associations specific to
   patients with SAD and elucidate neural mechanisms that might serve as
   biomarkers of interventions for SAD.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with the occurrence of white
   matter plaques in the central nervous system. These are frequently
   located in areas interconnecting areas associated with the processing of
   emotions. Although recent behavioral studies indicated social and
   affective disturbances in many of these patients, functional studies
   investigating specific emotional recognition in MS are lacking.
   We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and lesion mapping
   in MS-patients to investigate correlates between these measures and
   emotional facial recognition. Eleven patients whose affective ability
   was impaired were compared with eleven unimpaired MS-patients and eleven
   healthy controls (HCs) using a facial expression matching task.
   Decreased recognition performance was limited to the detection of
   unpleasant facial expressions (sad, fearful, angry). In evaluating the
   functional activation maps for the unpleasant facial expressions, we
   found decreased insular and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC)
   activation in the impaired group versus the unimpaired groups. We found
   a close relationship between the inability of solving the task and
   decreased activation of the left VLPFC and the left anterior insula. In
   addition, we found a correlation between decreased performance accuracy
   and the presence of lesions in the left temporal white matter.
   These data suggest that emotion recognition deficits in MS-patients
   might be due to the interruption of processing emotionally relevant
   information, which leads to decreased activation of the VLPFC and the
   insula. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Amygdala temporal dynamics: temperamental differences in the timing of
   amygdala response to familiar and novel faces}},
Journal = {{BMC NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Inhibited temperament - the predisposition to respond to new
   people, places or things with wariness or avoidance behaviors - is
   associated with increased risk for social anxiety disorder and major
   depression. Although the magnitude of the amygdala's response to novelty
   has been identified as a neural substrate of inhibited temperament,
   there may also be differences in temporal dynamics (latency, duration,
   and peak). We hypothesized that persons with inhibited temperament would
   have faster responses to novel relative to familiar neutral faces
   compared to persons with uninhibited temperament. We used event-related
   functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure the temporal dynamics
   of the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response to both novel and
   familiar neutral faces in participants with inhibited or uninhibited
   temperament.
   Results: Inhibited participants had faster amygdala responses to novel
   compared with familiar faces, and both longer and greater amygdala
   response to all faces. There were no differences in peak response.
   Conclusion: Faster amygdala response to novelty may reflect a
   computational bias that leads to greater neophobic responses and
   represents a mechanism for the development of social anxiety.}},

Abstract = {{Symbolic gestures, such as pantomimes that signify actions (e. g.,
   threading a needle) or emblems that facilitate social transactions (e.
   g., finger to lips indicating ``be quiet''), play an important role in
   human communication. They are autonomous, can fully take the place of
   words, and function as complete utterances in their own right. The
   relationship between these gestures and spoken language remains unclear.
   We used functional MRI to investigate whether these two forms of
   communication are processed by the same system in the human brain.
   Responses to symbolic gestures, to their spoken glosses (expressing the
   gestures' meaning in English), and to visually and acoustically matched
   control stimuli were compared in a randomized block design. General
   Linear Models (GLM) contrasts identified shared and unique activations
   and functional connectivity analyses delineated regional interactions
   associated with each condition. Results support a model in which
   bilateral modality-specific areas in superior and inferior temporal
   cortices extract salient features from vocal-auditory and
   gestural-visual stimuli respectively. However, both classes of stimuli
   activate a common, left-lateralized network of inferior frontal and
   posterior temporal regions in which symbolic gestures and spoken words
   may be mapped onto common, corresponding conceptual representations. We
   suggest that these anterior and posterior perisylvian areas, identified
   since the mid-19th century as the core of the brain's language system,
   are not in fact committed to language processing, but may function as a
   modality-independent semiotic system that plays a broader role in human
   communication, linking meaning with symbols whether these are words,
   gestures, images, sounds, or objects.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with developmental prosopagnosia exhibit severe and lasting
   difficulties in recognizing faces despite the absence of apparent brain
   abnormalities. We used voxel-based morphometry to investigate whether
   developmental prosopagnosics show subtle neuroanatomical differences
   from controls. An analysis based on segmentation of T1-weighted images
   from 17 developmental prosopagnosics and 18 matched controls revealed
   that they had reduced grey matter volume in the right anterior inferior
   temporal lobe and in the superior temporal sulcus/middle temporal gyrus
   bilaterally. In addition, a voxel-based morphometry analysis based on
   the segmentation of magnetization transfer parameter maps showed that
   developmental prosopagnosics also had reduced grey matter volume in the
   right middle fusiform gyrus and the inferior temporal gyrus. Multiple
   regression analyses relating three distinct behavioural component
   scores, derived from a principal component analysis, to grey matter
   volume revealed an association between a component related to facial
   identity and grey matter volume in the left superior temporal
   sulcus/middle temporal gyrus plus the right middle fusiform
   gyrus/inferior temporal gyrus. Grey matter volume in the lateral
   occipital cortex was associated with component scores related to object
   recognition tasks. Our results demonstrate that developmental
   prosopagnosics have reduced grey matter volume in several regions known
   to respond selectively to faces and provide new evidence that integrity
   of these areas relates to face recognition ability.}},

Journal = {{CURRENT OPINION IN NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{594-600}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   Visualization of how the brain generates a lie is now possible because
   of recent conceptual and technical advances in functional neuroimaging;
   this has led to a rapid increase in studies related to the cognitive
   neuroscience of deception. The present review summarizes recent work on
   the neural substrates that underlie human deceptive behavior.
   Recent findings
   Functional neuroimaging studies in healthy individuals have revealed
   that the prefrontal cortex plays a predominant role in deception. In
   addition, recent evidence obtained from loss-of-function studies with
   neuropsychological investigation and transcranial direct current
   stimulation has demonstrated the functional contribution of the
   prefrontal cortex to deception. Other research into the relationship
   between deception and the brain has focused on the potential use of
   functional MRI for lie detection, neural correlates of pathological
   lying, and brain mechanisms underlying inference of deceit by others.
   Summary
   Converging evidence from multiple sources suggests that the prefrontal
   cortex organizes the processes of inhibiting true responses and making
   deceptive responses. The neural mechanisms underlying various other
   aspects of deception are also gradually being delineated, although the
   findings are diverse, and further study is needed. These studies
   represent an important step toward a neural explanation of complex human
   deceptive behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Effective goal-directed behavior relies on a network of regions
   including anterior cingulate cortex and ventral striatum to learn from
   negative outcomes in order to improve performance. We employed fMRI to
   determine if this frontal-striatal system is also involved in instances
   of behavior that do not presume negative circumstances. Participants
   performed a visual target/nontarget search game in which they could
   optionally abort a trial to avoid errors or receive extra reward for
   highly confident responses. Anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortex
   were equally activated for error avoidance and high reward trials but
   were not active on error trials, demonstrating their primary involvement
   in self-initiated behavioral adjustment and not error detection or
   prediction. In contrast, the insula and the ventral striatum were
   responsive to the high reward trials. Differential activation patterns
   across conditions for the nucleus accumbens, insula, and prefrontal
   cortex suggest distinct roles for these structures in the control of
   reward-related behavior.}},

   published September 30, 2009; doi:10.1152/jn.00515.2009. The visual
   properties of an object provide many cues as to the tensile strength,
   compliance, and density of the material from which it is made. However,
   it is not well understood how these implicit associations affect our
   perceptions of these properties and how they determine the initial
   forces that are applied when an object is picked up. Here we examine the
   effects of these cues on such forces by using the classic
   ``material-weight illusion{''} (MWI). Grip and load forces were measured
   in three experiments as participants lifted cubes made from metal, wood,
   and expanded polystyrene. These cubes were adjusted to have a different
   mass than would be expected for a particular material. For the initial
   lifts, the forces were scaled to the expected weight of each object,
   such that the metal block was gripped and lifted with more force than
   the polystyrene one. After a few lifts, however, participants scaled
   their forces to the actual weight of the blocks, implicitly disregarding
   the misleading visual cues to each block's composition ( experiments 1
   and 2). Despite this rapid rescaling, participants experienced a robust
   MWI throughout the duration of the experiments. In fact, the grip and
   load forces never matched the perception of weight until the differences
   in the visual surface properties between the blocks were removed (
   experiment 3). These findings are discussed in relation to recent
   debates about the underlying causes of weight-based illusions and the
   effect of top-down visual cues on perception and action.}},

   September 30, 2009; doi:10.1152/jn.91195.2008. Prediction error signals
   have been reported in human imaging studies in target areas of dopamine
   neurons such as ventral and dorsal striatum during learning with many
   different types of reinforcers. However, a key question that has yet to
   be addressed is whether prediction error signals recruit distinct or
   overlapping regions of striatum and elsewhere during learning with
   different types of reward. To address this, we scanned 17 healthy
   subjects with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they chose
   actions to obtain either a pleasant juice reward (1 ml apple juice), or
   a monetary gain (5 cents) and applied a computational reinforcement
   learning model to subjects' behavioral and imaging data. Evidence for an
   overlapping prediction error signal during learning with juice and money
   rewards was found in a region of dorsal striatum (caudate nucleus),
   while prediction error signals in a subregion of ventral striatum were
   significantly stronger during learning with money but not juice reward.
   These results provide evidence for partially overlapping reward
   prediction signals for different types of appetitive reinforcers within
   the striatum, a finding with important implications for understanding
   the nature of associative encoding in the striatum as a function of
   reinforcer type.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To determine whether Experience Corps (EC), a social service
   program, would improve age-vulnerable executive functions and increase
   activity in brain regions in a high-risk group through increased
   cognitive and physical activity.
   Methods. Eight community-dwelling, older female volunteers and nine
   matched wait-list controls were recruited to serve in the ongoing EC:
   Baltimore program in three elementary schools. We employed functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) preintervention and postintervention
   to examine whether EC volunteers improved executive function and showed
   increased activity in the prefrontal cortex relative to controls. fMRI
   volunteers were trained and placed with other volunteers 15 h/wk for 6
   months during the academic year to assist teachers in kindergarten
   through third grade to promote children's literacy and academic
   achievement.
   Results. Participants were African American and had low education, low
   income, and low Mini-Mental State Examination scores (M = 24),
   indicative of elevated risk for cognitive impairment. Volunteers
   exhibited intervention-specific increases in brain activity in the left
   prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex over the 6-month
   interval relative to matched controls. Neural gains were matched by
   behavioral improvements in executive inhibitory ability.
   Conclusions. Using fMRI, we demonstrated intervention-specific
   short-term gains in executive function and in the activity of prefrontal
   cortical regions in older adults at elevated risk for cognitive
   impairment. These pilot results provide proof of concept for
   use-dependent brain plasticity in later life, and, that interventions
   designed to promote health and function through everyday activity may
   enhance plasticity in key regions that support executive function.}},

Abstract = {{Neurophysiological and imaging procedures to measure brain activity,
   such as fMRI or EEG, are employed in neuroscience to investigate
   processes of functional specialisation and functional integration in the
   human brain. Functioal integration can be described in two distinct
   ways: functional connectivity and effective connectivity. Whereas
   functional connectivity merely describes the statistical dependence
   between two time series, the concept of effective connectivity requires
   a mechanistic model of the causative effects upon which the data to be
   observed are based. This article summarises the conceptual and
   methodological principles of modern techniques for the analysis of
   functional and effective connectivity on the basis of fMRI and
   electrophysiological data. Particular emphasis is placed on dynamic
   causal modelling (DCM), a new procedure for the analysis of non-linear
   neuronal systems. This method has a highly promising potential for
   clinical applications, e.g., for decoding pathological mechanisms in
   brain diseases and for the establishment of neurologically valid
   diagnostic classifications.}},

Abstract = {{Successful social interaction relies on multimodal integration of
   non-verbal emotional signals. The neural correlates of this function,
   along with those underlying the processing of human faces and voices,
   have been linked to the superior temporal sulcus (STS) in previous
   neuroimaging studies. Yet, recently it has been demonstrated that this
   structure consists of several anatomically defined sections, including a
   trunk section as well as two separate terminal branches, and exhibits a
   pronounced spatial variability across subjects. Using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we demonstrated that the neural
   representations of the audiovisual integration of non-verbal emotional
   signals, voice sensitivity and face sensitivity are located in different
   parts of the STS with maximum voice sensitivity in the trunk section and
   maximum face sensitivity in the posterior terminal ascending branch. The
   audiovisual integration area for emotional signals is located at the
   bifurcation of the STS at an overlap of voice- and face-sensitive
   regions. In summary, our findings evidence a functional subdivision of
   the STS into modules subserving the processing of different aspects of
   social communication, here exemplified in human voices and faces and
   audiovisual integration of emotional signals from these sources and
   suggest a possible interaction of the underlying voice- and
   face-sensitive neuronal populations during the formation of the
   audiovisual emotional percept. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{It is well known that specific components of motor programs are
   automatically activated when they are afforded by object related
   pragmatic features. Among these features the handle appears to be
   particularly salient for interacting with an object. The aim of this
   study was to test the modulation of the motor system when object
   features, particularly relevant for the action, like the object's
   handle, are violated. In order to address this issue a TMS paradigm was
   used in which familiar objects with a whole or broken handle, positioned
   to the right or to the left, were centrally presented. A control
   condition was also included in which a symbol ('\#' character) was shown
   in the right or in the left visual field. Participants had to watch
   stimuli carefully. The left hemisphere hand motor area was magnetically
   stimulated 200 ms after stimulus presentation. Results showed that MEP
   areas were larger when the handle was located to the right side
   consistent with the visuomotor role of this feature, but only when the
   handle was complete. The present data (1) suggest a more active role of
   the dorsal stream in building up object knowledge and (2) allow one to
   rule out the role of any asymmetrical aspect of an object in motor
   coding. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Auditory hallucination is a key characteristic of schizophrenia that
   seriously debilitates the patient, with consequences for social
   engagement with others. Hallucinatory experiences are also observed in
   healthy individuals in the general population who report ``hearing
   voices{''} in the absence of an external acoustic input. A view on
   auditory hallucinations and ``hearing voices{''} is presented that
   regards such phenomena as perceptual processes, originating from speech
   perception areas in the left temporal lobe. Healthy individuals
   ``hearing voices{''} are, however, often aware that the experience comes
   from inner thought processes, which is not reported by hallucinating
   patients. A perceptual model can therefore, not alone explain the
   difference in the phenomenology of how the ``voices heard{''} are
   attributed to either an inner or outer cause. An expanded model is thus
   presented which takes into account top-down cognitive control, localized
   to prefrontal cortical areas, to inhibit and re-attribute the perceptual
   mis-representations. The expanded model is suggested to be empirically
   validated using a dichotic listening speech perception paradigm with
   instructions for top-down control of attention focus to either the right
   or left side in auditory space. It is furthermore suggested to use fMRI
   to validate the temporal and frontal lobe neuronal correlates of the
   cognitive processes involved in auditory hallucinations.}},

Abstract = {{Serotonin is a key neurotransmitter involved in emotional regulation and
   memory. A number of studies using acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) in
   healthy subjects have shown that a temporary serotonin reduction both
   induces a negative emotional bias and impairs long-term memory. However,
   little is known about the specific effects of ATD on emotional memory.
   Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated the
   effect of ATD on negative memory and executive function in healthy
   volunteers. Our emotional oddball task required participants to
   distinguish infrequently presented targets from distracting negative and
   neutral pictures. Memory for the distracting pictures was tested 1 h
   following the fMRI session. ATD selectively enhanced memory for negative
   distractors relative to neutral distractors and increased activation in
   response to the negative distractors in the left orbital-inferior
   frontal, dorsomedial prefrontal and bilateral angular gyri. ATD also
   induced greater activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus and
   anterior cingulate across all stimuli. Stronger frontal activation to
   distractors was positively correlated with memory performance on ATD but
   not control days, indicating a possible compensatory mechanism for
   coping with increased task demand under the ATD challenge. These
   findings highlight the importance of serotonin in negative memory with
   implications for mood disorders.}},

Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Observers were scanned while they watched a video of an actor using an
   object. Three conditions were contrasted in which the same object was
   used: (i) normally (e.g. using a tennis racket to hit a ball), (ii) in
   an unusual way (e.g. using a tennis racket to strain spaghetti), (iii)
   in a pretend play (e.g. playing a tennis racket like a banjo). Observing
   real and unusual uses of objects activated areas previously seen in
   studies of tool use including areas associated with a mirror system for
   action. Observing pretend play activated additional areas previously
   associated with theory of mind tasks and listening to narrative,
   including medial prefrontal cortex, posterior superior temporal sulcus
   and temporal poles. After presentation of each video, observers were
   asked to name the object as used in the preceding action video (e.g.
   racket, sieve or banjo). Naming the pretend object elicited activity in
   medial prefrontal cortex. These results are consistent with proposals
   that pretend play is a form of communicative narrative, associated with
   the ability to mentalize. However, this leaves open the question as to
   whether pretence or mentalizing is the more basic process.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has implicated regions of anterior insula/frontal
   operculum in processing conspecific facial expressions of disgust. It
   has been suggested however that there are a variety of disgust facial
   expression components which relate to the disgust-eliciting stimulus.
   The nose wrinkle is predominantly associated with irritating or
   offensive smells, the mouth gape and tongue extrusion with distaste and
   oral irritation, while a broader range of disgust elicitors including
   aversive interpersonal contacts and certain moral offenses are
   associated primarily with the upper lip curl. Using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging, we show that activity in the anterior insula/frontal
   operculum is seen only in response to canonical disgust faces,
   exhibiting the nose wrinkle and upper lip curl, and not in response to
   distaste facial expressions, exhibiting a mouth gape and tongue
   protrusion. Canonical disgust expressions also result in activity in
   brain regions linked to social cognition more broadly, including dorsal
   medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, temporo-parietal
   junction and superior temporal sulcus. We interpret these differences in
   relation to the relative functional and communicative roles of the
   different disgust expressions and suggest a significant role for
   appraisal processes in the insula activation to facial expressions of
   disgust.}},

Abstract = {{Our knowledge on the development of the affective and cognitive
   circuitries that underlie affect regulation is still limited. This
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study examined whether
   there is more efficient prefrontal modulation of affective circuits with
   development. Ten adolescents (mean age 14 +/- 2 years) and 10 adults
   (mean age 30 +/- 6 years) underwent two scanning conditions that
   required different levels of cognitive control over face emotion
   processing. A `directed' emotion processing condition required judgment
   of facial expressions. An `incidental' emotion processing condition
   required an age judgment. For the incidental emotion processing
   condition, adolescents, compared with adults, showed less activation in
   right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and greater activation in
   paralimbic regions, suggesting greater emotional reactivity and immature
   prefrontal circuitries for affect regulation. For the directed emotion
   processing condition, adolescents, compared with adults, showed
   decreased recruitment of both the dorsal and pregenual right anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC), suggesting immature modulatory functions of the
   ACC during directed face emotion processing. These results indicate that
   the neural circuitries for affect regulation are still developing in
   adolescence and have not yet reached the adult level.}},

Abstract = {{A reward or punishment can seem better or worse depending on what else
   might have happened. Little is known, however, about how neural
   representations of an anticipated incentive might be influenced by the
   available alternatives. We used event-related FMRI to investigate the
   activation in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), while we varied the
   available alternative incentives in a monetary incentive delay task.
   Some task blocks included only uncertain gains and losses; others
   included the same uncertain gains and losses intermixed with certain
   gains and losses. The availability of certain gains and losses increased
   NAcc activation for uncertain losses and decreased the difference
   between uncertain gains and losses. We suggest that this pattern of
   activation can result from reference point changes across blocks, and
   that the worst available loss may serve as an important anchor for NAcc
   activation. These findings imply that NAcc activation represents
   anticipated incentive value relative to the current context of available
   alternative gains and losses.}},

Abstract = {{An incredible amount of data is generated in the course of a functional
   neuroimaging experiment. The quantity of data gives us improved temporal
   and spatial resolution with which to evaluate our results. It also
   creates a staggering multiple testing problem. A number of methods have
   been created that address the multiple testing problem in neuroimaging
   in a principled fashion. These methods place limits on either the
   familywise error rate (FWER) or the false discovery rate (FDR) of the
   results. These principled approaches are well established in the
   literature and are known to properly limit the amount of false positives
   across the whole brain. However, a minority of papers are still
   published every month using methods that are improperly corrected for
   the number of tests conducted. These latter methods place limits on the
   voxelwise probability of a false positive and yield no information on
   the global rate of false positives in the results. In this commentary,
   we argue in favor of a principled approach to the multiple testing
   problem-one that places appropriate limits on the rate of false
   positives across the whole brain gives readers the information they need

Abstract = {{Statistical thresholding (i.e. P-values) in fMRI research has become
   increasingly conservative over the past decade in an attempt to diminish
   Type I errors (i.e. false alarms) to a level traditionally allowed in
   behavioral science research. In this article, we examine the unintended
   negative consequences of this single-minded devotion to Type I errors:
   increased Type II errors (i.e. missing true effects), a bias toward
   studying large rather than small effects, a bias toward observing
   sensory and motor processes rather than complex cognitive and affective
   processes and deficient meta-analyses. Power analyses indicate that the
   reductions in acceptable P-values over time are producing dramatic
   increases in the Type II error rate. Moreover, the push for a mapwide
   false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 is based on the assumption that this
   is the FDR in most behavioral research; however, this is an inaccurate
   assessment of the conventions in actual behavioral research. We report
   simulations demonstrating that combined intensity and cluster size
   thresholds such as P < 0.005 with a 10 voxel extent produce a desirable
   balance between Types I and II error rates. This joint threshold
   produces high but acceptable Type II error rates and produces a FDR that
   is comparable to the effective FDR in typical behavioral science
   articles (while a 20 voxel extent threshold produces an actual FDR of
   0.05 with relatively common imaging parameters). We recommend a greater
   focus on replication and meta-analysis rather than emphasizing single
   studies as the unit of analysis for establishing scientific truth. From
   this perspective, Type I errors are self-erasing because they will not
   replicate, thus allowing for more lenient thresholding to avoid Type II
   errors.}},

Title = {{Modulation of Motor Area Activity by the Outcome for a Player during
   Observation of a Baseball Game}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: Observing competitive games such as sports is a pervasive
   entertainment among humans. The inclination to watch others play may be
   based on our social-cognitive ability to understand the internal states
   of others. The mirror neuron system, which is activated when a subject
   observes the actions of others, as well as when they perform the same
   action themselves, seems to play a crucial role in this process. Our
   previous study showed that activity of the mirror neuron system was
   modulated by the outcome of the subject's favored player during
   observation of a simple competitive game (rock-paper-scissors). However,
   whether the mirror neuron system responds similarly in a more complex
   and naturalistic sports game has not yet been fully investigated.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: In the present study, we measured the
   activity of motor areas when the subjects, who were amateur baseball
   field players (non-pitchers), watched short movie clips of scenes in
   professional baseball games. The subjects were instructed to support
   either a batter or a pitcher when observing the movie clip. The results
   showed that activity in the motor area exhibited a strong interaction
   between the subject's supported side (batter or pitcher) and the outcome
   (a hit or an out). When the subject supported the batter, motor area
   activity was significantly higher when the batter made an out than when
   he made a hit. However, such modulation was not apparent when the
   subject supported the pitcher.
   Conclusions/Significance: This result indicates that mirror neuron
   system activity is modulated by the outcome for a particular player in a
   competitive game even when observing a complex and naturalistic sports
   game. We suggest that our inclination to watch competitive games is
   facilitated by this characteristic of the mirror neuron system.}},

Abstract = {{Oxytocinergic neurotransmission during lactation contributes to
   reduction of anxiety levels and fear. However, our knowledge of where
   oxytocin acts in the brain to achieve this effect, particularly to an
   unconditioned fear stimulus, is incomplete. We used blood oxygenation
   level dependent (BOLD) fMRI to test whether central administration of
   oxytocin 45-60 min before fMRI scanning alters maternal brain activation
   in response to a predator scent (TMT, trimethylthiazoline). Comparison
   behavioral experiments that examined maternal responses to this
   unconditioned fear-inducing odor were carried out in a separate cohort
   of lactating rats given similar treatments. Behavioral experiments
   confirmed the effectiveness of oxytocin at reducing freezing behavior as
   compared to vehicle controls. Our fMRI findings indicate that oxytocin
   modulated both positive and negative BOLD responses across several
   olfactory and forebrain nuclei. Significantly greater percent increases
   in BOLD signal in response to TMT were observed in the anterior
   cingulate, bed nucleus of stria terminalis and perirhinal area of
   oxytocin pretreated rats. These animals also showed significantly larger
   percent decreases in BOLD in mammillary bodies, secondary motor cortex,
   gustatory cortex, prelimbic prefrontal cortex, orbital cortex, and the
   anterior olfactory nucleus. The observed pattern of brain activity
   suggests that oxytocin enhances neural processing in emotion and
   cognition driven brain areas such as the cingulate cortex, while
   dramatically reducing activity in areas also controlling autonomic,
   visceromotor and skeletomotor responses. The present data contribute to
   the growing literature suggesting the oxytocin modulate the integration
   of emotional and cognitive information through myriad brain regions to
   facilitate decreases in anxiety (even to an unconditioned stimulus)
   while potentially promoting pair-bonding, social memory and parental
   care. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Volume = {{465}},

Abstract = {{Evaluative-feedback, occurring in our daily life, generally contains
   subjective appraisal of one's specific abilities and personality
   characteristics besides objective right-or-wrong information.
   Traditional psychological researches have proved it to be important in
   building up one's self-concept; however, the neural basis underlying its
   cognitive processing remains unclear. The present neuroimaging study
   revealed the mechanism of evaluative-feedback processing at the neural
   level. 19 healthy Chinese subjects participated in this experiment, and
   completed the time-estimation task to better their performance according
   to four types of feedback, namely positive evaluative- and
   performance-feedback as well as negative evaluative- and
   performance-feedback. Neuroimaging findings showed that evaluative-
   rather than performance-feedback can induce increased activities mainly
   distributed in the cortical midline structures (CMS), including medial
   prefrontal cortex (BA 8/9)/anterior cigulate cortex (ACC, BA 20),
   precuneus (BA 7/31) adjacent to posterior cingulate gyrus (PCC, BA 23)
   of both hemispheres, as well as right inferior lobule (BA 40). This
   phenomenon can provide evidence that evaluative-feedback may
   significantly elicit the self-related processing in our brain. In
   addition, our results also revealed that more brain areas, particularly
   some self-related neural substrates were activated by the positive
   evaluative-feedback, in comparative with the negative one. In sum, this
   study suggested that evaluative-feedback was closely correlated with the
   self-concept processing, which distinguished it from the
   performance-feedback. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Recognition of actions and complex movements is fundamental for social
   interactions and action understanding. While the relationship between
   motor expertise and visual recognition of body movements has received a
   vast amount of interest, the role of visual learning remains largely
   unexplored. Combining psychophysics and functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) experiments, we investigated neural correlates of visual
   learning of complex movements. Subjects were trained to visually
   discriminate between very similar complex movement stimuli generated by
   motion morphing that were either compatible (experiments 1 and 2) or
   incompatible (experiment 3) with human movement execution. Employing an
   fMRI adaptation paradigm as index of discriminability, we scanned human
   subjects before and after discrimination training. The results of
   experiment 1 revealed three different effects as a consequence of
   training: (1) Emerging fMRI-selective adaptation in general
   motion-related areas (hMT/V5+, KO/V3b) for the differences between
   human-like movements. (2) Enhanced of fMRI-selective adaptation already
   present before training in biological motion-related areas (pSTS, FBA).
   (3) Changes covarying with task difficulty in frontal areas. Moreover,
   the observed activity changes were specific to the trained movement
   patterns (experiment 2). The results of experiment 3, testing artificial
   movement stimuli, were strikingly similar to the results obtained for
   human movements. General and biological motion-related areas showed
   movement-specific changes in fMRI-selective adaptation for the
   differences between the stimuli after training. These results support
   the existence of a powerful visual machinery for the learning of complex
   motion patterns that is independent of motor execution. We thus propose
   a key role of visual learning in action recognition.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Prior studies suggest that the amygdala shapes complex
   behavioral responses to socially ambiguous cues. We explored human
   amygdala function during explicit behavioral decision making about
   discrete emotional facial expressions that can represent socially
   unambiguous and ambiguous cues.
   Methods: During functional magnetic resonance imaging, 43 healthy adults
   were required to make complex social decisions (i.e., approach or avoid)
   about either relatively unambiguous (i.e., angry, fearful, happy) or
   ambiguous (i.e., neutral) facial expressions. Amygdala activation during
   this task was compared with that elicited by simple, perceptual
   decisions (sex discrimination) about the identical facial stimuli.
   Results: Angry and fearful expressions were more frequently judged as
   avoidable and happy expressions most often as approachable. Neutral
   expressions were equally judged as avoidable and approachable. Reaction
   times to neutral expressions were longer than those to angry, fearful,
   and happy expressions during social judgment only. Imaging data on
   stimuli judged to be avoided revealed a significant task by emotion
   interaction in the amygdala. Here, only neutral facial expressions
   elicited greater activity during social judgment than during sex
   discrimination. Furthermore, during social judgment only, neutral faces
   judged to be avoided were associated with greater amygdala activity
   relative to neutral faces that were judged as approachable. Moreover,
   functional coupling between the amygdala and both dorsolateral
   prefrontal (social judgment > sex discrimination) and cingulate (sex
   discrimination > social judgment) cortices was differentially modulated
   by task during processing of neutral faces.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that increased amygdala reactivity and
   differential functional coupling with prefrontal circuitries may shape
   complex decisions and behavioral responses to socially ambiguous cues.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Emotional instability is a defining feature of borderline
   personality disorder (BPD); yet, little is understood about its
   underlying neural correlates. One possible contributing factor to
   emotional instability is a failure to adequately employ adaptive
   cognitive regulatory strategies such as psychological distancing.
   Methods: To determine whether there are differences in neural dynamics
   underlying this control strategy between BPD patients and healthy
   control (HC) subjects, blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)
   functional magnetic resonance imaging signals were acquired as 18 BPD
   and 16 HC subjects distanced from or simply looked at pictures depicting
   social interactions. Contrasts in signal between distance and look
   conditions were compared between groups.
   Results: Borderline personality disorder patients showed a different
   pattern of activation compared with HC subjects when looking at negative
   versus neutral pictures. When distancing versus looking at negative
   pictures, both groups showed decreased negative affect ratings and
   increased activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, areas
   near/along the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), ventrolateral prefrontal
   cortex, and posterior cingulate/precuneus regions. However, the BPD
   group showed less BOLD signal change in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex
   and IPS, less deactivation in the amygdala, and greater activation in
   the superior temporal sulcus and superior frontal gyrus.
   Conclusions: Borderline personality disorder and HC subjects display
   different neural dynamics while passively viewing social emotional
   stimuli. In addition, BPD patients do not engage the cognitive control
   regions to the extent that HCs do when employing a distancing strategy
   to regulate emotional reactions, which may be a factor contributing to
   the affective instability of BPD.}},

Abstract = {{The observation of other people's actions plays an important role in
   shaping the perceptual, cognitive, and motor processes of the observer.
   It has been suggested that these social influences occur because the
   observation of action evokes a representation of that response in the
   observer and that these codes are subsequently accessed by other
   cognitive systems to modify future behaviour. In the case of social
   search and movement tasks, the observation-evoked response code is
   thought to activate the same mechanisms that are activated following
   internally-generated response codes. In support of this hypothesis, the
   present study revealed that the magnitudes of the between-person
   inhibition of return (IOR) effects were correlated with within-person
   IOR effects. These findings provide substantial support for the link
   between observation-evoked response codes and social cognitive effects.

Abstract = {{This study examined the neural basis of auditory selective attention
   using functional magnetic resonance imaging. The main hypothesis stated
   that attending to a particular sound frequency would significantly
   enhance the neural response within those tonotopic regions of the
   auditory cortex sensitive to that frequency. To test this prediction,
   low- and high-frequency sound sequences were interleaved to produce two
   concurrent auditory streams. Six normally hearing participants either
   performed a task which required them to attend to one or the other
   stream or listened passively to the sounds while functional images were
   acquired using a high-resolution (1.5 mm x 1.5 mm x 2.5 mm) sequence.
   Two statistical comparisons identified the attention-specific and
   general effects of enhancement. The first controlled for task-related
   processes, while the second did not. Results demonstrated
   frequency-specific, attention-specific enhancement in the response to
   the attended frequency, but no response suppression for the unattended
   frequency. Instead, a general effect of suppression was found in several
   posterior sites, possibly related to resting-state processes.
   Furthermore, there was widespread general enhancement across auditory
   cortex when performing the task compared to passive listening. This
   enhancement did include frequency-sensitive regions, but was not
   restricted to them. In conclusion, our results show partial support for
   frequency-specific enhancement. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{According to recent models of individual differences in attachment
   organization, a basic dimension of adult attachment is avoidance.
   Attachment-related avoidance corresponds to tendencies to withdraw from
   close relationships and to all unwillingness to rely on others. In the
   formation of attachment orientation during infancy facial emotional
   interaction plays a central role. There exists an inborn very rapid
   decoding capacity for facial emotional expression. In this study,
   functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine differences in
   automatic brain reactivity to facial emotions as a function of
   attachment avoidance in a sample of 51 healthy adults. Pictures of sad
   and happy faces (which are approach-related interpersonal signals) were
   presented masked by neutral faces. The Relationship Scales Questionnaire
   (RSQ) was used to assess the attachment avoidance. Masked sad faces
   activated the amygdala, the insula, occipito-temporal areas, and the
   somatosensory cortices. Independently from trait anxiety, depressivity,
   and detection performance, attachment avoidance was found to be
   inversely related to responses of the primary somatosensory cortex (BA
   3) to masked sad faces. A low spontaneous responsivity of the primary
   somatosensory cortex to negative faces Could be a correlate of the
   habitual unwillingness to deal with partners' distress and needs for
   proximity. The somatosensory cortices are known to be critically
   involved in the processes of emotional mimicry and simulation which have
   the potential to increase social affiliation. Our data are consistent
   with the idea that people who withdraw from close relationships respond
   spontaneously to a lesser extent to negative interpersonal emotional
   signals than securely attached individuals. Hum Brain Mapp 30:3553-3562,

Abstract = {{Action observation leads to the automatic activation of the
   corresponding motor representation in the observer through
   ``mirror-matching.{''} This constitutes a ``shared representational
   system,{''} which is thought to subserve social understanding by motor
   simulation. However, it is unclear how these shared representations can
   be controlled and distinguished. Brain imaging Suggests that controlling
   shared representations, indexed by the ability to control automatic
   imitative responses, activates anterior fronto-median cortex (aFMC), and
   temporo-parietal junction (TPJ). Crucially, these regions are also
   consistently implicated in mental state attribution and have provided an
   alternative account for higher-level social cognition. Here, we directly
   tested whether social-cognitive processes involve similar key
   computational mechanisms as the control of shared representations by
   using functional brain imaging to reveal overlapping brain circuits. We
   show in a within-subject design that commonly activated regions occurred
   selectively in aFMC and TPJ. Mentalizing and self-referential thoughts
   recruited a region in aFMC, which was also activated when controlling
   imitation. In the TPJ, an area overlapped between mentalizing, agency
   processing, and imitative control. Behavioral and neural correlates of
   mentalizing were further related to the individual ability for
   controlling imitation. Our findings support the assumption of shared key
   processes and suggest a novel link between embodied and social
   cognition. Hum Brain Mapp 30:3704-3718, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Psoriasis produces significant psychosocial disability; however, little
   is understood about the neurocognitive mechanisms that mediate the
   adverse consequences of the social stigma associated with visible skin
   lesions, such as disgusted facial expressions of others. Both the
   feeling of disgust and the observation of disgust in others are known to
   activate the insula cortex. We investigated whether the social impact of
   psoriasis is associated with altered cognitive processing of disgust
   using (i) a covert recognition of faces task conducted using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and (ii) the facial expression
   recognition task (FERT), a decision-making task, conducted outside the
   scanner to assess the ability to recognize overtly different intensities
   of disgust. Thirteen right-handed male patients with psoriasis and 13
   age-matched male controls were included. In the fMRI study, psoriasis
   patients had significantly (P<0.005) smaller signal responses to
   disgusted faces in the bilateral insular cortex compared with healthy
   controls. These data were corroborated by FERT, in that patients were
   less able than controls to identify all intensities of disgust tested.
   We hypothesize that patients with psoriasis, in this case male patients,
   develop a coping mechanism to protect them from stressful emotional
   responses by blocking the processing of disgusted facial expressions.}},

Abstract = {{Relatively little is known about the neural bases of the Big Five
   personality trait Openness/Intellect. This trait is composed of 2
   related but separable aspects, Openness to Experience and Intellect. On
   the basis of previous behavioral research (C. G. DeYoung, J. B.
   Peterson, \& D. M. Higgins, 2005), the authors hypothesized that brain
   activity supporting working memory (WM) would be related to Intellect
   but not to Openness. To test this hypothesis, the authors used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to scan a sample of 104
   healthy adults as they performed a difficult WM task. Intellect (and not
   Openness) was found to correlate with WM accuracy and with
   accuracy-related brain activity, in left lateral anterior prefrontal
   cortex and posterior medial frontal cortex. Neural activity in these
   regions mediated the association between Intellect and WM performance,
   implicating these regions in the neural substrate of Intellect.
   Intellect was also correlated significantly with scores on tests of
   intelligence and WM capacity, but the association of Intellect with
   brain activity could not be entirely explained by cognitive ability.}},

   voices, using 120 emotion items. Older adults were worse than young
   adults in 17 of 30 comparisons, with consistent difficulties in
   recognizing both positive (happy) and negative (angry and sad) vocal and
   bodily expressions. Nearly three quarters of older adults functioned at
   a level similar to the lowest one fourth of young adults, suggesting
   that age-related changes are common. In addition, we found that older
   adults' difficulty in matching emotions was not explained by difficulty
   on the component sources (i.e., faces or voices on their own),

Abstract = {{The sex disparity in the development of depression has long been an
   important research topic, but the sex-related differences in neural
   activity during emotion regulation have been less thoroughly studied. It
   was hypothesized that, during the regulation of emotion, there would be
   more activation in the prefrontal regions implicated in cognitive
   processing for males, while there would be more activation in the
   prefrontal regions implicated in affective processing for females. This
   fMRI study recruited 12 females and 12 males who were required to view
   or to regulate the negative and positive emotion induced by some
   emotion-arousing pictures. During the regulation of negative emotion,
   both males and females had stronger activation in the left anterior
   cingulate gyrus, but males showed more activation in the prefrontal
   regions in general, including the left dorsolateral and lateral
   orbitofrontal gyrus as well as the right anterior cingulate gyrus, while
   females only showed stronger activation in the left medial orbitofrontal
   gyrus. For the regulation of positive emotion, both males and females
   showed stronger activation in the left dorsomedial prefrontal gyrus, but
   males were found to also have stronger activity in the left lateral
   orbitofrontal gyrus. It was concluded that there are common as well as
   sex-specific sets of brain regions involved in regulating negative and
   positive emotion, and the findings may have significant implications for
   females' vulnerability to developing depression. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A classic debate in the organizational justice literature concerns the
   question of whether procedural justice and distributive justice are
   independent constructs. We investigate this question by using fMRI
   methods to examine brain activation patterns associated with procedural
   and distributive unfairness. We observed a clear dissociation of
   activation between these two forms of justice, and only a minimal amount
   of shared activation in the hypothesized regions. Specifically, unfair
   procedures evoked greater activation in parts of the brain related to
   social cognition, such as the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC)
   and the superior temporal sulcus (STS), whereas unfair outcomes evoked
   greater activation in more emotional areas of the brain, such as the
   anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), anterior insula (AI) and the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). We interpret the findings as
   supporting the notion that the two forms of justice reflect distinct
   constructs, while recognizing that, as forms of justice, they are
   closely related nomologically. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The present investigation explores the neural mechanisms underlying the

   valued or not - by exposing participants to the preferences of their
   peers - and assessed subsequent brain activity during an incidental
   processing task in which participants viewed popular, unpopular, and
   novel symbols. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) differentiated
   between symbols that were and were not socially tagged - a possible
   index of normative influence while aspects of the striatum (the caudate)
   differentiated between popular and unpopular symbols - a possible index
   of informational influence. These results suggest that integrating
   activity in these two brain regions may differentiate objects that have
   become valued as a result of social influence from those valued for
   non-social reasons. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Action-based decision making involves choices between different physical

   Using fMRI in human subjects, we found evidence for action-value signals
   in supplementary motor cortex. Separate brain regions, most prominently
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex, were involved in encoding the expected
   value of the action that was ultimately taken. These findings
   differentiate two main forms of value signals in the human brain: those
   relating to the value of each available action, likely reflecting
   signals that are a precursor of choice, and those corresponding to the
   expected value of the action that is subsequently chosen, and therefore
   reflecting the consequence of the decision process. Furthermore, we also
   found signals in the dorsomedial frontal cortex that resemble the output
   of a decision comparator, which implicates this region in the

   mental arithmetic with negative social evaluative feedback. Due to the
   block design nature of the MIST, it has not been possible thus far to
   investigate which brain areas respond specifically to the key components
   of the MIST (mental arithmetic, failure, negative social evaluation). in
   the current study, we developed an event-related MIST (eventMIST) in
   order to investigate which neural activation patterns are associated
   with performing mental arithmetic vs. processing of social evaluative
   threat. Data was available from twenty healthy university students. The
   eventMIST induced a significant stress response in a subsample of
   subjects, called the responders (n=7). Direct comparison between brain
   activity changes in responders vs. non-responders, in response to
   challenging math, revealed increased activity bilaterally in dorsomedial
   prefrontal cortex (PFC), left temporal pole, and right dorsolateral PFC.
   In response to negative social evaluation, responders showed reduction
   of brain activity in limbic system regions (medial orbitofrontal cortex
   and hippocampus), which was largely lacking in non-responders. Direct
   comparison between the groups for this contrast did not reveal any
   significant difference, probably due to small number of events
   available. This is the first study to use an event-related paradigm to
   investigate brain activity patterns in relation to challenging math and
   social evaluative threat separately. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Whenever we observe a movement of a conspecific, our mirror neuron
   system becomes activated, urging us to imitate the observed movement.
   However, because such automatic imitation is not always appropriate, an
   inhibitive component keeping us from imitating everything we see seems
   crucial for an effective social behavior. This becomes evident from
   neuropsychological conditions like echopraxia, in which this suppression
   is absent. Here, we unraveled the neurodynamics underlying this proposed
   inhibition of automatic imitation by measuring and manipulating brain
   activity during the execution of a stimulus-response compatibility
   paradigm. Within the identified connectivity network, right
   middle/inferior frontal cortex sends neural input concerning general
   response inhibition to right premotor cortex, which is involved in
   automatic imitation. Subsequently, the fully prepared imitative response
   is sent to left opercular cortex that functions as a final gating
   mechanism for intentional imitation. We propose an informed
   neurocognitive model of inhibition of automatic imitation, suggesting a
   functional dissociation between automatic and intentional imitation.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Exposure-based therapy for anxiety disorders is believed to
   operate on the basis of fear extinction. Studies have shown acute
   administration of D-cycloserine (DCS) enhances fear extinction in
   animals and facilitates exposure therapy in humans, but the neural
   mechanisms are not completely understood. To date, no study has examined
   neural effects of acute DCS in anxiety-disordered populations.
   Methods: Two hours prior to functional magnetic resonance imaging
   scanning, 23 spider-phobic and 23 non-phobic participants were
   randomized to receive DCS 100 mg or placebo, During scanning,
   participants viewed spider, butterfly, and Gaussian-blurred baseline
   images in a block-design paradigm. Diagnostic and treatment groups were
   compared regarding differential activations to spider versus butterfly
   stimuli.
   Results: In the phobic group, DCS enhanced prefrontal (PFC), dorsal
   anterior cingulate (ACC), and insula activations. For controls, DCS
   enhanced ventral ACC and caudate activations. There was a positive
   correlation between lateral PFC and amygdala activation for the
   placebo-phobic group. Reported distress during symptom provocation was
   correlated with amygdala activation in the placebo-phobic group and
   orbitofrontal cortex activation in the DCS-phobic group.
   Conclusions: Results suggest that during initial phobic symptom
   provocation DCS enhances activation in regions involved in cognitive
   control and interoceptive integration, including the PFC, ACC, and
   insular cortices for phobic participants, CNS Spectr.

Abstract = {{The human amygdala plays a pivotal role in the processing of socially
   significant information. Anatomical studies show that the human amygdala
   is not a single homogeneous structure but is composed of segregable
   subregions. These have recently been functionally delineated by using a
   combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging (WRI) and
   cytoarchitectonically defined probabilistic maps. However, the response
   characteristics and individual contribution of these subregions to the
   processing of social-emotional stimuli are little understood. Here, we
   used this novel technique to segregate intra-amygdalar responses to
   facial expressions and nonsocial control stimuli. We localized facial
   expression-evoked signal changes bilaterally in the superficial
   amygdala, which suggests that this subregion selectively extracts the
   social value of incoming sensory information. Hum Brain Mapp

Abstract = {{In mammals, the neuropeptide vasopressin is a key molecule for complex
   emotional and social behaviours. Two microsatellite polymorphisms, RS1
   and RS3, near the promoter of AVPR1A, encoding the receptor subtype most
   heavily implicated in behaviour regulation, have been linked to autism
   and behavioural traits. However, the impact of these variants on human
   brain function is unknown. Here we show that human amygdala function is
   strongly associated with genetic variation in AVPR1A. Using an imaging
   genetics approach in a sample of 121 volunteers studied with an
   emotional face-matching paradigm, we found that differential activation
   of amygdala is observed in carriers of risk alleles for RS3 and RS1.
   Alleles in RS1 previously reported to be significantly over- and
   undertransmitted to autistic probands showed opposing effects on
   amygdala activation. Furthermore, we show functional difference in human
   brain between short and long repeat lengths that mirror findings
   recently obtained in a corresponding variant in voles. Our results
   indicate a neural mechanism mediating genetic risk for autism through an
   impact on amygdala signalling and provide a rationale for exploring
   therapeutic strategies aimed at abnormal amygdala function in this
   disorder. Molecular Psychiatry (2009) 14, 968-975;

Abstract = {{Functional integration in the brain rests on anatomical connectivity
   (the presence of axonal connections) and effective connectivity (the
   causal influences mediated by these connections). The deployment of
   anatomical connections provides important constraints on effective
   connectivity, but does not fully determine it, because synaptic
   connections can be expressed functionally in a dynamic and
   context-dependent fashion. Although it is generally assumed that
   anatomical connectivity data is important to guide the construction of
   neurobiologically realistic models of effective connectivity; the degree
   to which these models actually profit from anatomical constraints has
   not yet been formally investigated. Here, we use diffusion weighted
   imaging and probabilistic tractography to specify anatomically informed
   priors for dynamic causal models (DCMs) of fMRI data. We constructed 64
   alternative DCMs, which embodied different mappings between the
   probability of an anatomical connection and the prior variance of the
   corresponding of effective connectivity, and fitted them to empirical
   fMRI data from 12 healthy subjects. Using Bayesian model selection, we
   show that the best model is one in which anatomical probability
   increases the prior variance of effective connectivity parameters in a
   nonlinear and monotonic (sigmoidal) fashion. This means that the higher
   the likelihood that a given connection exists anatomically, the larger
   one should set the prior variance of the corresponding coupling
   parameter; hence making it easier for the parameter to deviate from zero
   and represent a strong effective connection. To our knowledge, this
   study provides the first formal evidence that probabilistic knowledge of
   anatomical connectivity can improve models of functional integration.

Title = {{The temporal dynamics of insula activity to disgust and happy facial

Abstract = {{The insula has consistently been shown to be involved in processing
   stimuli that evoke the emotional response of disgust. Recently, its
   specificity for processing disgust has been challenged and a broader
   role of the insula in the representation of interoceptive information
   has been suggested. Studying the temporal dynamics of insula activation
   during emotional processing can contribute valuable information
   pertaining to this issue. Few studies have addressed the insula's
   putative specificity to disgust and the dynamics of its underlying
   neural processes. In the present study, neuromagnetic responses of 13
   subjects performing an emotional continuous performance task (CPT) to
   faces with disgust, happy, and neutral expressions were obtained.
   Magnetic field tomography extracted the time course of bilateral insula
   activities. Right insula activation was stronger to disgust and happy
   than neutral facial expressions at about 200 ms after stimulus onset.
   Later only at about 350 ms after stimulus onset the right insula was
   activated stronger to disgust than happy facial expressions. Thus, the
   early right insula response reflects activation to emotionally arousing
   stimuli regardless of valence, and the later right insula response
   differentiates disgust from happy facial expressions. Behavioral
   performance but not the insula activity differed between 100 ms and 1000
   ms presentation conditions. Present findings support the notion that the
   insula is involved in the representation of interoceptive information.

Pages = {{1950-1959}},

Abstract = {{Amidst a barrage of sensory information in the environment, the impact
   that individual stimuli have on our behaviour is thought to depend on
   the outcome of competition that occurs within and between multiple brain
   regions. Although biased competition models of attention have been
   tested in visual cortices and to a lesser extent in auditory cortex,
   little is known about the nature of stimulus competition outside of
   sensory areas. Given the hypothesized role of multiple pathways
   (cortical and subcortical) and specialized brain regions for processing
   valence information, studies involving conflicting basic emotional
   stimuli provide a unique opportunity to examine whether the principles
   of biased competition apply outside of sensory cortex. We used fMRI to
   examine the neural representation and resolution of emotional conflict
   in a sample of healthy individuals. Participants made explicit judgments
   about the valence of happy or fearful target facial expressions in the
   context of emotionally congruent, neutral, or incongruent distracters.
   The results suggest that emotional conflict is reflected in a
   dissociable manner across distinct neural regions. Posterior areas of
   visual cortex showed enhanced responding to congruent relative to
   neutral or incongruent stimuli. Orbitofrontal cortex remained sensitive
   to positive affect in the context of conflicting emotional stimuli. In
   contrast, within the amygdala, activity associated with identifying
   positive target expressions declined with the introduction of neutral
   and incongruent expressions; however, activity associated with fearful
   target expressions was less susceptible to the influence of emotional
   context. Enhanced functional connectivity was observed between medial
   prefrontal cortex and the amygdala during incongruent trials; the degree
   of connectivity was correlated with reaction time costs incurred during
   incongruent trials. The results are interpreted with reference to
   current models of emotional attention and regulation. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{2046-2056}},

Abstract = {{Moving a set dinner table often takes two people, and doing so without
   spilling the glasses requires the close coordination of the two agents'
   actions. It has been argued that the mirror neuron system may be the key
   neural locus of such coordination. Instead, here we show that such
   coordination recruits two separable sets of areas: one that could
   translate between motor and visual codes and one that could integrate
   these information to achieve common goals. The former includes regions
   of the putative mirror neuron system, the latter, regions of the
   prefrontal, posterior parietal and temporal lobe adjacent to the
   putative mirror neuron system. Both networks were more active while
   participants cooperated with a human agent, responding to their actions,
   compared to a computer that did not, evidencing their social dimension.
   This finding shows that although the putative mirror neuron system can
   play a critical role in joint actions by translating both agents'
   actions into a common code, the flexible remapping of our own actions
   with those of others required during joint actions seems to be performed
   outside of the putative mirror neuron system. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: Patients affected by schizophrenia show deficits in social
   cognition, with abnormal performance on tasks targeting theory of mind
   (ToM) and empathy (Emp). Brain imaging studies suggested that ToM and
   Emp depend on the activation of brain networks mainly localized at the
   superior temporal lobe and temporo-parietal junction.
   Methods: Participants included 24 schizophrenia patients and 20 control
   subjects. We used brain blood oxygen level dependent fMRI to study the
   neural responses to tasks targeting ToM and Emp. We then studied
   voxel-based morphometry of grey matter in areas where diagnosis
   influenced functional activation to both tasks. Outcomes were analyzed
   in the context of the general linear model, with global grey matter
   volume as nuisance covariate for structural MRI.
   Results: Patients showed worse performance on both tasks. We found
   significant effects of diagnosis on neural responses to the tasks in a
   wide cluster in right posterior superior temporal lobe (encompassing BA
   22-42), in smaller clusters in left temporo-parietal junction and
   temporal pole (13A 38 and 39), and in a white matter region adjacent to
   medial prefrontal cortex (BA 10). A pattern of double dissociation of
   the effects of diagnosis and task on neural responses emerged. Among
   these areas, grey matter volume was found to be reduced in right
   superior temporal lobe regions of patients.
   Conclusions: Functional and structural abnormalities were observed in
   areas affected by the schizophrenic process early in the illness course,
   and known to be crucial for social cognition, suggesting a biological
   basis for social cognition deficits in schizophrenia. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {{To make economic choices between goods, the brain needs to compute
   representations of their values. A great deal of research has been
   performed to determine the neural correlates of value representations in
   the human brain. However, it is still unknown whether there exists a
   region of the brain that commonly encodes decision values for different
   types of goods, or if, in contrast, the values of different types of
   goods are represented in distinct brain regions. We addressed this
   question by scanning subjects with functional magnetic resonance imaging
   while they made real purchasing decisions among different categories of
   goods (food, nonfood consumables, and monetary gambles). We found
   activity in a key brain region previously implicated in encoding
   goal-values: the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was correlated
   with the subjects' value for each category of good. Moreover, we found a
   single area in vmPFC to be correlated with the subjects' valuations for
   all categories of goods. Our results provide evidence that the brain
   encodes a ``common currency{''} that allows for a shared valuation for
   different categories of goods.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with schizophrenia show altered patterns of functional
   activation during working memory processing; specifically,
   high-performing patients appear to hyper-activate and low-performing
   patients appear to hypo-activate when compared with controls. It remains
   unclear how these individual differences in neurophysiological
   activation relate to the clinical presentation of the syndrome. In this
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, the relationship is
   examined using partial least squares (PLS), a multivariate statistical
   technique that selects underlying latent variables based on the
   covariance between two sets of variables, in this case, clinical
   variables and regional fMRI activations during a verbal working memory
   task. The PLS analysis extracted two latent variables, and the
   significance of these associations was confirmed through permutation.
   Lower levels of activation during task performance across frontal and
   parietal regions of interest in the left hemisphere were found to covary
   with poorer role functioning and greater severity of negative and
   disorganized symptoms. while lower activation in right frontal and
   subcortical regions of interest was found to covary with better social
   functioning and fewer positive symptoms. These results suggest that
   appropriately lateralized patterns of functional activation during
   working memory processing are related to the severity of negative and
   disorganized symptoms and to the level of role and social functioning in

Abstract = {{Children with autism exhibit impairment in the processing of
   socioemotional information. The amygdala, a core structure centrally
   involved in socioemotional functioning, has been implicated in the
   neuropathology of autism. We collected structural and functional
   magnetic resonance images (MRI) in children 8 to 12 years of age with
   high-functioning autism (n = 12) and typical development (n = 15). The
   functional MRI experiment involved matching facial expressions and
   people. Volumetric analysis of the amygdala was also performed. The
   results showed that children with autism exhibited intact emotion
   matching, while showing diminished activation of the fusiform gyrus (FG)
   and the amygdala. Conversely, the autism group showed deficits in person
   matching amidst some FG and variable amygdala activation. No significant
   between-group differences in the volume of the left or right amygdala
   were found. There were associations between age, social anxiety and
   amygdala volume in the children with autism such that smaller volumes
   were generally associated with more anxiety and younger age. In summary,
   the data are consistent with abnormalities in circuits involved in
   emotion and face processing reported in studies of older subjects with
   autism showing reductions in amygdala activation related to emotion
   processing and reduced fusiform activation involved in face processing.

Abstract = {{In a study of the effects of normal and pathological aging on
   semantic-related brain activity, 29 patients with Alzheimer's disease
   (AD) and 19 controls subjects (10 young and 9 older controls) performed
   a version of the Pyramids and Palm Trees Test that had been adapted for
   use during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Young and older
   controls activated the left inferior and middle frontal gyri, precuneus;
   and superior parietal lobule. Right frontal and left temporal cortices
   were activated only in the young. The AD group activated only the left
   prefrontal and cingulate cortex. Separate analyses of high- and
   low-performing AD subgroups showed a similar pattern of activation in
   the left frontal lobe, although activiation was more widespread in low
   performers. High performers significantly deactivated anterior midline
   frontal structures, however, while low performers did not. When the
   older adult and AD groups were combined, there was a significant
   positive correlation between left frontal and parietal activation and
   Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (covarying for age),
   suggesting a disease effect. A significant negative correlation between
   activation in the left temporal cortex and age (covarying for MMSE
   score) reflected a possible age effect. These differential effects
   suggest that semantic activation paradigms might aid diagnosis in those
   cases for whom conventional assessments lack the necessary sensitivity
   to detect subtle changes. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Sanctions are used ubiquitously to enforce obedience to social norms.
   However, recent field studies and laboratory experiments have
   demonstrated that cooperation is sometimes reduced when incentives meant
   to promote prosocial decisions are added to the environment. Although
   various explanations for this effect have been suggested, the neural
   foundations of the effect have not been fully explored. Using a modified
   trust game, we found that trustees reciprocate relatively less when
   facing sanction threats, and that the presence of sanctions
   significantly reduces trustee's brain activities involved in social
   reward valuation {[}in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC),
   lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and amygdala] while it simultaneously
   increases brain activities in the parietal cortex, which has been
   implicated in rational decision making. Moreover, we found that neural
   activity in a trustee's VMPFC area predicts her future level of
   cooperation under both sanction and no-sanction conditions, and that
   this predictive activity can be dynamically modulated by the presence of
   a sanction threat.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of positive and negative facial signals to influence
   attention orienting is crucial to social functioning. Given the dramatic
   developmental change in neural architecture supporting social function,
   positive and negative facial cues may influence attention orienting
   differently in relatively young or old individuals. However, virtually
   no research examines such age-related differences in the neural
   circuitry supporting attention orienting to emotional faces. we examined
   age-related correlations in attention-orienting biases to positive and
   negative face emotions in a healthy sample (N=37; 9-40 years old) using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging and a dot-probe task. The
   dot-probe task in an fMRI setting yields both behavioral and neural
   indices of attention biases towards or away from an emotional cue (happy
   or angry face). In the full sample, angry-face attention bias scores did
   not correlate with age, and age did not correlate with brain activation
   to angry faces. However, age did positively correlate with attention
   bias towards happy faces; age also negatively correlated with left
   cuneus and left caudate activation to a happy bias fMRI contrast.
   Secondary analyses suggested age-related changes in attention bias to
   happy faces. The tendency in younger children to direct attention away
   from happy faces (relative to neutral faces) was diminished in the older
   age groups, in tandem with increasing neural deactivation. Implications
   for future work on developmental changes in attention-emotion processing
   are discussed. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   imaging (fMRI) and high-density electroencephalogram (EEG), with a
   repetition suppression design, to assess the spatio-temporal dynamics of
   decoding intentions. Suppression of fMRI activity to the repetition of
   the same intention was observed in inferior frontal lobe, anterior
   intraparietal sulcus (aIPS), and right STS. EEG global field power was
   reduced with repeated intentions at an early (starting at 60 ms) and a
   later (similar to 330 ms) period after the onset of a hand-on-object
   encounter. Source localization during these two intervals involved right
   STS and aIPS regions highly consistent with RS effects observed with
   fMRI. These results reveal the dynamic involvement of temporal and
   parietal networks at multiple stages during the intention decoding and
   without a strict segregation of intention decoding between these
   networks.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic factors are important in the etiology of bipolar disorder (BD).
   However, first-degree relatives of BD patients are at risk for a number
   of psychiatric conditions, most commonly major depressive disorder
   (MDD), although the majority remain well. The purpose of the present
   study was to identify potential brain structural correlates for risk and
   resilience to mood disorders in patients with BD, type I (BD-I) and
   their relatives. Structural magnetic resonance imaging scans were
   acquired from 30 patients with BD-I, 50 of their first-degree relatives
   (28 had no Axis I disorder, while 14 had MDD) and 52 controls. We used
   voxel-based morphometry, implemented in SPM5 to identify group
   differences in regional gray matter volume. From the identified
   clusters, potential differences were further examined based on
   diagnostic status (BD-I patients, MDD relatives, healthy relatives,
   controls). Whole-brain voxel-based analysis identified group differences
   in the left hemisphere in the insula, cerebellum, and substantia nigra.
   Increased left insula volume was associated with genetic preposition to
   BD-I independent of clinical phenotype. In contrast, increased left
   substantia nigra volume was observed in those with the clinical
   phenotype of BD-I. Changes uniquely associated with the absence of a
   clinical diagnosis in BD relatives were observed in the left cerebellum.
   Our data suggest that in BD, genetic and phenotype-related influences on
   brain structure are dissociable; if replicated, these findings may help
   with early identification of high-risk individuals who are more likely
   to transition to syndromal states.}},

Abstract = {{Scientists have for centuries tried to localize and define artistic
   talent. Modern diagnostic techniques that enable visualization and
   measurement of brain morphology and function are positron emission
   tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional
   transcranial Doppler (fTCD) and some biochemical methods. In the
   majority of people, the left hemisphere is dominant, but the right
   hemisphere is considered to be creative, visual, imaginative and
   intuitive. Right hemisphere is associated with musical skills and good
   three-dimensional orientation. It is also associated with good
   coordination and athletic skills. Creative people have less marked
   hemispheric dominance. Using the functional (fMRI) technique, the
   activation Of Visual cortex while watching different kinds of
   compositions was visible; the specific pattern of cortical activation
   was identified for looking at the landscapes, portraits, abstract
   compositions or different combination of colors. For music perception,
   the interplay of activity on both sides of the brain is necessary. In
   the right side, the centers for perceiving pitch, certain aspects of
   melody, harmony, timbre and rhythm are placed, and in the left side the
   processes of rapid changes in frequency and intensity, both in music and
   words are taking place. Adaptation of the brain, i.e. brain plasticity
   can arise upon listening or performing music. It is possible to use
   music, painting and dancing as an aid in the treatment of somatic,
   neurologic or psychiatric disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Despite a widespread familiarity with the often compelling urge to yawn
   after perceiving someone else yawn, an understanding of the neural
   mechanism underlying contagious yawning remains incomplete. In the
   present auditory fMRI study, listeners used a 4-point scale to indicate
   how much they felt like yawning following the presentation of a yawn,
   breath, or scrambled yawn sound. Not only were yawn sounds given
   significantly higher ratings, a trait positively correlated with each
   individual's empathy measure, but relative to control stimuli, random
   effects analyses revealed enhanced hemodynamic activity in the right
   posterior inferior frontal gyrus (pIFG) in response to hearing yawns.
   Moreover, pIFG activity was greatest for yawn stimuli associated with
   high as opposed to low yawn ratings and for control sounds associated
   with equally high yawn ratings. These results support a relationship
   between contagious yawning and empathy and provide evidence for plFG
   involvement in contagious yawning. A supplemental figure for this study

   categories in human extrastriate visual cortex}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{It is well known that adult human extrastriate visual cortex contains
   areas that respond in a selective fashion to specific categories of
   visual stimuli. Three regions have been identified with particular
   regularity: the fusiform face area (FFA), which responds to faces more
   than to other objects; the parahippocampal place area (PPA), which
   responds selectively to images of houses, places, and visual scenes; and
   the extrastriate body area (EBA), which responds specifically to images
   of bodies and body parts. While the presence of these regions in the
   mature human brain is well-established, the degree to which children
   possess these areas and the degree of functional specialization of these
   areas in children of various ages has thus far remained unclear. This
   functional magnetic resonance imaging study examined the development of
   the FFA, EBA, and PPA in healthy, typically developing 7-to 11-year-old
   children and adults. Our results revealed a right FFA and a bilateral
   EBA and PPA in the children that were localized in a way consistent with
   these same regions in adults. In addition, the response profiles of
   these regions were very similar in adults and children with comparable
   levels of functional specificity at all of the ages tested. We discuss
   the implications of this research for understanding abnormal regional
   specialization for social and nonsocial object categories in individuals
   with autism spectrum disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Individualism and collectivism refer to Cultural values that influence
   how people construe themselves and their relation to the world.
   Individualists perceive themselves as stable entities, autonomous from
   other people and their environment, while collectivists view themselves
   as dynamic entities, continually defined by their social context and
   relationships. Despite rich understanding of how, individualism and
   collectivism influence social cognition at a behavioral level, little is
   known about how these cultural values modulate neural representations
   underlying social cognition. Using cross-cultural functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined whether the Cultural values of
   individualism and collectivism modulate neural activity within medial
   prefrontal cortex (MPFC) during processing of general and contextual
   self judgments. Here, we show that neural activity within the anterior
   rostral portion of the MPFC during processing of general and contextual
   self judgments positively predicts how individualistic or collectivistic
   a person is across cultures. These results reveal two kinds of neural
   representations of self (eg, a general self and a contextual self)
   within MPFC and demonstrate how cultural values of individualism and
   collectivism shape these neural representations. Hum Brain Mapp

Abstract = {{One important aspect of self-control is refraining voluntarily from
   already planned behavior, by a final intervention before commitment to
   action. Despite its crucial role in human existence, and clear social
   implications, this aspect of self-control has proved hard to study
   experimentally. One recent study used a perceptual timing paradigm to
   identify specific activations in the dorsal fronto-median cortex (dFMC)
   associated with voluntary inhibition of action (Brass and Haggard
   {[}2007]: J Neurosci 27:9141-9145). Here, we extend this work in two
   important new directions. First, we developed a more naturalistic task
   that gives participants a strong reason to inhibit or to execute
   actions, and therefore involves self-control in the sense Of voluntary
   inhibition of prepotent impulsive responses. Second, we investigated the
   relation between dFMC an other cognitive-motor areas using effective
   connectivity analysis. We show that dFMC is activated when inhibiting
   prepared responses to external events. Moreover, its effective
   connectivity suggests that it allows intentional inhibition of action
   through top-down inhibition of premotor areas. This view of dFMC is
   consistent with a new view of self-control as a key stage in a
   cognitive-motor interface. Hum Brain Mapp 30:2834-2843, 2009, (C) 2008

Abstract = {{Suggestion, a powerful factor in everyday social interaction, is most
   effective during hypnosis. Subjective evaluations and brain-imaging
   findings converge to propose that hypnotic suggestion strongly modulates
   sensory processing. To reveal the brain regions that mediate such a
   modulation, we analyzed data from a
   functional-magnetic-resonance-imaging study on
   hypnotic-suggestion-induced pain on 14 suggestible subjects. Activation
   strengths in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during
   initiation of suggestion for pain correlated positively with the
   subjective intensity of the subsequent suggestion-induced pain, as well
   as with the strengths of the maximum pain-related activation in the in
   the secondary somatosensory (SII) cortex. Furthermore, activation of the
   insula and the anterior cingulate cortex predicted the pain-related SII
   activation. The right DLPFC, as an area important for executive
   functions, likely contributes to functional modulation in the
   modality-specific target areas of given suggestions. Hum Brain Mapp

Abstract = {{In this fMRI study, we investigated the development between adolescence
   and adulthood of the neural processing of social emotions. Unlike basic
   emotions (such as disgust and fear), social emotions (such as guilt and
   embarrassment) require the representation of another's mental states.
   Nineteen adolescents (10-18 years) and 10 adults (22-32 years) were
   scanned while thinking about scenarios featuring either social or basic
   emotions. In both age groups, the anterior rostral medial prefrontal
   cortex (MPFC) was activated during social versus basic emotion. However,
   adolescents activated a lateral part of the MPFC for social versus basic
   emotions, whereas adults did not. Relative to adolescents, adults showed
   higher activity in the left temporal pole for social versus basic
   emotions. These results show that, although the MPFC is activated during
   social emotion in both adults and adolescents, adolescents recruit
   anterior (MPFC) regions more than do adults, and adults recruit
   posterior (temporal) regions more than do adolescents.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the neural correlates of morphological processing in two
   structurally different languages within the same individuals. An
   interesting contrast is provided by Finnish and Swedish where most
   inflected Finnish nouns tend to show a processing cost (i.e., longer
   reaction times and higher error rates) compared to monomorphemic nouns,
   while most inflected Swedish nouns do not show such a cost. This has
   been taken as evidence for morphological decomposition in Finnish and
   full-form recognition of inflected nouns in Swedish. While most previous
   imaging studies had studied the two morphological processing routes
   (decomposition and storage) within the same language and often by
   comparing regular vs. irregular forms, we employed a cross-language
   setting and a direct contrast between morphologically complex vs. simple
   words. We subjected high-proficient Finnish-Swedish early bilinguals to
   a visual lexical decision task with inflected vs. monomorphemic Finnish
   and Swedish nouns while measuring their brain activation by fMRI. The
   participants showed an inflectional processing cost and related left
   fronto-temporal activation increases in Finnish but not in Swedish. This
   suggests a language-specific processing difference in the brain,
   possibly reflecting the structural difference between these two
   languages. In addition, the activations appeared in regions related to
   lexical-semantic and syntactic processing rather than visual word form
   processing. This is in line with previous studies in Finnish, suggesting
   that the morphological processing cost stems primarily from the later,
   semantic-syntactic stage. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although research has demonstrated a relationship between
   proinflammatory cytokine activity and depressive symptoms, the
   neurocognitive processes underlying this relationship have remained
   largely unexplored. Here, we examined the effect of proinflammatory
   cytokine activation on the neural correlates of socially painful
   experience and associated depressed mood. Participants received either
   low-dose endotoxin or placebo through intravenous injection. Levels of
   the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-6. were repeatedly assessed through
   hourly blood draws: self-reported depressed mood was assessed hourly as
   well, Two hours post-injection, participants completed a neuroimaging
   session in which they were socially excluded during an online
   ball-tossing game. Replicating previous research, individuals exposed to
   endotoxin, compared to placebo, showed increases in IL-6 levels and
   depressed mood. Although there were no meaningful differences between
   the endotoxin and control groups in neural responses to social
   exclusion, there were sex differences in the relationships between IL-6
   increases and neural responses to exclusion among subjects exposed to
   endotoxin. Among females, but not males, exposed to endotoxin, increases
   in IL-6 were associated with increases in social pain-related neural
   activity (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula) that
   mediated the relationship between IL-6 increases and depressed mood
   increases. Implications of these sex differences in the neural
   correlates of cytokine-associated depressed mood and social pain are

Abstract = {{Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology.
   While the past decade has witnessed a proliferation of neuroimaging
   studies of autism, theoretical approaches for understanding
   systems-level brain abnormalities remain poorly developed. We propose a
   novel anterior insula-based systems-level model for investigating the
   neural basis of autism, synthesizing recent advances in brain network
   functional connectivity with converging evidence from neuroimaging
   studies in autism. The anterior insula is involved in interoceptive,
   affective and empathic processes, and emerging evidence suggests it is
   part of a ``salience network{''} integrating external sensory stimuli
   with internal states. Network analysis indicates that the anterior
   insula is uniquely positioned as a hub mediating interactions between
   large-scale networks involved in externally and internally oriented
   cognitive processing. A recent meta-analysis identifies the anterior
   insula as a consistent locus of hypoactivity in autism. We suggest that
   dysfunctional anterior insula connectivity plays an important role in
   autism. Critical examination of these abnormalities from a systems
   neuroscience perspective should be a priority for further research on
   the neurobiology of autism. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Disorders in verbal and emotional communication and imitation, social
   reciprocity and higher order cognition observed in individuals with
   autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are presented here as phenotypic
   expressions of temporo-spatial processing disorders (TSPDs). TSPDs
   include various degrees of disability in (i) processing multi-sensory
   dynamic stimuli online, (ii) associating them into meaningful and
   coherent patterns and (iii) producing real-time sensory-motor
   adjustments and motor outputs. In line with this theory, we found that
   slowing down the speed of facial and vocal events enhanced imitative,
   verbal and cognitive abilities in some ASD children, particularly those
   with low functioning autism. We then argue that TSPDs may result from
   Multi-system Brain Disconnectivity-Dissynchrony (MBD), defined as an
   increase or decrease in functional connectivity and neuronal
   synchronization within/between multiple neurofunctional territories and
   pathways. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
   electrophysiological studies supporting MBD are outlined. Finally, we
   review the suspected underlying neurobiological mechanisms of MBD as
   evidenced in neuroimaging, genetic, environmental and epigenetic
   studies. Overall, our TSPD/MBD approach to ASD may open new promising
   avenues for a better understanding of neuro-physio-psychopathology of
   ASD and clinical rehabilitation of people affected by these syndromes.

Abstract = {{Scientific understanding of social pain-the hurt feelings resulting from
   social rejection, separation, or loss-has been facilitated by the
   hypothesis that such feelings arise, in part, from some of the same
   neural and neurochemical systems that generate the unpleasant feelings
   resulting from physical pain. Accordingly, in animals, the painkiller
   morphine not only alleviates the distress of physical pain, but also the
   distress of social separation. Because morphine acts on the mu-opioid
   receptor, we examined whether variation in the mu-opioid receptor gene
   (OPRM1), as measured by the functional A118G polymorphism, was
   associated with individual differences in rejection sensitivity.
   Participants (n = 122) completed a self-report inventory of
   dispositional sensitivity to social rejection and a subsample (n = 31)
   completed a functional MRI session in which they were rejected from an
   online ball-tossing game played with two supposed others. The A118G
   polymorphism was associated with dispositional sensitivity to rejection
   in the entire sample and in the fMRI subsample. Consistent with these
   results, G allele carriers showed greater reactivity to social rejection
   in neural regions previously shown to be involved in processing social
   pain as well as the unpleasantness of physical pain, particularly the
   dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and anterior insula.
   Furthermore, dACC activity mediated the relationship between the A118G
   polymorphism and dispositional sensitivity to rejection, suggesting that
   this is a critical site for mu-opioid-related influence on social pain.
   Taken together, these data suggest that the A118G polymorphism
   specifically, and the mu-opioid receptor more generally, are involved in
   social pain in addition to physical pain.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive capacity is believed to decline with age, but it is not known
   whether this decline extends to tasks involving social cognition. In the
   current study, social neuroscience methodologies were used to examine
   the effects of age-related cognitive decline on older adults' abilities
   to engage regulatory mechanisms (which are typically impaired by normal
   aging) to inhibit negative reactions to stigmatized individuals. Older
   and young adults were presented with images of stigmatized individuals
   (e.g., individuals with amputations, substance abusers) and of normal
   controls while they underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging. All
   participants were also given a battery of tests to assess their
   executive function capacity. Young adults showed more activity in areas
   associated with empathy (i.e., media] prefrontal cortex) than did older
   adults when viewing stigmatized faces. By contrast, older adults with
   relatively preserved levels of executive function had heightened
   activity in areas previously implicated in emotion regulation (i.e.,
   lateral prefrontal cortex) as compared to other groups. These results
   suggest that although cognitive decline may interfere with older adults'
   attitudes toward stigmatized individuals, older adults with relatively
   preserved cognitive function may utilize different strategies to
   compensate for these deficits.}},

Abstract = {{To study the mesolimbic dopamine system during expectation and receipt
   or omission of rewards in partially remitted patients with schizophrenia
   treated with the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine.
   We studied 16 patients with a current episode of schizophrenia, all
   treated with the atypical drug olanzapine, and 16 healthy subjects using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects performed a delayed
   incentive paradigm with monetary rewards.
   During reward expectation, both, patients with schizophrenia and healthy
   control subjects, showed activation of the ventral striatum and midbrain
   in the vicinity of the ventral tegmental area. Significant categorical
   group differences emerged in the anterior cingulate cortex with only
   healthy controls showing increasing activation with increasing reward.
   In the patients, activation of this region was inversely correlated with
   positive symptoms. During outcome, both, patients with schizophrenia and
   healthy controls, showed activation of the ventral striatum and the
   mesial prefrontal cortex. Significant categorical group differences
   emerged in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex for the salience
   contrast with healthy controls showing a U-shaped activation curve,
   i.e., higher activation for either omission or receipt of reward
   compared to no reward.
   Our findings partially support the current concept of dopaminergic
   dysfunction in schizophrenia, suggesting a rather hyperactive mesolimbic
   dopamine system and reduced prefrontal activation, at least in partially
   remitted patients treated with atypical antipsychotics.}},

Abstract = {{Though the functional neural correlates of impaired cognitive control
   and social dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have been
   delineated, brain regions implicated in poor cognitive control of social
   information is a novel area of autism research. We recently reported in
   a non-clinical sample that detection of `social oddball' targets
   activated a portion of the dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus and the
   supracalcarine cortex (Dichter, Felder, Bodfish, Sikich, and Belger,
   2009). In the present investigation, we report functional magnetic
   resonance imaging results from individuals with ASD who completed the
   same social oddball task. Between-group comparisons revealed generally
   greater activation in the ASD group to both social and non-social
   targets. When responses to social and non-social targets were
   contrasted, the ASD group showed relatively greater activation in the
   right and middle inferior frontal gyri and a region in dorsomedial
   prefrontal cortex that abuts the dorsal anterior cingulate (Brodmann's
   Area 32). Further, dorsal anterior cingulate activation to social
   targets predicted the severity of social impairments in a subset of the
   ASD sample. These data suggest that the dorsal anterior cingulate
   mediates social target detection in neurotypical individuals and is
   implicated in deficits of cognitive control of social information in
   ASD.}},

Abstract = {{We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine
   whether depressed (vs non-depressed) adults showed differences in
   cortical activation in response to stimuli representing personal goals.
   Drawing upon regulatory focus theory as well as previous research, we
   predicted that depressed patients would manifest attenuated left
   orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) activation in response to their own promotion
   goals as well as exaggerated right OFC activation in response to their
   own prevention goals. Unmedicated adults with major depression (n = 22)
   and adults with no history of affective disorder (n = 14) completed
   questionnaires and a personal goal interview. Several weeks later, they
   were scanned during a judgment task which (unknown to them) included
   stimuli representing their promotion and prevention goals. Both groups
   showed similar patterns of task-related activation. Consistent with
   predictions, patients showed significantly decreased left OFC and
   increased right OFC activation compared to controls on trials in which
   they were exposed incidentally to their promotion and prevention goals,
   respectively. The results suggest that depression involves dysfunction
   in processing two important types of personal goals. The findings extend
   models of the etiology of depression to incorporate cognitive and
   motivational processes underlying higher order goal representation and
   ultimately may provide an empirical basis for treatment matching.}},

Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Phobic responses are strong emotional reactions towards phobic objects,
   which can be described as a deficit in the automatic regulation of
   emotions. Difficulties in the voluntary cognitive control of these
   emotions suggest a further phobia-specific deficit in effortful emotion
   regulation mechanisms. The actual study is based on this emotion
   regulation conceptualization of specific phobias. The aim is to
   investigate the neural correlates of these two emotion regulation
   deficits in spider phobics. Sixteen spider phobic females participated
   in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in which they
   were asked to voluntarily up- and down-regulate their emotions elicited
   by spider and generally aversive pictures with a reappraisal strategy.
   In line with the hypothesis concerning an automatic emotion regulation
   deficit, increased activity in the insula and reduced activity in the
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex was observed. Furthermore,
   phobia-specific effortful regulation within phobics was associated with
   altered activity in medial prefrontal cortex areas. Altogether, these
   results suggest that spider phobic subjects are indeed characterized by
   a deficit in the automatic as well as the effortful regulation of
   emotions elicited by phobic compared with aversive stimuli. These two
   forms of phobic emotion regulation deficits are associated with altered
   activity in different medial prefrontal cortex subregions.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigated whether emotionally expressive faces
   guide attention and modulate fMRI activity in fusiform gyrus in acquired
   prosopagnosia. Patient PS, a pure case of acquired prosopagnosia with
   intact right middle fusiform gyrus, performed two behavioral experiments
   and a functional imaging experiment to address these questions. In a
   visual search task involving face stimuli, PS was faster to select the
   target face when it was expressing fear or happiness as compared to when
   it was emotionally neutral. In a change detection task, PS detected
   significantly more changes when the changed face was fearful as compared
   to when it was neutral. Finally, an fMRI experiment showed enhanced
   activation to emotionally expressive faces and bodies in right fusiform
   gyrus. In addition, PS showed normal body-selective activation in right
   fusiform gyrus, partially overlapping the fusiform face area. Together
   these behavioral and neuroimaging results show that attention was
   preferentially allocated to emotional faces in patient PS, as observed
   in healthy subjects. We conclude that systems involved in the emotional
   guidance of attention by facial expression can function normally in
   acquired prosopagnosia, and can thus be dissociated from systems
   involved in face identification.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with Williams syndrome (WS), a genetically determined
   disorder, show relatively strong face-processing abilities despite poor
   visuospatial skills and depressed intellectual function. Interestingly,
   beginning early in childhood they also show an unusually high level of
   interest in face-to-face social interaction. We employed functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate physiological responses
   in face-sensitive brain regions, including ventral occipito-temporal
   cortex and the amygdala, in this unique genetic disorder. Participants
   included 17 individuals with WS, 17 age- and gender-matched healthy
   adults (chronological age-matched controls, CA) and 17 typically
   developing 8- to 9-year-old children (developmental age controls, DA).
   While engaged in a face discrimination task, WS participants failed to
   recruit the amygdala, unlike both CA and DA controls. WS fMRI responses
   in ventral occipito-temporal cortex, however, were comparable to those
   of DA controls. Given the integral role of the amygdala in social
   behavior, the failure of WS participants to recruit this region during
   face processing may be a neural correlate of the abnormally high
   sociability that characterizes this disorder.}},

Abstract = {{Reciprocity of trust is important for social interaction and depends on
   individual differences in social value orientation (SVO). Here, we
   examined the neural correlates of reciprocity by manipulating two
   factors that influence reciprocal behavior: (1) the risk that the
   trustor took when trusting and (2) the benefit for the trustee when
   being trusted. FMRI results showed that anterior Medial Prefrontal
   Frontal Cortex (aMPFC) was more active when participants defected
   relative to when participants reciprocated, but was not sensitive to
   manipulations of risk and benefit or individual differences in SVO.
   However, activation in the temporal-parietal-junction (rTPJ), bilateral
   anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was modulated by
   individual differences in SVO. In addition, these regions were
   differentially sensitive to manipulations of risk for the trustor when
   reciprocating. In contrast, the ACC and the right dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex were sensitive to the benefit for the trustee when
   reciprocating. Together, the results of this study provide more insight
   in how several brain regions work together when individuals reciprocate
   trust, by showing how these regions are differentially sensitive to
   reciprocity motives and perspective-taking.}},

Abstract = {{Major depression is associated with an excessive self-focus, a tendency
   to engage oneself in self-referential processing. The medial frontal
   gyrus (MFG) is central to self-referential processing. This study aimed
   to explore the neural bases of this excessive self-focus and to
   disambiguate the role of the MFG in the pathophysiology of major
   depression. We presented 15 depressed patients and 15 healthy subjects
   with personality traits during functional magnetic resonance imaging and
   asked them to judge whether each trait described them (self condition)
   or a generally desirable trait (general condition). Both patients and
   healthy subjects activated the MFG in self vs general condition.
   However, the activation of the dorsal part of the MFG and of the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in self vs general condition was
   unique to patients. Additionally, patients displayed an increased
   functional connectivity between the MFG, the dorsal anterior cingulate
   cortex and the DLPFC. These results provide evidence for an extended
   medial prefrontal network during self-referential processing in major
   depression, suggesting the involvement of a greater cognitive control.}},

Title = {{Playing Charades in the fMRI: Are Mirror and/or Mentalizing Areas
   Involved in Gestural Communication?}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},

Month = {{AUG 27}},
Abstract = {{Communication is an important aspect of human life, allowing us to
   powerfully coordinate our behaviour with that of others. Boiled down to
   its mere essentials, communication entails transferring a mental content
   from one brain to another. Spoken language obviously plays an important
   role in communication between human individuals. Manual gestures however
   often aid the semantic interpretation of the spoken message, and
   gestures may have played a central role in the earlier evolution of
   communication. Here we used the social game of charades to investigate
   the neural basis of gestural communication by having participants
   produce and interpret meaningful gestures while their brain activity was
   measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging. While participants
   decoded observed gestures, the putative mirror neuron system (pMNS:
   premotor, parietal and posterior mid-temporal cortex), associated with
   motor simulation, and the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), associated
   with mentalizing and agency attribution, were significantly recruited.
   Of these areas only the pMNS was recruited during the production of
   gestures. This suggests that gestural communication relies on a
   combination of simulation and, during decoding, mentalizing/agency
   attribution brain areas. Comparing the decoding of gestures with a
   condition in which participants viewed the same gestures with an
   instruction not to interpret the gestures showed that although parts of
   the pMNS responded more strongly during active decoding, most of the
   pMNS and the TPJ did not show such significant task effects. This
   suggests that the mere observation of gestures recruits most of the
   system involved in voluntary interpretation.}},

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) impact social functioning and
   communication, and individuals with these disorders often have
   restrictive and repetitive behaviors. Accumulating data indicate that
   ASD is associated with alterations of neural circuitry. Functional MRI
   (FMRI) studies have focused on connectivity in the context of
   psychological tasks. However, even in the absence of a task, the brain
   exhibits a high degree of functional connectivity, known as intrinsic or
   resting connectivity. Notably, the default network, which includes the
   posterior cingulate cortex, retro-splenial, lateral parietal
   cortex/angular gyrus, medial prefrontal cortex, superior frontal gyrus,
   temporal lobe, and parahippocampal gyrus, is strongly active when there
   is no task. Altered intrinsic connectivity within the default network
   may underlie offline processing that may actuate ASD impairments. Using
   FMRI, we sought to evaluate intrinsic connectivity within the default
   network in ASD. Relative to controls, the ASD group showed weaker
   connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and superior frontal
   gyrus and stronger connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex
   and both the right temporal lobe and right parahippocampal gyrus.
   Moreover, poorer social functioning in the ASD group was correlated with
   weaker connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and the
   superior frontal gyrus. In addition, more severe restricted and
   repetitive behaviors in ASD were correlated with stronger connectivity
   between the posterior cingulate cortex and right parahippocampal gyrus.
   These findings indicate that ASD subjects show altered intrinsic
   connectivity within the default network, and connectivity between these
   structures is associated with specific ASD symptoms. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Title = {{Beyond amygdala: Default Mode Network activity differs between patients

Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH BULLETIN}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{409-413}},
Month = {{AUG 14}},
Abstract = {{The Default Mode Network (DMN) is a constellation of brain areas that
   decrease their activity during a wide number of different goal-oriented
   tasks as compared to passive ``rest{''} tasks. DMN can be modulated by
   different factors such as emotional states, cognitive load of the task
   and psychopathology, including anxiety. Moreover, DMN seems to play a
   pivotal role in social cognition. For example, the ability to predict
   another person's behaviour taking his or her perspective modulates the
   activity of the DMN. Recent data from autistic patients support a role
   of DMN in social cognition as well. Social Phobia (SP) is an anxiety
   disorder characterized by an abnormal distress in situations that
   require social interaction. To date, no study has assessed DMN in Social
   Phobia. To determine potential differences in DMN activity between
   Social Phobia patients (SPP) and healthy control (HQ subjects we
   examined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data obtained
   during a face perception study with emotional and neutral stimuli. As
   compared to HC, SPP showed a lower deactivation in the precuneus and
   posterior cingulate regions (PCun/PCC) during task conditions. These
   regions are part of the so-called ``Theory of Mind{''} circuit and in
   particular they are involved in the evaluation of one's own emotional
   state.
   Because of the role of the PCun/PCC in self-state perception and
   attribution and, more in general, the role of the DMN in social
   cognition, we suggest that its impairment in the DMN network in SPP
   might be relevant in the development of the feeling of wariness of
   others' judgment and may be related to the so-called self-focused
   attention. Self-focused attention is the awareness of self-referent
   information, and is present in many emotional disorders and may
   additionally prevent individuals from observing external information
   that could disconfirm their own fears.
   Moreover, the abnormal modulation of activity in the DMN may reflect
   persistent rumination or anxiety-related thoughts that are not modulated
   by the switch from rest to task. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{In social contexts, facial expressions are dynamic in nature and vary
   rapidly in relation to situational requirements. However, there are very
   few fMRI studies using dynamic emotional stimuli. The aim of this study
   was (1) to introduce and evaluate a new stimulus database of static and
   dynamic emotional facial expressions according to arousal and
   recognizability investigated by a rating by both participants of the
   present fMRI study and by an external sample of 30 healthy women, (2) to
   examine the neural networks involved in emotion perception of static and
   dynamic facial stimuli separately, and (3) to examine the impact of
   motion on the emotional processing of dynamic compared to static face
   stimuli. A total of 16 females participated in the present fMRI study
   performing a passive emotion perception task including static and
   dynamic faces of neutral, happy and disgusted expressions. Comparing
   dynamic stimuli to static faces indicated enhanced emotion-specific
   brain activation patterns in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) including
   the amygdala (AMG), fusiform gyrus (FG), superior temporal gyrus (STG),
   inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and occipital and orbitofrontal cortex
   (OFC). These regions have been discussed to be associated with emotional
   memory encoding, the perception of threat, facial identity, biological
   motion, the mirror neuron system, an increase of emotional arousal, and
   reward processing, respectively. Post hoc ratings of the dynamic stimuli
   revealed a better recognizability in comparison to the static stimuli.
   In conclusion, dynamic facial expressions might provide a more
   appropriate approach to examine the processing of emotional face
   perception than static stimuli. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Visual perceptual learning is defined as performance enhancement on a
   sensory task and is distinguished from other types of learning and
   memory in that it is highly specific for location of the trained
   stimulus. The location specificity has been shown to be paralleled by
   enhancement in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal in
   the trained region of V1 {[}1-3] after visual training. Although
   recently the role of sleep in strengthening visual perceptual learning
   has attracted much attention, its underlying neural mechanism has yet to
   be clarified. Here, for the first time, fMRI measurement of human V1
   activation was conducted concurrently with a polysomnogram during sleep
   with and without preceding training for visual perceptual learning. As a
   result of predetermined region-of-interest analysis of Vi, activation
   enhancement during non-rapid-eye-movement sleep after training was
   observed specifically in the trained region of Vi. Furthermore,
   improvement of task performance measured subsequently to the
   post-training sleep session was significantly correlated with the amount
   of the trained-region-specific fMRI activation in Vi during sleep. These
   results suggest that as far as V1 is concerned, only the trained region
   is involved in improving task performance after sleep.}},

Abstract = {{Dopamine has a crucial role in the modulation of neurocognitive
   function, and synaptic dopamine activity is normally regulated by the
   dopamine transporter (DAT) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT).
   Perturbed dopamine function is a key pathophysiological feature of
   schizophrenia. Our objectives were (i) to examine epistasis between the
   DAT 3' UTR variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) and COMT Val158Met
   polymorphisms on brain activation during executive function, and (ii) to
   then determine the extent to which such interaction is altered in
   schizophrenia. Regional brain response was measured by using
   blood-oxygen-level-dependent fMRI during an overt verbal fluency task in
   85 subjects (44 healthy volunteers and 41 patients with DSM-IV
   schizophrenia), and inferences were estimated by using an ANOVA in SPM5.
   There was a significant COMT x DAT nonadditive interaction effect on
   activation in the left supramarginal gyrus, irrespective of diagnostic
   group (Z-score = 4.3; family-wise error (FWE) p = 0.03), and in healthy
   volunteers alone (Z-score = 4.7; FWEp = 0.006). In this region,
   relatively increased activation was detected only when COMT
   Met-158/Met-158 subjects also carried the 9-repeat DAT allele, or when,
   reversely, Val-158/Val-158 subjects carried the 10/10-repeat genotype.
   Also, there was a significant diagnosis x COMT x DAT nonadditive
   interaction in the right orbital gyrus (Z-score = 4.3; FWEp = 0.04),
   where, only within patients, greater activation was only associated with
   a 9-repeat allele and Val-158 conjunction, and with a 10-repeat and
   Met-158 conjunction (Z-score = 4.3; FWE p = 0.04). These data
   demonstrate that COMT and DAT genes interact nonadditively to modulate
   cortical function during executive processing, and also, that this
   effect is significantly altered in schizophrenia, which may reflect
   abnormal dopamine function in the disorder.}},

Abstract = {{Observing and learning actions and behaviors from others, a mechanism
   crucial for survival and social interaction, engages the mirror neuron
   system. To determine whether vision is a necessary prerequisite for the
   human mirror system to develop and function, we used functional magnetic
   resonance imaging to compare brain activity in congenitally blind
   individuals during the auditory presentation of hand-executed actions or
   environmental sounds, and the motor pantomime of manipulation tasks,
   with that in sighted volunteers, who additionally performed a visual
   action recognition task. Congenitally blind individuals activated a
   premotor-temporoparietal cortical network in response to aurally
   presented actions that overlapped both with mirror system areas found in
   sighted subjects in response to visually and aurally presented stimuli,
   and with the brain response elicited by motor pantomime of the same
   actions. Furthermore, the mirror system cortex showed a significantly
   greater response to motor familiar than to unfamiliar action sounds in
   both sighted and blind individuals. Thus, the mirror system in humans
   can develop in the absence of sight. The results in blind individuals
   demonstrate that the sound of an action engages the mirror system for
   action schemas that have not been learned through the visual modality
   and that this activity is not mediated by visual imagery. These findings
   indicate that the mirror system is based on supramodal sensory
   representations of actions and, furthermore, that these abstract
   representations allow individuals with no visual experience to interact
   effectively with others.}},

Abstract = {{Developmental dyslexia has been assumed to arise from general auditory
   deficits, compromising rapid temporal integration both Of linguistic and
   nonlinguistic acoustic stimuli. Because the effort of auditory temporal
   processing of speech and nonspeech test materials may depend oil
   presentation rate, fMRI measurements were performed ill dyslexics and
   controls during passive listening to series of syllable and click
   Sounds, using a parametric approach. Controls showed a decrease of
   hemodynamic brain activation within the right and all increase within
   the left anterior insula as a function Of the presentation rate both of
   click as well as syllable trains. By contrast, dyslexics exhibited this
   profile of hemodynamic responses under the nonspeech condition only. As
   concerns syllables, activation in dyslexics did not depend oil
   presentation rate. Moreover, a subtraction analysis of hemodynamic main
   effects across conditions and groups revealed decreased activation both
   of the left and right anterior insula in dyslexics compared to controls
   during application both of click and syllables. These results indicate,
   ill line with preceding studies, that the insula of both hemispheres is
   involved in auditory temporal processing of nonlinguistic auditory
   stimuli and demonstrate, furthermore, that these operations of
   intrasylvian cortex also extend to the linguistic domain. In addition,

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Blunted, inappropriate affective-social behavior is a
   hallmark of early schizophrenia, possibly corresponding to reduced
   ability to recognize and express emotions. It is yet unknown if this
   affective deficiency relates to disturbed neural sensitivity to facial
   expressions or to overall face processing. In a previous imaging Study,
   healthy Subjects showed less suppression of the fusiform gyrus (FG) to
   repeated presentation of the same trans figured-bizarre face relative to
   regular face. We assumed that the FG in schizophrenia will show reduced
   repetition related sensitivity to transfigured-bizarre faces, while
   having overall normal response to faces. Methods: Ten first-episode
   patients with schizophrenia and 10 controls rated the bizarreness of
   upright and inverted faces. In an fMRI study, another group of 17
   first-episode patients with schizophrenia and 12 controls viewed regular
   and transfigured-bizarre faces in blocks. Each block contained regular-
   or transfigured-bizarre faces of either different or same individual,
   presented in an upright or inverted orientation. Results: Patients in
   comparison with controls rated irregular faces as less bizarre. The FG,
   in patients and controls exhibited similar response to inverted faces,
   suggesting normal face processing. In contrast, the FG only in patients,
   showed similar suppression to repeated transfigured-bizarre and regular
   faces. Finally, the FG in patients compared with controls showed reduced
   functional connectivity with the amygdala and prefrontal cortex.
   Conclusion: Patients with schizophrenia already at first-episode, showed
   reduced behavioral and neural sensitivity to bizarre facial expressions.
   Possibly, this deficiency is related to disturbed modulations of
   emotion-related face processing in the FG by the amygdala and prefrontal
   cortex. Hum Brain Mapp 30:2606-2616, 2009. (c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Humans extract behaviorally significant meaning from a situation by
   integrating meanings from multiple components of a complex daily
   environment. To determine the neural underpinnings of this ability, the
   authors performed functional magnetic resonance imaging of healthy
   subjects while the latter viewed naturalistic scenes of two people and
   an object, including a threatening situation of a person being attacked
   by an offender with an object. The authors Used a two-factorial design:
   the object was either aversive or nonaversive, and the offender's action
   was either directed to the person or elsewhere. This allowed the authors
   to examine the neural response to object aversiveness and
   person-directed intention separately. A task Unrelated to threat was
   also Used to address incidental (i.e., subconscious or unintentional)
   detection. Assuming individual difference,, in incidental threat
   detection, the authors used a functional connectivity analysis using
   principal components analysis of intersubject variability. The left
   lateral orbitofrontal cortex and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) were
   specifically activated in response to a threatening situation. The
   threat-related component of intersubject variability was extracted from
   these data and showed a significant correlation with personality scores.
   There was also a correlation between threat-related intersubject
   variability and activation for object aversiveness in the left temporal
   pole and lateral orbitofrontal cortex; person-directed intention in the
   left superior frontal gyrus; threatening situations in the left MPFC;
   and independently for both factors in the right MPFC, Results
   demonstrate independent processing of object aversiveness and
   person-directed intention in the left temporal-orbitofrontal and
   superior frontal networks, respectively, and their integration into
   situational meaning in the MPFC. Hum Brain Mapp 30:2676-2688, 2009. (C)

Abstract = {{Objective and hypothesis: Nonlinear and linear methods of EEG-complexity
   analysis and autonomic measures were used to characterize processes
   accompanying performance in a mental arithmetic task challenged by low
   ({''}social{''}) alcohol doses. It was expected that alcohol in such
   doses will dampen changes of task-related EEG-synchronization in the
   theta band, and those of heart rate and electrodermal activity (EDA).
   Methods: In the mental arithmetic task addition and working memory,
   effort was required. The EEG, ECG and EDA were recorded in 5 conditions:
   task, placebo-task, low dose-task (0.2 g/kg alcohol), high dose-task
   (0.4 g/kg alcohol). Omega-complexity and synchronization likelihood (SL)
   were computed of the theta band of the EEG.
   Results: Task-related decrease of the Omega-complexity and increase of
   the SL was found in the theta frequency band. Following alcohol
   consumption, these changes did not develop as seen especially for SL in
   the anterior area, although the significant effects were elicited by
   task performance. Conspicuous task-evoked increases were observed for
   ECG and EDA which were even more enhanced by alcohol.
   Conclusions: Task-induced significant changes of the Omega-complexity
   and that of SL indicate increased synchrony in the theta band, probably
   corresponding to working memory effort. Both of these measures proved to
   be sensitive for the effect of low alcohol dose although these
   alcohol-elicited changes were not statistically significant.
   Task-induced heart rate and EDA increases were further intensified by
   alcohol probably indicating its activating effect on these autonomic
   measures in the dose range studied. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{It has long been understood that culture shapes individuals' behavior,
   but how this is accomplished in the human brain has remained largely
   unknown. To examine this, we made use of a well-established
   cross-cultural difference in behavior: American culture tends to
   reinforce dominant behavior whereas, conversely, Japanese culture tends
   to reinforce subordinate behavior. In 17 Americans and 17 Japanese
   individuals, we assessed behavioral tendencies towards dominance versus
   subordination and measured neural responses using fMRI during the
   passive viewing of stimuli related to dominance and subordination. In
   Americans, dominant stimuli selectively engaged the caudate nucleus,
   bilaterally, and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), whereas these were
   selectively engaged by subordinate stimuli in Japanese. Correspondingly,
   Americans self-reported a tendency towards more dominant behavior
   whereas Japanese self-reported a tendency towards more subordinate
   behavior. Moreover, activity in the right caudate and mPFC correlated
   with behavioral tendencies towards dominance versus Subordination, such
   that stronger responses in the caudate and mPFC to dominant stimuli were
   associated with more dominant behavior and stronger responses in the
   caudate and mPFC to subordinate stimuli were associated with more
   subordinate behavior. The findings provide a first demonstration that
   culture can flexibly shape functional activity in the mesolimbic reward
   system, which in turn may guide behavior. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Bilingual speakers must have effective neural mechanisms to control and

   control includes different control components. Using mixed blocked and
   event-related designs, the present study explored the Sustained and
   transient neural control of two languages during language processing. 15
   Chinese-English bilingual speakers were scanned when they performed
   language switching tasks. The results showed that, compared to the
   single language condition, sustained bilingual control (mixed language
   condition) induced activation in the bilateral inferior frontal, middle
   prefrontal and frontal gyri (BA 45/46). In contrast, relative to the no
   switch condition, transient bilingual control (language switching
   condition) activated the left inferior parietal lobule (BA 2/40),
   superior parietal lobule (BA 7), and middle frontal gyrus (BA 11/46).
   Importantly, the Fight superior parietal activity correlated with the
   magnitude of the mixing cost, and the left inferior and Superior
   parietal activity covaried with the magnitude of the asymmetric
   switching costs. These results Suggest that sustained and transient
   language control induced differential lateral activation patterns, and
   that sustained and transient activities in the human brain modulate the
   behavioral costs during switching-related language control, (C) 2008

Abstract = {{Sensitive gaze perception is critical for social interactions.
   Neuroimaging and neurophysiological results and the unique demands of
   gaze processing have led to suggestions that gaze is processed by
   different mechanisms than other aspects of faces. Neuropsychological
   data however provides little support for this possibility. We
   administered gaze discrimination tasks to six developmental
   prosopagnosics and one acquired prosopagnosic who exhibit identity
   perception deficits. First we examined whether the prosopagnosic
   participants could discriminate between straight and averted gaze
   normally. The performance of the control and prosopagnosic groups was
   very similar, and all of the prosopagnosics scored in the normal range.
   To assess whether the prosopagnosics represented gaze information like
   the controls, participants were tested on the discrimination task
   following adaptation to leftward and rightward gaze. The control and
   prosopagnosic groups both showed strong adaptation in the expected
   direction, and each prosopagnosic showed normal post-adaptation
   performance. These results indicate that gaze discrimination and
   representation is normal in these prosopagnosics. Their dissociation
   between impaired identity perception and normal gaze perception provides
   support for models of face processing suggesting that these aspects of
   face processing involve separate mechanisms. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Contemporary moral psychology often emphasizes the universality of moral
   judgments. Across age, gender, religion and ethnicity, people's
   judgments on classic dilemmas are sensitive to the same moral
   principles. In many cases, moral judgments depend not only on the
   outcome of the action, but on the agent's beliefs and intentions at the
   time of action. For example, we blame agents who attempt but fail to
   harm others, while generally forgiving agents who harm others
   accidentally and unknowingly. Nevertheless, as we report here, there are
   individual differences in the extent to which observers exculpate agents
   for accidental harms. Furthermore, we find that the extent to which
   innocent intentions are taken to mitigate blame for accidental harms is
   correlated with activation in a specific brain region during moral
   judgment. This brain region, the right temporo-parietal junction, has
   been previously implicated in reasoning about other people's thoughts,
   beliefs, and intentions in moral and non-moral contexts. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Compassion is one of the essential components which enable individuals
   to enter into and maintain relationships of caring. Compassion tends to
   motivate us to help people who are emotionally suffering. It is also
   known that a feeling of intrinsic reward may occur as a result of
   experiencing compassion for others. We conducted this study to
   understand the neural nature of compassion for other people's emotional
   state.
   Twenty-one healthy normal volunteers participated in this study. We used
   a 2 x 2 factorial design in which each subject was asked to assume a
   compassionate attitude or passive attitude while viewing the sad or
   neutral facial affective pictures during functional magnetic imaging.
   The main effect of a compassionate attitude was observed in the medial
   frontal cortex, the subgenual frontal cortex, the inferior frontal
   cortex and the midbrain regions. A test of the interaction between a
   compassionate attitude and sad facial affect revealed significant
   activations in the midbrain-ventral striatum/septal network region.
   The results of this study suggest that taking a compassionate attitude
   towards other people's sad expressions modulate the activities of the
   midbrain-ventral striatum/septal region network, which is known to play
   a role in the prosocial/social approach motivation and its accompanied
   rewarding feeling. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Curiosity has been described as a desire for learning and knowledge, but
   its underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We scanned subjects
   with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they read trivia
   questions. The level of curiosity when reading questions was correlated
   with activity in caudate regions previously suggested to be involved in
   anticipated reward. This finding led to a behavioral study, which showed
   that subjects spent more scarce resources (either limited tokens or
   waiting time) to find out answers when they were more curious. The
   functional imaging also showed that curiosity increased activity in
   memory areas when subjects guessed incorrectly, which suggests that
   curiosity may enhance memory for surprising new information. This
   prediction about memory enhancement was confirmed in a behavioral study:
   Higher curiosity in an initial session was correlated with better recall
   of surprising answers 1 to 2 weeks later.}},

Abstract = {{Attributional style means how people typically infer the causes of
   emotional behaviors. No study has shown neural basis of attributional
   style in schizophrenia, although it was suggested as a major area of
   social cognition research of schizophrenia. Fifteen patients with
   schizophrenia and 16 healthy controls underwent functional magnetic
   resonance imaging while performing three (happy, angry, and neutral)
   conditions of attribution task. Each condition included inferring
   situational causes of an avatar' (virtual character) emotional or
   neutral behavior. In the between-groups contrast maps of the happy
   conditions, the patient group compared to the control group showed
   decreased activations in the inferior frontal (BA 44) and the ventral
   premotor cortex (BA 6), in which the \% signal changes were associated
   with negative symptoms. In the angry conditions, the patient group
   compared to the control group exhibited increased activations in the
   precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (Pcu/PCC) (BA 7131), in which the
   \% signal changes were related to positive symptoms. In conclusion,
   patients with schizophrenia may have functional deficits in mirror
   neuron system when attributing positive behaviors, which may be related
   to a lack of inner simulation and empathy and negative symptoms. In
   contrast, patients may have increased activation in the Pcu/PCC related
   to self-representations while attributing negative behaviors. which may
   be related to failures in self- and source-monitoring and positive
   symptoms. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Few neuroimaging studies have reported gender differences in response to
   human emotions, and those that have examined such differences have
   utilized face photographs. This study presented not only human face
   photographs of positive and negative emotions, but also video vignettes
   of positive and negative social human interactions in an attempt to
   provide a more ecologically appropriate stimuli paradigm. Ten male and
   10 female healthy right-handed young adults were shown positive and
   negative affective social human faces and video vignettes to elicit
   gender differences in social/emotional perception. Conservative ROI
   (region of interest) analysis indicated greater male than female
   activation to positive affective photos in the anterior cingulate,
   medial frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus and superior temporal
   gyrus, all in the right hemisphere. No significant ROI gender
   differences were observed to negative affective photos. Male greater
   than female activation was seen in ROIs of the left posterior cingulate
   and the right inferior temporal gyrus to positive social videos. Male
   greater than female activation occurred in only the left middle temporal
   ROI for negative social videos. Consistent with previous findings, males
   were more lateralized than females. Although more activation was
   observed overall to video compared to photo conditions, males and
   females appear to process social video stimuli more similarly to one
   another than they do for photos. This study is a step forward in
   understanding the social brain with more ecologically valid stimuli that
   more closely approximates the demands of real-time social and affective
   processing. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Bayesian model selection (BMS) is a powerful method for determining the
   most likely among a set of competing hypotheses about the mechanisms
   that generated observed data. BMS has recently found widespread
   application in neuroimaging, particularly in the context of dynamic
   causal modelling (DCM). However, so far, combining BMS results from
   several subjects has relied on simple (fixed effects) metrics, e.g. the
   group Bayes factor (GBF), that do not account for group heterogeneity or
   outliers. In this paper, we compare the GBF with two random effects
   methods for BMS at the between-subject or group level. These methods
   provide inference on model-space using a classical and Bayesian
   perspective respectively. First, a classical (frequentist) approach uses
   the log model evidence as a subject-specific summary statistic. This
   enables one to use analysis of variance to test for differences in
   log-evidences over models, relative to inter-subject differences. We
   then consider the same problem in Bayesian terms and describe a novel
   hierarchical model, which is optimised to furnish a probability density
   on the models themselves. This new variational Bayes method rests on
   treating the model as a random variable and estimating the parameters of
   a Dirichlet distribution which describes the probabilities for all
   models considered. These probabilities then define a multinomial
   distribution over model space, allowing one to compute how likely it is
   that a specific model generated the data of a randomly chosen subject as
   well as the exceedance probability of one model being more likely than
   any other model. Using empirical and synthetic data, we show that
   optimising a conditional density of the model probabilities, given the
   log-evidences for each model over subjects, is more informative and
   appropriate than both the GBF and frequentist tests of the
   log-evidences. In particular, we found that the hierarchical Bayesian
   approach is considerably more robust than either of the other approaches
   in the presence of outliers. We expect that this new random effects
   method will prove useful for a wide range of group studies, not only in
   the context of DCM, but also for other modelling endeavours, e.g.
   comparing different Source reconstruction methods for EEG/MEG or
   selecting among competing computational models of learning and
   decision-making. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   However the neural mechanisms underpinning this effect remain poorly
   understood. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate
   the hollow-mask illusion in schizophrenic patients and healthy controls.
   The primary aim of this study was to use measures of effective
   connectivity arising from dynamic causal modelling (DCM) to explain
   differences in both the perception of the hollow-mask illusion and
   associated differences in neural responses between patients with
   schizophrenia and controls, which we hypothesised would be associated
   with difference in the influences of top-down and bottom-up processes
   between the groups. Consistent with this explanation, we identified
   differences between the two groups in effective connectivity. In
   particular, there was a strengthening of bottom-up processes, and
   weakening of top-down ones, during the presentation of `hollow' faces
   for the patients. in contrast, the controls exhibited a strengthening of
   top-down processes when perceiving the same stimuli. These findings
   suggest that schizophrenic patients rely on stimulus-driven processing
   and are less able to employ conceptually-driven top-down strategies
   during perception, where incoming sensory data are constrained with
   reference to a generative model that entails stored information from
   past experience. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Theories of empathy suggest that an accurate understanding of another's
   emotions should depend on affective, motor, and/or higher cognitive
   brain regions, but until recently no experimental method has been
   available to directly test these possibilities. Here, we present a
   functional imaging paradigm that allowed us to address this issue. We
   found that empathically accurate, as compared with inaccurate, judgments
   depended on (i) structures within the human mirror neuron system thought
   to be involved in shared sensorimotor representations, and (ii) regions
   implicated in mental state attribution, the superior temporal sulcus and
   medial prefrontal cortex. These data demostrate that activity in these 2
   sets of brain regions tracks with the accuracy of attributions made
   about another's internal emotional state. Taken together, these results
   provide both an experimental approach and theoretical insights for
   studying empathy and its dysfunction.}},

Abstract = {{Difficulties with pragmatic aspects of communication are universal
   across individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Here we
   focused on an aspect of pragmatic language comprehension that is
   relevant to social interaction in daily life: the integration of speaker
   characteristics inferred from the voice with the content of a message.
   Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined the
   neural correlates of the integration of voice-based inferences about the
   speaker's age, gender or social background, and sentence content in
   adults with ASD and matched control participants. Relative to the
   control group, the ASD group showed increased activation in right
   inferior frontal gyrus (RIFG; Brodmann area 47) for speaker-incongruent
   sentences compared to speaker-congruent sentences. Given that both
   groups performed behaviourally at a similar level on a debriefing
   interview outside the scanner, the increased activation in RIFG for the
   ASD group was interpreted as being compensatory in nature. It presumably
   reflects spill-over processing from the language dominant left
   hemisphere due to higher task demands faced by the participants with ASD
   when integrating speaker characteristics and the content of a spoken
   sentence. Furthermore, only the control group showed decreased
   activation for speaker-incongruent relative to speaker-congruent
   sentences in right ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC; Brodmann
   area 10), including right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; Brodmann area
   24/32). Since vMPFC is involved in self-referential processing related
   to judgments and inferences about self and others, the absence of such a
   modulation in vMPFC activation in the ASD group possibly points to
   atypical default self-referential mental activity in ASD. Our results
   show that in ASD compensatory mechanisms are necessary in implicit,
   low-level inferential processes in spoken language understanding. This
   indicates that pragmatic language problems in ASD are not restricted to
   high-level inferential processes, but encompass the most basic aspects
   of pragmatic language processing.}},

   studies showed that Broca's area is involved in the interaction between

   issue in three behavioral experiments. When compared to the expression
   of one signal at a time. arm kinematics slowed down and voice parameters
   were amplified when congruent words plus gestures were simultaneously
   produced (experiment 1). When word and gesture were incongruent, arm
   kinematics did not change regardless of word category, whereas the
   gesture induced variation in vocal parameters of communicative and
   action words only (experiments 2 and 3). Data are discussed according to
   the hypothesis that integration between gesture and word occurs by
   transferring the social intention to interact directly with the

Abstract = {{Human communication has been described as involving the coding-decoding
   of a conventional symbol system, which could be supported by parts of
   the human motor system (i.e. the ``mirror neurons system{''}). However,
   this view does not explain how these conventions could develop in the
   first place. Here we target the neglected but crucial issue of how
   people organize their non-verbal behavior to communicate a given
   intention without pre-established conventions. We have measured
   behavioral and brain responses in pairs of subjects during communicative
   exchanges occurring in a real, interactive, on-line social context. In
   two fMRI studies, we found robust evidence that planning new
   communicative actions (by a sender) and recognizing the communicative
   intention of the same actions (by a receiver) relied on spatially
   overlapping portions of their brains (the right posterior superior
   temporal sulcus). The response of this region was lateralized to the
   right hemisphere, modulated by the ambiguity in meaning of the
   communicative acts, but not by their sensorimotor complexity. These
   results indicate that the sender of a communicative signal uses his own
   intention recognition system to make a prediction of the intention
   recognition performed by the receiver. This finding supports the notion
   that our communicative abilities are distinct from both sensorimotor
   processes and language abilities.}},

Abstract = {{The mirror neuron system (MNS) is considered crucial for human imitation
   and language learning and provides the basis for the development of
   empathy and mentalizing. Alexithymia (ALEX), which refers to
   deficiencies in the self-awareness of emotional states, has been
   reported to be associated with poor ability in various aspects of social
   cognition such as mentalizing, cognitive empathy, and
   perspective-taking. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
   we measured the hemodynamic signal to examine whether there are
   functional differences in the MNS activity between participants with
   ALEX (n = 16) and without ALEX (n = 13), in response to a classic MNS
   task (i.e., the observation of video clips depicting goal-directed hand
   movements). Both groups showed increased neural activity in the premotor
   and the parietal cortices during observation of hand actions. However,
   activation was greater for the ALEX group than the non-ALEX group.
   Furthermore, activation in the left premotor area was negatively
   correlated with perspective-taking ability as assessed with the
   interpersonal reactivity index. The signal in parietal cortices was
   negatively correlated with cognitive facets assessed by the stress
   coping inventory and positively correlated with the neuroticism scale
   from the NEO five factor personality scale. h-v addition, in the ALEX
   group, activation in the right superior parietal region showed a
   positive correlation with the severity of ALEX as measured by a
   structured interview. These results suggest that the stronger
   MNS-related neural response in individuals scoring high on ALEX is
   associated with their insufficient self-other differentiation. Hum Brain

Abstract = {{Although there is ample evidence that motor imagery activates similar
   cerebral regions to those solicited during actual movements, it is still
   unknown whether visual (VI) and kinesthetic imagery (KI) recruit
   comparable or distinct neural networks. The present study was thus
   designed to identify, through functional magnetic resonance imaging at
   3.0 Tesla in 13 skilled imagers, the cerebral structures implicated in
   VI and KI. Participants were scanned in a perceptual control condition
   and while physically executing or focusing during motor imagery on
   either the visual or kinesthetic components of an explicitly known
   sequence of finger movements. Subjects' imagery abilities were assessed
   using well-established psychological, chronometric, and new
   physiological measures from the autonomic nervous system. Compared with
   the perceptual condition, physical executing, VI, and KI resulted in
   overlapping (albeit non-identical) brain activations, including
   motor-related regions and the inferior and superior parietal lobules. By
   contrast, a divergent pattern of increased activity was observed when VI
   and KI were compared directly: VI activated predominantly the occipital
   regions and the superior parietal lobules, whereas KI yielded more
   activity in motor-associated structures and the inferior parietal
   lobule. These results suggest that VI and KI are mediated through
   separate neural systems, which contribute differently during processes
   of motor learning and neurological rehabilitation. Hum Brain Mapp

Abstract = {{Expectations for what functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can
   offer psychophysiology vary greatly. Overreaching enthusiasm such as the
   idea that fMRI can reveal lies and political attitudes are as common as
   the opinion that fMRI, in its current form, is useless for the
   advancement of psychological theories. Errors in the inferences being
   drawn from fMRI data may be contributing to each of these extreme
   positions, so the present paper addresses these several common
   inferential errors and describes some of the potential of fMRI for
   psychophysiological theory and research. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{An fMRI Investigation of Spontaneous Mental State Inference for Moral
   Judgment}},

Abstract = {{Human moral judgment depends critically on ``theory of mind,'' the
   capacity to represent the mental states of agents. Recent studies
   suggest that the right TPJ (RTPJ) and, to lesser extent, the left TPJ
   (LTPJ), the precuneus (PC), and the medial pFC (MPFC) are robustly
   recruited when participants read explicit statements of an agent's
   beliefs and then judge the moral status of the agent's action.
   Real-world interactions, by contrast, often require social partners to
   infer each other's mental states. The current study uses fMRI to probe
   the role of these brain regions in supporting spontaneous mental state
   inference in the service of moral judgment. Participants read
   descriptions of a protagonist's action and then either (i) ``moral''
   facts about the action's effect on another person or (ii) ``nonmoral''
   facts about the situation. The RTPJ, PC, and MPFC were recruited
   selectively for moral over nonmoral facts, suggesting that processing
   moral stimuli elicits spontaneous mental state inference. In a second
   experiment, participants read the same scenarios, but explicit
   statements of belief preceded the facts: Protagonists believed their
   actions would cause harm or not. The response in the RTPJ, PC, and LTPJ
   was again higher for moral facts but also distinguished between neutral
   and negative outcomes. Together, the results illuminate two aspects of
   theory of mind in moral judgment: (1) spontaneous belief inference and
   (2) stimulus-driven belief integration.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY \& NEUROSCIENCE}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background: Functional brain imaging studies have demonstrated amygdala
   and insula hyper-reactivity to probes of social threat in participants
   with generalized social anxiety disorder (gSAD). The amygdala and insula
   are known to serve broad functions in emotional processing, including
   integration of affective information. However, few studies have examined
   brain responses in socially anxious participants during general
   emotional processing. We examined brain response to emotionally
   evocative images in patients with gSAD and matched healthy controls.
   Methods: Eleven patients with gSAD who were not taking psychotropic
   medications and did not have psychiatric comorbidities and 11 matched
   healthy controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while
   viewing blocks of emotionally salient (positive, negative, neutral)
   pictures. Results: Participants with gSAD exhibited enhanced bilateral
   amygdala and insula reactivity to negative (v. neutral) images compared
   with healthy controls who did not exhibit enhanced reactivity. Within
   the gSAD group, the extent of amygdala activation was correlated with
   social anxiety severity, whereas the extent of insula activation was
   correlated with trait anxiety. Limitations: The small sample size may
   have limited our ability to detect group differences in other relevant
   brain regions and in behavioural measures. Conclusion: In addition to
   prior findings of probes of social information processing, our findings
   suggest that the amygdala and insula responses are hyper-reactive to
   general emotional images with negative emotional content and that these
   brain regions may play divergent roles in their representation of
   different phenotypes.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive reserve (CR) is the brain's capacity to cope with cerebral
   damage to minimize clinical manifestations. The `passive model'
   considers head or brain measures as anatomical substrates of CR, whereas
   the `active model' emphasizes the use of brain networks effectively.
   Sixteen healthy subjects, 12 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
   and 16 cases with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) were included to
   investigate the relationships between proxies of CR and cerebral
   measures considered in the `passive' and `active' models. CR proxies
   were inferred premorbid IQ (WAIS Vocabulary test),
   `education-occupation', a questionnaire of intellectual and social
   activities and a composite CR measure. MRI-derived whole-brain volumes
   and brain activity by functional MRI during a. visual encoding task were
   obtained. Among healthy elders, higher CR was related to larger brains
   and reduced activity during cognitive processing, suggesting more
   effective use of cerebral networks. In contrast, higher CR was
   associated with reduced brain volumes in MCI and AD and increased brain
   function in the latter, indicating more advanced neuropathology but that
   active compensatory mechanisms are still at work in higher CR patients.
   The right superior temporal gyrus (BA 22) and the left superior parietal
   lobe (BA 7) showed greatest significant differences in direction of
   slope with CR and activation between controls and AD cases. Finally, a
   regression analysis revealed that fMRI patterns were more closely
   related to CR proxies than brain volumes. Overall, inverse relationships
   for healthy and pathological aging groups emerged between brain
   structure and function and CR variables. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{92}},

Abstract = {{The issue concerning the neuronal basis of true and false recognition is
   still a subject of extensive debate. In the present study voxel based
   morphometry (VBM) was used to examine structural brain correlates of
   these processes. Since several studies indicate that emotional content
   facilitates false recognition we decided to use emotional stimuli.
   Behavioral measures, i.e., true and false recognition rates were used as
   covariants in VBM analyses. VBM results indicated that the true
   recognition correlated positively with grey-matter (GM) density in
   bilateral amygdala, anterior cingulate and middle temporal gyrus, i.e.,
   brain regions, involved in the memory of emotional material, as revealed
   by fMRI results. False recognition correlated negatively with GM density
   in prefrontal areas (BA47 and BA9), supporting the role of the
   prefrontal cortex in monitoring retrieval and limiting the probability
   of false recognition. Thus our VBM findings (i) point to the brain
   structures critical for correct and false emotional memory and (ii)
   disclose structural differences between the neural bases of these two
   types of memory. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to grasp emotional messages in everyday gestures and respond
   to them is at the core of successful social communication. The
   hypothesis that abnormalities in socio-emotional behavior in people with
   autism are linked to a failure to grasp emotional significance conveyed

   perception of fearful or neutral actions and showed that whereas similar
   activation of brain regions known to play a role in action perception
   was revealed in both autistics and controls, autistics failed to
   activate amygdala, inferior frontal gyrus and premotor cortex when
   viewing gestures expressing fear. Our results support the notion that
   dysfunctions in this network may contribute significantly to the
   characteristic communicative impairments documented in autism. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Reward-related dopaminergic influences on learning and overt behaviour
   are well established, but any influence on sensory decision-making is
   largely unknown. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI)
   while participants judged electric somatosensory stimuli on one hand or

   visual signal, at one of four anticipated financial levels. Prior to the
   procedure, participants received either placebo (saline), a dopamine
   agonist (levodopa), or an antagonist (haloperidol). Principal findings:
   higher anticipated reward improved tactile decisions. Visually signalled
   reward reactivated primary somatosensory cortex for the judged hand,
   more strongly for higher reward. After receiving a higher reward on one
   trial, somatosensory activations and decisions were enhanced on the next
   trial. These behavioural and neural effects were all enhanced by
   levodopa and attenuated by haloperidol, indicating dopaminergic
   dependency. Dopaminergic reward-related influences extend even to early
   somatosensory cortex and sensory decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Social anxiety often involves a combination of
   hypervigilance and avoidance to potentially warning signals including
   the facial expression of emotions. Functional imaging has demonstrated
   an increase in amygdala response to emotional faces in subjects with
   social anxiety. Nevertheless, it is unclear to what extent visual areas
   processing faces influence amygdala reactivity in different socially
   anxious individuals. We assessed the influence of the fusiform gyrus
   activation on amygdala response to emotional faces in the non-clinical
   range of social anxiety.
   Method. Twenty-two normal subjects showing a wide range in social
   anxiety scores were examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) during the processing of happy and fearful faces. A dimensional
   analysis approach was used involving voxel-wise mapping of the
   correlation between Subjects' social anxiety scores and amygdala
   activation, before and after controlling for fusiform gyrus activation.
   Results. We observed that only after controlling for subjects' level of
   activation of the fusiform gyrus was there an association between social
   anxiety ratings and amygdala response to both happy and fearful faces.
   The fusiform gyrus influence was more robust during the fear condition.
   Of note, fusiform gyrus response to fearful faces showed a negative
   correlation with additional behavioral assessments related to avoidance,
   including social anxiety scores, harm avoidance and sensitivity to
   punishment.
   Conclusions. Relevant interactions among the emotional face-processing
   stages exist in the non-clinical range of social anxiety that may
   ultimately attenuate amygdala responses. Future research will help to
   establish the role of this effect in a clinical context.}},

Abstract = {{Previous evidence suggests that directional social cues (e.g., eye gaze)
   cause automatic shifts in attention toward gaze direction. It has been
   proposed that automatic attentional orienting driven by social cues
   (social orienting) involves a different neural network from automatic
   orienting driven by nonsocial cues. However, previous neuroimaging
   studies on social orienting have only compared gaze cues to symbolic
   cues, which typically engage top-down mechanisms. Therefore, we directly
   compared the neural activity involved in social orienting to that
   involved in purely automatic nonsocial orienting. Twenty participants
   performed a spatial cueing task consisting of social (gaze) cues and
   automatic nonsocial (peripheral squares) cues presented at short and
   long stimulus (cue-to-target) onset asynchronies (SOA), while undergoing
   fMRI. Behaviorally, a facilitation effect was found for both cue types
   at the short SOA, while an inhibitory effect (inhibition of return: IOR)
   was found only for nonsocial cues at the long SOA. Imaging results
   demonstrated that social and nonsocial cues recruited a largely
   overlapping fronto-parietal network. In addition, social cueing evoked
   greater activity in occipito-temporal regions at both SOAs, while
   nonsocial cueing recruited greater subcortical activity, but only for
   the long SOA (when IOR was found). A control experiment, including
   central arrow cues, confirmed that the occipito-temporal activity was at
   least in part due to the social nature of the cue and not simply to the
   location of presentation (central vs. peripheral). These results suggest
   an evolutionary trajectory for automatic orienting, from predominantly
   subcortical mechanisms for nonsocial orienting to predominantly cortical
   mechanisms for social orienting.}},

Abstract = {{Humans can guide their actions toward the realization of their
   intentions. Flexible, rapid and precise realization of intentions and
   goals relies on the brain learning to control its actions on external
   objects and to predict the consequences of this control. Neural
   mechanisms that mimic the input-output properties of our own body and
   other objects can be used to support prediction and control, and such
   mechanisms are called internal models. We first summarize functional
   neuroimaging, behavioral and computational studies of the brain
   mechanisms related to acquisition, modular organization, and the
   predictive switching of internal models mainly for tool use. These
   mechanisms support predictive control and flexible switching of
   intentional actions. We then review recent studies demonstrating that
   internal models are crucial for the execution of not only immediate
   actions but also higher-order cognitive functions, including
   optimization of behaviors toward long-term goals, social interactions
   based on prediction of others' actions and mental states, and language
   processing. These studies suggest that a concept of internal models can
   consistently explain the neural mechanisms and computational principles
   needed for fundamental sensorimotor functions as well as higher-order
   cognitive functions.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Human actions are often classified as either internally generated, or
   externally specified in response to environmental cues. These two modes
   of action selection have distinct neural bases, but few studies
   investigated how the mode of action selection affects the subjective
   experience of action. We measured the experience of action using the
   subjective compression of the interval between actions and their
   effects, known as `temporal binding'. Participants performed either a
   left or a right key press, either in response to a specific cue, or as
   they freely chose. Moreover, the time of each keypress could either be
   explicitly cued to occur in one of two designated time intervals, or
   participants freely chose in which interval to act. Each action was
   followed by a specific tone. Participants judged the time of their
   actions or the time of the tone. Temporal binding was found for both
   internally generated and for stimulus-based actions. However, the amount
   of binding depended on whether or not both the choice and the timing of
   action were selected in the same way. Stronger binding was observed when
   both action choice and action timing were internally generated or
   externally specified, compared to conditions where the two parameters
   were selected by different routes. Our result suggests that temporal
   action-effect binding depends on how actions are selected. Binding is
   strongest when actions result from a single mode of selection.}},

Abstract = {{Mirror neurons fire both when a primate executes a transitive action
   directed toward a target (e.g., grasping) and when he observes the same
   action performed by another. According to the prevalent interpretation,
   action-mirroring is a process of interpersonal neural similarity whereby
   an observer maps the agent's perceived movements onto her own motor
   repertoire. Furthermore, ever since Gallese and Goldman's (1998)
   influential paper, action-mirroring has been linked to third-person
   mindreading on the grounds that it enables an observer to represent the
   agent's intention. In this paper, I criticize the prevalent
   interpretation on two grounds. First, action-mirroring could not result
   in interpersonal neural similarity unless there was a single mechanism
   active at different times in a single brain during the execution and the
   perception of acts of grasping. Second, such a neural mechanism is
   better conceived as underlying the possession of the concept of grasping
   than as a basis for mindreading.}},

Abstract = {{The human brain demonstrates complex yet systematic patterns of neural
   activity at rest. We examined whether functional connectivity among
   those brain regions typically active during rest depends on ongoing and
   recent task demands and individual differences. We probed the temporal
   coordination among these regions during periods of language
   comprehension and during the rest periods that followed comprehension.
   Our findings show that the topography of this ``rest network'' varies
   with exogenous processing demands. The network encompassed more highly
   interconnected regions during rest than during listening, but also when
   listening to unsurprising vs. surprising information. Furthermore,
   connectivity patterns during rest varied as a function of recent
   listening experience. Individual variability in connectivity strength
   was associated with cognitive function: more attentive comprehenders
   demonstrated weaker connectivity during language comprehension, and a
   greater differentiation between connectivity during comprehension and
   rest. The regions we examined have generally been thought to form an
   invariant physiological and functional network whose activity reflects
   spontaneous cognitive processes. Our findings suggest that their
   function extends beyond the mediation of unconstrained thought, and that
   they play an important role in higher-level cognitive function.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to determine if perospirone, a second
   generation antipsychotic drug and partial agonist at serotonin-5-HT(1A)
   receptors, enhances electrophysiological activity, such as event-related
   potentials (ERPs), in frontal brain regions, as well as cognitive
   function in subjects with schizophrenia. P300 current source images were
   obtained by means of standardized low resolution brain electromagnetic
   tomography (sLORETA) before and after treatment with perospirone for 6
   months. Perospirone significantly increased P300 current source density
   in the left superior frontal gyrus, and improved positive symptoms and
   performance on the script tasks, a measure of verbal social cognition,
   while verbal learning memory tended to be improved. There was a
   significant correlation between the changes in P300 amplitude on the
   left frontal lead and those in social cognition. These results suggest
   the changes in three-dimensional distribution of cortical activity, as
   demonstrated by sLORETA, may mediate some of the actions of
   antipsychotic drugs. The distinct cognition-enhancing profile of
   perospirone in patients with schizophrenia may be related to its actions
   on 5-HT(1A) receptors. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Face processing is crucial to social interaction, but is impaired in
   schizophrenia patients, who experience delays in face recognition,
   difficulties identifying others, and misperceptions of affective
   content. The right fusiform face area plays an important role in the
   early stages of human face processing and thus may be affected in
   schizophrenia. The aim of the study was therefore to investigate whether
   face processing deficits are related to dysfunctions of the right
   fusiform face area in schizophrenia patients compared with controls. In
   a rapid, event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   design, we investigated the encoding of new faces, as well as the
   recognition of newly learned, famous, and unfamiliar faces, in 13
   schizophrenia patients and 21 healthy controls. We applied region of
   interest analysis to each individual's right fusiform face area and
   tested for group differences. Controls displayed higher blood
   oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) activation during the memorization of
   faces that were later successfully recognized. In schizophrenia
   patients, this effect was not observed. During the recognition task,
   schizophrenia patients exhibited lower BOLD responses, less accuracy,
   and longer reaction times to famous and unfamiliar faces. Our results
   support the hypothesis that impaired face processing in schizophrenia is
   related to early-stage deficits during the encoding and recognition of
   faces. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Emotional instability is a hallmark feature of borderline personality
   disorder (BPD), yet its biological underpinnings are poorly understood.
   We employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare
   patterns of regional brain activation in BPD patients and healthy
   volunteers as they process positive and negative social emotional
   stimuli. fMRI images were acquired while 19 BPD patients and 17 healthy
   controls (HC) viewed emotion-inducing pictures from the International
   Affective Pictures System set. Activation data were analyzed with SPM5
   ANCOVA models to derive the effects of diagnosis and stimulus type. BPD
   patients demonstrated greater differences in activation than controls,
   when viewing negative pictures compared with rest, in the amygdala,
   fusiform gyrus, primary visual areas, superior temporal gyrus (STG), and
   premotor areas, while healthy controls showed greater differences than
   BPD patients in the insula, middle temporal gyrus and dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex (BA46). When viewing positive pictures compared with
   rest, BPD patients showed greater differences in the STG, premotor
   cortex, and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that
   BPD patients show greater amygdala activity and heightened activity of
   visual processing regions relative to findings for HC subjects in the
   processing of negative social emotional pictures compared with rest. The
   patients activate neural networks in emotion processing that are
   phylogeneticall older and more reflexive than those activated by HC
   subjects. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Regulation of emotion is important for adaptive social functioning and
   mental well-being. This functional magnetic resonance imaging study
   identified neural correlates of regulation of positive or negative
   emotion. Twelve healthy female Chinese participants performed the
   experimental task that required them to simply view emotional pictures
   or to regulate their emotions induced by these pictures while their
   brain activities were monitored by a 1.5 T MRI scanner. The
   neuroirnaging findings indicate that the left superior and lateral
   frontal regions (BA8/9) are common neural correlates of regulation of
   both emotions. For regulation of positive or negative emotion, changes
   of BOLD responses in the prefrontal regions and the left insula are
   associated with regulation of positive emotion; whereas activity of the
   left orbitofrontal gyrus, the left superior frontal gyrus, and the
   anterior cingulate gyrus appears to be involved in regulation of
   negative emotion. According to the participants' self-report, they
   appeared to be more effective in regulating positive than negative
   emotions, which may relate to the distinct patterns of neural activity
   associated with regulation of the specific emotion. As a conclusion, our
   findings suggest that there are shared as well as valence-specific
   neurocognitive mechanisms underlying regulation of positive and negative
   emotions. Enhanced knowledge about the neural mechanisms of emotion
   regulation helps improve understanding of the complex interplay of
   emotion and cognition underlying human behaviors. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Recent fMRI studies linked subgenual cingulate cortex (SCC) activity
   with feelings of guilt for acting counter to social values and

   the association of empathic concern and strength of SCC activation in
   response to guilt- and compassion-evoking verbal descriptions of social
   behaviour. We were able to confirm our prediction that participants with
   higher empathic concern had increased activity in the SCC in the guilt
   condition, whereas there was no association for compassion. These

Abstract = {{The communication of stress/anxiety between conspecifics through
   chemosensory signals has been documented in many vertebrates and
   invertebrates. Here, we investigate how chemosensory anxiety signals
   conveyed by the sweat of humans (N = 49) awaiting an academic
   examination are processed by the human brain, as compared to
   chemosensory control signals obtained from the same sweat donors in a
   sport condition. The chemosensory stimuli were pooled according to the
   donation condition and administered to 28 participants (14 males)
   synchronously to breathing via an olfactometer. The stimuli were
   perceived with a low intensity and accordingly only about half of the
   odor presentations were detected by the participants. The fMRI results
   (event-related design) show that chemosensory anxiety signals activate
   brain areas involved in the processing of social emotional stimuli
   (fusiform gyrus), and in the regulation of empathic feelings (insula,
   precuneus, cingulate cortex). In addition, neuronal activity within
   attentional (thalamus, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex) and emotional
   (cerebellum, vermis) control systems were observed. The chemosensory
   perception of human anxiety seems to automatically recruit
   empathy-related resources. Even though the participants could not
   attentively differentiate the chemosensory stimuli, emotional contagion
   seems to be effectively mediated by the olfactory system.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to correctly interpret emotional signals from others is
   crucial for successful social interaction. Previous neuroimaging studies
   showed that voice-sensitive auditory areas {[}1-3] activate to a broad
   spectrum of vocally expressed emotions more than to neutral speech
   melody (prosody). However, this enhanced response occurs irrespective of
   the specific emotion category, making it impossible to distinguish
   different vocal emotions with conventional analyses {[}4-8]. Here, we
   presented pseudowords spoken in five prosodic categories (anger,
   sadness, neutral, relief, joy) during event-related functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI), then employed multivariate pattern analysis
   {[}9, 10] to discriminate between these categories on the basis of the
   spatial response pattern within the auditory cortex. Our results
   demonstrate successful decoding of vocal emotions from fMRI responses in
   bilateral voice-sensitive areas, which could not be obtained by using
   averaged response amplitudes only. Pairwise comparisons showed that each
   category could be classified against all other alternatives, indicating
   for each emotion a specific spatial signature that generalized across
   speakers. These results demonstrate for the first time that emotional
   information is represented by distinct spatial patterns that can be
   decoded from brain activity in modality-specific cortical areas.}},

Abstract = {{We used functional MRI (fMRI) to investigate human mental processes in a
   competitive interactive setting-the ``beauty contest{''} game. This game
   is well-suited for investigating whether and how a player's mental
   processing incorporates the thinking process of others in strategic
   reasoning. We apply a cognitive hierarchy model to classify subject's
   choices in the experimental game according to the degree of strategic
   reasoning so that we can identify the neural substrates of different
   levels of strategizing. According to this model, high-level reasoners
   expect the others to behave strategically, whereas low-level reasoners
   choose based on the expectation that others will choose randomly. The
   data show that high-level reasoning and a measure of strategic IQ
   (related to winning in the game) correlate with the neural activity in
   the medial prefrontal cortex, demonstrating its crucial role in
   successful mentalizing. This supports a cognitive hierarchy model of
   human brain and behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Ethologist Konrad Lorenz defined the baby schema ({''}Kindchenschema'')
   as a set of infantile physical features, such as round face and big
   eyes, that is perceived as cute and motivates caretaking behavior in the
   human, with the evolutionary function of enhancing offspring survival.
   The neural basis of this fundamental altruistic instinct is not well
   understood. Prior studies reported a pattern of brain response to
   pictures of children, but did not dissociate the brain response to baby
   schema from the response to children. Using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging and controlled manipulation of the baby schema in
   infant faces, we found that baby schema activates the nucleus accumbens,
   a key structure of the mesocorticolimbic system mediating reward
   processing and appetitive motivation, in nulliparous women. Our findings
   suggest that engagement of the mesocorticolimbic system is the
   neurophysiologic mechanism by which baby schema promotes human
   caregiving, regardless of kinship.}},

Abstract = {{Habits are characterized by an insensitivity to their consequences and,
   as such, can be distinguished from goal-directed actions. The neural
   basis of the development of demonstrably outcome-insensitive habitual
   actions in humans has not been previously characterized. In this
   experiment, we show that extensive training on a free-operant task
   reduces the sensitivity of participants' behavior to a reduction in
   outcome value. Analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data
   acquired during training revealed a significant increase in task-related
   cue sensitivity in a right posterior putamen-globus pallidus region as
   training progressed. These results provide evidence for a shift from
   goal-directed to habit-based control of instrumental actions in humans,
   and suggest that cue-driven activation in a specific region of
   dorsolateral posterior putamen may contribute to the habitual control of
   behavior in humans.}},

Title = {{Shared and disorder-specific prefrontal abnormalities in boys with pure

Abstract = {{Inhibitory and attention deficits have been suggested to be shared
   problems of disruptive behaviour disorders. Patients with attention
   deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and patients with conduct disorder
   (CD) show deficits in tasks of attention allocation and interference
   inhibition. However, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of
   inhibitory and attention control has only been investigated in patients
   with ADHD, including comorbidity with CD, finding fronto-striatal and
   temporo-parietal dysfunction. This study investigates differences and
   commonalities in functional neural networks mediating interference
   inhibition and attention allocation between medication-naive children
   and adolescents with pure CD and those with pure ADHD.
   Event-related fMRI was used to compare brain activation of 13 boys with
   non-comorbid CD, 20 boys with non-comorbid ADHD and 20 healthy
   comparison boys during a Simon task that measures interference
   inhibition and controls for attention allocation, thus tapping into
   interference inhibition and selective attention networks.
   During interference inhibition, both patient groups shared reduced
   activation compared to controls in right superior temporal lobe and in
   predominantly right precuneus. During the oddball condition, both
   patient groups showed reduced activation compared to healthy control
   children in right medial prefrontal lobe. However, only ADHD patients
   showed a disorder-specific under-activation compared to the other two
   groups in an extensive activation cluster in left inferior prefrontal
   cortex.
   This study shows shared dysfunction in both patients groups in right
   hemispheric temporal and parietal brain regions during interference
   inhibition and in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during attention
   allocation. Ventrolateral prefrontal dysfunction, however, was specific
   to ADHD and not observed in patients with CD in the context of attention
   allocation. The findings suggest that the typically reduced functional
   activation in patients with ADHD in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex may
   be specific to the disorder, at least when compared to patients with CD.}},

Abstract = {{By combining the false belief (FB) and photo (PH) vignettes to identify
   theory-of-mind areas with the false sign (FS) vignettes, we re-establish
   the functional asymmetry between the left and right temporo-parietal
   junction (TPJ). The right TPJ (TPJ-R) is specially sensitive to
   processing belief information, whereas the left TPJ (TPJ-L) is equally
   responsible for FBs as well as FSs. Measuring BOLD at two time points in
   each vignette, at the time the FB-inducing information (or lack of
   information) is presented and at the time the test question is
   processed, made clear that the FB is processed spontaneously as soon as
   the relevant information is presented and not on demand for answering
   the question in contrast to extant behavioral data. Finally, a fourth,
   true belief vignette (TB) required teleological reasoning, that is,
   prediction of a rational action without any doubts being raised about
   the adequacy of the actor's information about reality. Activation by
   this vignette supported claims that the TPJ-R is activated by TBs as
   well as FBs.}},

Abstract = {{Theories of embodied cognition hold that higher cognitive processes
   operate on perceptual symbols and that concept use involves partial
   reactivations of the sensory-motor states that occur during experience
   with the world. On this view, the processing of emotion knowledge
   involves a (partial) reexperience of an emotion, but only when access to
   the sensory basis of emotion knowledge is required by the task. In 2
   experiments, participants judged emotional and neutral concepts
   corresponding to concrete objects (Experiment 1) and abstract states
   (Experiment 2) while facial electromyographic activity was recorded from
   the cheek, brow, eye, and nose regions. Results of both studies show
   embodiment of specific emotions in an emotion-focused but not a
   perceptual-focused processing task on the same words. A follow up in
   Experiment 3, which blocked selective facial expressions, suggests a
   causal, rather than simply a correlational, role for embodiment in
   emotion word processing. Experiment 4, using a property generation task,
   provided support for the conclusion that emotions embodied in conceptual
   tasks are context-dependent situated simulations rather than associated
   emotional reactions. Implications for theories of embodied simulation
   and for emotion theories are discussed.}},

   substrates of such complex social behaviors. We hypothesized that the

   more active for high than low importance advice. Results indicated that
   high importance advice was associated with greater activation in the

   compared to positive comments. These findings indicate that when given

   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, several of the
   foundational assumptions underpinning classic theories and frameworks in
   strategic management and entrepreneurship research are being called into
   question. Old models based on a simplistic left brain/right brain
   dichotomy are giving way to more sophisticated conceptions, in which
   intuitive and analytical approaches to decision making are underpinned
   by complex neuropsychological systems. In the light of these advances,
   the authors offer their reflections on what this all means for the
   assessment, development and management of intuition in the workplace.

Abstract = {{In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we compared
   young and older adults' brain activity as they thought about
   motivationally self-relevant agendas (hopes and aspirations, duties and
   obligations) and concrete control items (e.g.. shape of USA). Young
   adults' activity replicated a double dissociation (M. K. Johnson et al.,
   2006): An area of medial frontal gyrus/anterior cingulate cortex was
   most active during hopes and aspirations trials, and an area of medial
   posterior cortex-primarily posterior cingulate-was most active during
   duties and obligations trials. Compared with young adults, older adults
   showed attenuated response, in medial cortex, especially in medial
   prefrontal cortex, with both less activity during self-relevant trials
   and less deactivation during control trials. The fMRI data, together
   with post-scan reports and the behavioral literature on age-group
   differences in motivational orientation, suggest that the differences in
   medial cortex seen in this study reflect young and older adults' focus
   on different information during motivationally self-relevant thought,
   Differences also may be related to an age-associated deficit in
   controlled cognitive processes that are engaged by complex
   self-reflection and mediated by prefrontal cortex.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies have documented modulation of the activity of the
   amygdala - a key node in the neural network underlying emotion
   perception and processing, and one that has also been associated with
   regulating aggression - by exogenous testosterone. However, results on
   the impact of normal range testosterone levels on explicit emotion
   recognition as a prerequisite for social interaction and amygdala
   activation in healthy young mates are missing.
   Hence, we performed functional MRI at 3 T in a group of 21 healthy mates
   during explicit emotion recognition with a protocol specifically
   optimized to reliably detect amygdala activation. We observed similar
   amygdala activation to all emotions presented without any effect of
   gender of poser or Laterally. Reaction times to fearful mate faces were
   found negatively correlated to testosterone concentration, while no
   significant effects emerged for other emotions and neutral expressions.
   Correlation analyses revealed a significant positive association between
   testosterone levels and amygdala response to fearful and angry facial
   expressions, but not to other expressions. Hence, our results
   demonstrate that testosterone levels affect amygdala activation and also
   behavioral responses particularly to threat-related emotions in healthy
   young mates. We conclude that these findings add to our understanding of
   emotion processing and its modulation by neuroendocrine factors. (C)

Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Identifying another's mistakes requires a basic representation of
   other's action patterns as well as recognition and understanding of
   their failed goal-attainment. In previous work, we identified several
   regions, including inferior parietal cortex and rostral/ventral anterior
   cinguli (r/vACC), that show unique sensitivity to the observation of
   another's errors. Here we utilize the same sample to show that
   participants' level of self-reported perspective-taking (but not
   empathic concern) correlated with hemodynamic response in IPC, while
   participants' level of self-reported empathic concern (but not
   perspective taking) correlated with hemodynamic response in r/vACC. This
   functional dissociation provides strong evidence for separate roles for
   IPC and r/vACC in the processing of observed errors. IPC may foster a
   sense of agency by distinguishing self- from other-performed actions;
   r/vACC may, in turn, promote a more contextually-mediated understanding
   of the other's failed goal-attainment.}},

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Multiple lines of evidence implicate the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and
   the noradrenergic (norepinephrine, NE) system in responding to stressful
   stimuli such as fear signals, suggesting hyperfunction of both in the
   development of stress-related pathologies including anxiety disorders.
   However, no causative link between elevated NE neurotransmission and BLA
   hyperresponsiveness to fear signals has been established to date in
   humans. To determine whether or not increased noradrenergic tone
   enhances BLA responses to fear signals, we used functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) and a strategy of pharmacologically
   potentiating NE neurotransmission in healthy volunteers. 18 subjects
   were scanned two times on a facial emotion paradigm and given either a
   single-dose placebo or 4 mg of the selective NE reuptake inhibitor
   reboxetine 2 h prior to an fMRI session. We found that reboxetine
   induced an amygdala response bias towards fear signals that did not
   exist at placebo baseline. This pharmacological effect was
   probabilistically mapped to the BLA. Extrapolation of our data to
   conditions of traumatic stress suggests that disinhibited endogenous NE
   signaling could serve as a crucial etiological contributor to
   post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by eliciting exaggerated BLA
   responses to fear signals.}},

Abstract = {{Effective photojournalism provokes an emotional reaction and leaves a
   lasting impression upon the viewer. Striking and memorable images are
   often said to possess impact. Within cognitive neuroscience memorable
   emotional images evoke a greater amygdala response. Research to date has
   focused on arousal as a causative factor, while the contribution of
   appraisal dimensions relating to salience of an item, goal relevance, or
   impact are yet to be addressed. We explored how differences in ratings
   of impact influenced amygdala activity to negative emotional images
   matched for valence, arousal and other factors. Increased amygdala
   activation was found to high impact when compared to neutral images, or
   high impact when compared to low impact images (matched for arousal).
   Our findings demonstrate that the amygdala response to emotional stimuli
   is not a function of arousal (or valence) alone and accord more with the
   proposal that the amygdala responds to the significance or relevance of
   an event.}},

Abstract = {{Developmental research has demonstrated the harmful effects of peer
   rejection during adolescence; however, the neural mechanisms responsible
   for this salience remain unexplored. In this study, 23 adolescents were
   excluded during a ball-tossing game in which they believed they were
   playing with two other adolescents during an fMRI scan; in reality,
   participants played with a preset computer program. Afterwards,
   participants reported their exclusion-related distress and rejection
   sensitivity, and parents reported participants' interpersonal
   competence. Similar to findings in adults, during social exclusion
   adolescents displayed insular activity that was positively related to
   self-reported distress, and right ventrolateral prefrontal activity that
   was negatively related to self-reported distress. Findings unique to
   adolescents indicated that activity in the subgenual anterior cingulate
   cortex (subACC) related to greater distress, and that activity in the
   ventral striatum related to less distress and appeared to play a role in
   regulating activity in the subACC and other regions involved in
   emotional distress. Finally, adolescents with higher rejection
   sensitivity and interpersonal competence scores displayed greater neural
   evidence of emotional distress, and adolescents with higher
   interpersonal competence scores also displayed greater neural evidence
   of regulation, perhaps suggesting that adolescents who are vigilant
   regarding peer acceptance may be most sensitive to rejection
   experiences.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation for goal-directed behaviour largely depends on the expected
   value of the anticipated reward. The aim of the present study was to
   examine how different levels of reward value are coded in the brain for
   two common forms of human reward: money and social approval. To account
   for gender differences 16 male and 16 female participants performed an
   incentive delay task expecting to win either money or positive social
   feedback. fMRI recording during the anticipation phase revealed
   proportional activation of neural structures constituting the human
   reward system for increasing levels of reward, independent of incentive
   type. However, in men activation in the prospect of monetary rewards
   encompassed a wide network of mesolimbic brain regions compared to only
   limited activation for social rewards. In contrast, in women,
   anticipation of either incentive type activated identical brain regions.
   Our findings represent an important step towards a better understanding
   of motivated behaviour by taking into account individual differences in
   reward valuation.}},

Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{In this fMRI study, we investigated theory of mind (ToM) in patients
   with paranoid schizophrenia. We hypothesized that the network supporting
   the representation of intentions is dysfunctional in patients with
   schizophrenia dependent on the type of intention involved. We used a
   paradigm including a control condition (physical causation) and three
   intention conditions (private intention, prospective social intention
   and communicative intentions) differing in the degree of social
   interaction. In all four experimental conditions patients performed
   worse than controls regarding accuracy and reaction time. They showed
   significantly less activation in three regions typically activated in
   ToM tasks, i.e. paracingulate cortex and bilateral temporo-parietal
   junctions. However, this dysfunction was dependent on the type of
   intention represented, i.e. was present only for social but not for
   non-social intentions. Moreover, part of the reduced activation was
   related to the fact that there was no signal drop in these regions for
   the physical causality condition as usually found in controls. This may
   be due to the tendency of schizophrenic patients to attribute
   intentionality to physical objects. Our findings have implications for
   the study and understanding of ToM in schizophrenia but also in other
   disorders like autism.}},

Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{The ability to group stimuli into meaningful categories is fundamental
   to natural behavior. Raw perceptions would be useless without an ability
   to classify items as, for example, threat or food. Previous work
   suggests that people have a tendency to group stimuli either on the
   basis of a single dimension or by overall similarity (e.g., Milton,
   F.N., Longmore, C.A., and Wills, A.J. (2008). Processes of overall
   similarity sorting in free classification. J. Exp. Psychol. Hum.
   Percept. Perform, 34, 676-692.). It has recently been suggested that
   overall similarity sorting can engage similar rule-based processes to
   single-dimension sorting and, in addition, requires greater use of
   working memory (Milton, F.N., and Wills, A. J. (2004). The influences of
   stimulus properties on category construction. J. Exp. Psychol. Learn.
   Mem. Cogn, 30, 407-415.). These predictions were tested in an
   event-related fMRI study of spontaneous categorization. Results showed a
   striking overlap of activation between overall similarity and
   single-dimension sorting indicating engagement of common neural
   processes. Furthermore, overall similarity sorting recruited additional
   activity in bilateral precuneus, right cuneus, left cerebellum, left
   postcentral gyrus, right thalamus and right ventrolateral frontal cortex
   (VLFC). Our findings suggest that overall similarity sorting can be the
   result of rule-based processes and highlight a potential role for right
   VLFC in integrating multi-dimensional sensory information to form
   conceptual categories. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In an fMRI experiment, participants were exposed to narratives based on
   true stories designed to evoke admiration and compassion in 4 distinct
   categories: admiration for virtue (AV), admiration for skill (AS),
   compassion for social/psychological pain (CSP), and compassion for
   physical pain (CPP). The goal was to test hypotheses about recruitment
   of homeostatic, somatosensory, and consciousness-related neural systems
   during the processing of pain-related (compassion) and non-pain-related
   (admiration) social emotions along 2 dimensions: emotions about other
   peoples' social/psychological conditions (AV, CSP) and emotions about
   others' physical conditions (AS, CPP). Consistent with theoretical
   accounts, the experience of all 4 emotions engaged brain regions
   involved in interoceptive representation and homeostatic regulation,
   including anterior insula, anterior cingulate, hypothalamus, and
   mesencephalon. However, the study also revealed a previously undescribed
   pattern within the posteromedial cortices (the ensemble of precuneus,
   posterior cingulate cortex, and retrosplenial region), an intriguing
   territory currently known for its involvement in the default mode of
   brain operation and in self-related/consciousness processes: emotions
   pertaining to social/psychological and physical situations engaged
   different networks aligned, respectively, with interoceptive and
   exteroceptive neural systems. Finally, within the anterior insula,
   activity correlated with AV and CSP peaked later and was more sustained
   than that associated with CPP. Our findings contribute insights on the
   functions of the posteromedial cortices and on the recruitment of the
   anterior insula in social emotions concerned with physical versus
   psychological pain.}},

Abstract = {{Bimodal bilinguals are hearing individuals who know both a signed and a
   spoken language. Effects of bimodal bilingualism on behavior and brain
   organization are reviewed, and an fMRI investigation of the recognition
   of facial expressions by ASL-English bilinguals is reported. The fMRI
   results reveal separate effects of sign language and spoken language
   experience on activation patterns within the superior temporal sulcus.
   In addition, the strong left-lateralized activation for facial
   expression recognition previously observed for deaf signers was not
   observed for hearing signers. We conclude that both sign language
   experience and deafness can affect the neural organization for
   recognizing facial expressions, and we argue that bimodal bilinguals
   provide a unique window into the neurocognitive changes that occur with
   the acquisition of two languages. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{In an everyday social interaction we automatically integrate another's
   facial movements and vocalizations, be they linguistic or otherwise.
   This requires audiovisual integration of a continual barrage of sensory
   input-a phenomenon previously well-studied with human audiovisual
   speech, but not with non-verbal vocalizations. Using both fMRI and ERPs,
   we assessed neural activity to viewing and listening to an animated
   female face producing non-verbal, human vocalizations (i.e. coughing,
   sneezing) under audio-only (AUD), visual-only (VIS) and audiovisual (AV)
   stimulus conditions, alternating with Rest (R). Underadditive effects
   occurred in regions dominant for sensory processing, which showed AV
   activation greater than the dominant modality alone. Right posterior
   temporal and parietal regions showed an AV maximum in which AV
   activation was greater than either modality alone, but not greater than
   the sum of the unisensory conditions. Other frontal and parietal regions
   showed Common-activation in which AV activation was the same as one or
   both unisensory conditions. ERP data showed an early superadditive
   effect (AV > AUD + VIS, no rest), mid-range underadditive effects for
   auditory N140 and face-sensitive N170, and late AV maximum and
   common-activation effects. Based on convergence between fMRI and ERP
   data, we propose a mechanism where a multisensory stimulus may be
   signaled or facilitated as early as 60 ms and facilitated in
   sensory-specific regions by increasing processing speed (at N170) and
   efficiency (decreasing amplitude in auditory and face-sensitive cortical
   activation and ERPs). Finally, higher-order processes are also altered,
   but in a more complex fashion.}},

Abstract = {{Confronted with a rich sensory environment, the brain must learn
   statistical regularities across sensory domains to construct causal
   models of the world. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging
   and dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to furnish neurophysiological evidence
   that statistical associations are learnt, even when task-irrelevant.
   Subjects performed an audio-visual target-detection task while being
   exposed to distractor stimuli. Unknown to them, auditory distractors
   predicted the presence or absence of subsequent visual distractors. We
   modeled incidental learning of these associations using a
   Rescorla-Wagner (RW) model. Activity in primary visual cortex and
   putamen reflected learning-dependent surprise: these areas responded
   progressively more to unpredicted, and progressively less to predicted
   visual stimuli. Critically, this prediction-error response was observed
   even when the absence of a visual stimulus was surprising. We
   investigated the underlying mechanism by embedding the RW model into a
   DCM to show that auditory to visual connectivity changed significantly
   over time as a function of prediction error. Thus, consistent with
   predictive coding models of perception, associative learning is mediated
   by prediction-error dependent changes in connectivity. These results
   posit a dual role for prediction-error in encoding surprise and driving
   associative plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Substantial experimental evidence Supports the theory that the
   dopaminergic system codes a phasic (short duration) signal predicting
   the delivery of primary reinforcers, such as water when thirsty, during
   Pavlovian learning. This signal is described by the temporal difference
   (TD) model. Recently, it has been suggested that the human dopaminergic
   system also codes more complex cognitive goal states, including those
   required for human social interaction. Using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) with 18 healthy subjects, we tested the
   hypothesis that TD signals would be present during a Pavlovian learning
   task, and during a social motor response learning task. Using an
   identical model, TD signals were present in both tasks, although in
   different brain regions. Specifically, signals were present in the
   dorsal anterior cingulate, ventral striatum, amygdala, and thalamus with
   Pavlovian learning, and the dorsal anterior cingulate and bilateral
   frontal operculum with social motor response learning. The frontal
   operculum is believed to be the human homologue of the monkey mirror
   neuron system, and there is evidence which links the region with
   inference about other peoples' intentions and goals. The results support
   the contention that the human dopaminergic system predicts both primary
   reinforcers, and more complex cognitive goal states, such as motor
   responses required for human social group interaction. Dysfunction of
   such a mechanism might be associated with abnormal affective responses
   and incorrect social predictions, as Occur in psychiatric disorders. Hum
