Abstract = {{Huntington's disease is characterized by corticostriatal dysfunction and
   degeneration of the striatum with progressive loss of the medium spiny
   neurons These circuits are important for instrumental responding,
   interval timing, and temporal control over motor output. We investigated
   the acquisition of timed operant responding in two R6/2 Huntington's
   Disease models, differing in CAG repeat length and genetic background
   (115 and 250 CAG repeats, and a mixed CBAxC57 or pure C57 background)
   and their corresponding wild type controls using the peak procedure Both
   mouse lines exhibited similar response control deficits. In unreinforced
   peak trials, mice either did not learn to terminate an ongoing response
   past reinforcement time or required more trials to acquisition compared
   to the wild type mice While transgenic and wild type mice did not
   exhibit differences in temporal accuracy, response curves were flatter
   in transgenic mice, suggesting decreased temporal control over operant
   responding. The results are discussed in terms of the neurobiology of
   interval timing, instrumental responding, and the neuropathology of HD
   and R6/2 mice}},

Abstract = {{Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated neural
   activity associated with self-reflection in depressed {[}current major
   depressive episode (MDE)] and healthy control participants, focusing on
   medial cortex areas previously shown to be associated with
   self-reflection. Both the MDE and healthy control groups showed greater
   activity in anterior medial cortex (medial frontal gyrus, anterior
   cingulate gyrus) when cued to think about hopes and aspirations compared
   with duties and obligations, and greater activity in posterior medial
   cortex (precuneus, posterior cingulate) when cued to think about duties
   and obligations (Experiment 1). However, the MDE group showed less
   activity than controls in the same area of medial frontal cortex when
   self-referential cues were more ambiguous with respect to valence
   (Experiment 2), and less deactivation in a non-self-referential
   condition in both experiments. Furthermore, individual differences in
   rumination were positively correlated with activity in both anterior and
   posterior medial cortex during non-self-referential conditions. These
   results provide converging evidence for a dissociation of anterior and
   posterior medial cortex depending on the focus of self-relevant thought.
   They also provide neural evidence consistent with behavioral findings
   that depression is associated with disruption of positively valenced
   thoughts in response to ambiguous cues, and difficulty disengaging from
   self-reflection when it is appropriate to do so.}},

Abstract = {{Sex differences in brain structure have been examined extensively but
   are not completely understood, especially in relation to possible
   functional correlates. Our two aims in this study were to investigate
   sex differences in brain structure, and to investigate a possible
   relation between orbitofrontal cortex subregions and affective
   individual differences. We used tensor-based morphometry to estimate
   local brain volume from MPRAGE images in 117 healthy right-handed adults
   (58 female), age 18-40 years. We entered estimates of local brain volume
   as the dependent variable in a GLM, controlling for age, intelligence
   and whole-brain volume. Men had larger left planum temporale. Women had
   larger ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), right lateral
   orbitofrontal (rlOFC), cerebellum, and bilateral basal ganglia and
   nearby white matter. vmPFC but not rlOFC volume covaried with
   self-reported emotion regulation strategies (reappraisal, suppression),
   expressivity of positive emotions (but not of negative), strength of
   emotional impulses, and cognitive but not somatic anxiety. vmPFC volume
   statistically mediated sex differences in emotion suppression. The
   results confirm prior reports of sex differences in orbitofrontal cortex
   structure, and are the first to show that normal variation in vmPFC
   volume is systematically related to emotion regulation and affective
   individual differences.}},

   for emotional as compared to neutral stimuli. We found significantly
   reduced EPN values for the ADHD patients compared to the healthy
   controls, but only in the positive stimuli condition, without any
   significant differences in the negative stimuli condition. Our data
   indicate that ADHD patients show less reactivity to positive visual
   stimuli which might be relevant in the context of described dysfunctions

Abstract = {{Some people love taking risks, while others avoid gambles at all costs.
   The neural mechanisms underlying individual variation in preference for
   risky or certain outcomes, however, remain poorly understood. Although
   behavioral pathologies associated with compulsive gambling, addiction
   and other psychiatric disorders implicate deficient serotonin signaling
   in pathological decision making, there is little experimental evidence
   demonstrating a link between serotonin and risky decision making, in
   part due to the lack of a good animal model. We used dietary rapid
   tryptophan depletion (RTD) to acutely lower brain serotonin in three
   macaques performing a simple gambling task for fluid rewards. To confirm
   the efficacy of RTD experiments, we measured total plasma tryptophan
   using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical
   detection. Reducing brain serotonin synthesis decreased preference for
   the safe option in a gambling task. Moreover, lowering brain serotonin
   function significantly decreased the premium required for monkeys to
   switch their preference to the risky option, suggesting that diminished
   serotonin signaling enhances the relative subjective value of the risky
   option. These results implicate serotonin in risk-sensitive decision
   making and, further, suggest pharmacological therapies for treating
   pathological risk preferences in disorders such as problem gambling and
   addiction.}},

Abstract = {{Serotonin is a key neurotransmitter involved in emotional regulation and
   memory. A number of studies using acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) in
   healthy subjects have shown that a temporary serotonin reduction both
   induces a negative emotional bias and impairs long-term memory. However,
   little is known about the specific effects of ATD on emotional memory.
   Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated the
   effect of ATD on negative memory and executive function in healthy
   volunteers. Our emotional oddball task required participants to
   distinguish infrequently presented targets from distracting negative and
   neutral pictures. Memory for the distracting pictures was tested 1 h
   following the fMRI session. ATD selectively enhanced memory for negative
   distractors relative to neutral distractors and increased activation in
   response to the negative distractors in the left orbital-inferior
   frontal, dorsomedial prefrontal and bilateral angular gyri. ATD also
   induced greater activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus and
   anterior cingulate across all stimuli. Stronger frontal activation to
   distractors was positively correlated with memory performance on ATD but
   not control days, indicating a possible compensatory mechanism for
   coping with increased task demand under the ATD challenge. These
   findings highlight the importance of serotonin in negative memory with
   implications for mood disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Observers were scanned while they watched a video of an actor using an
   object. Three conditions were contrasted in which the same object was
   used: (i) normally (e.g. using a tennis racket to hit a ball), (ii) in
   an unusual way (e.g. using a tennis racket to strain spaghetti), (iii)
   in a pretend play (e.g. playing a tennis racket like a banjo). Observing
   real and unusual uses of objects activated areas previously seen in
   studies of tool use including areas associated with a mirror system for
   action. Observing pretend play activated additional areas previously
   associated with theory of mind tasks and listening to narrative,
   including medial prefrontal cortex, posterior superior temporal sulcus
   and temporal poles. After presentation of each video, observers were
   asked to name the object as used in the preceding action video (e.g.
   racket, sieve or banjo). Naming the pretend object elicited activity in
   medial prefrontal cortex. These results are consistent with proposals
   that pretend play is a form of communicative narrative, associated with
   the ability to mentalize. However, this leaves open the question as to
   whether pretence or mentalizing is the more basic process.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has implicated regions of anterior insula/frontal
   operculum in processing conspecific facial expressions of disgust. It
   has been suggested however that there are a variety of disgust facial
   expression components which relate to the disgust-eliciting stimulus.
   The nose wrinkle is predominantly associated with irritating or
   offensive smells, the mouth gape and tongue extrusion with distaste and
   oral irritation, while a broader range of disgust elicitors including
   aversive interpersonal contacts and certain moral offenses are
   associated primarily with the upper lip curl. Using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging, we show that activity in the anterior insula/frontal
   operculum is seen only in response to canonical disgust faces,
   exhibiting the nose wrinkle and upper lip curl, and not in response to
   distaste facial expressions, exhibiting a mouth gape and tongue
   protrusion. Canonical disgust expressions also result in activity in
   brain regions linked to social cognition more broadly, including dorsal
   medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, temporo-parietal
   junction and superior temporal sulcus. We interpret these differences in
   relation to the relative functional and communicative roles of the
   different disgust expressions and suggest a significant role for
   appraisal processes in the insula activation to facial expressions of
   disgust.}},

Abstract = {{Our knowledge on the development of the affective and cognitive
   circuitries that underlie affect regulation is still limited. This
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study examined whether
   there is more efficient prefrontal modulation of affective circuits with
   development. Ten adolescents (mean age 14 +/- 2 years) and 10 adults
   (mean age 30 +/- 6 years) underwent two scanning conditions that
   required different levels of cognitive control over face emotion
   processing. A `directed' emotion processing condition required judgment
   of facial expressions. An `incidental' emotion processing condition
   required an age judgment. For the incidental emotion processing
   condition, adolescents, compared with adults, showed less activation in
   right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and greater activation in
   paralimbic regions, suggesting greater emotional reactivity and immature
   prefrontal circuitries for affect regulation. For the directed emotion
   processing condition, adolescents, compared with adults, showed
   decreased recruitment of both the dorsal and pregenual right anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC), suggesting immature modulatory functions of the
   ACC during directed face emotion processing. These results indicate that
   the neural circuitries for affect regulation are still developing in
   adolescence and have not yet reached the adult level.}},

Abstract = {{Serotonin (5-HT) modulates emotional and cognitive functions such as
   fear conditioning (FC) and decision making. This study investigated the
   effects of a functional polymorphism in the regulatory region (5-HTTLPR)
   of the human 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) gene on observational FC, risk
   taking and susceptibility to framing in decision making under
   uncertainty, as well as multidimensional anxiety and autonomic control
   of the heart in healthy volunteers. The present results indicate that in
   comparison to the homozygotes for the long (l) version of 5-HTTLPR, the
   carriers of the short (s) version display enhanced observational FC,
   reduced financial risk taking and increased susceptibility to framing in
   economic decision making. We also found that s-carriers have increased
   trait anxiety due to threat in social evaluation, and ambiguous threat
   perception. In addition, s-carriers also show reduced autonomic control
   over the heart, and a pattern of reduced vagal tone and increased
   sympathetic activity in comparison to l-homozygotes. This is the first
   genetic study that identifies the association of a functional
   polymorphism in a key neurotransmitter-related gene with complex
   social-emotional and cognitive processes. The present set of results
   suggests an endophenotype of anxiety disorders, characterized by
   enhanced social learning of fear, impaired decision making and
   dysfunctional autonomic activity.}},

Abstract = {{A reward or punishment can seem better or worse depending on what else
   might have happened. Little is known, however, about how neural
   representations of an anticipated incentive might be influenced by the
   available alternatives. We used event-related FMRI to investigate the
   activation in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), while we varied the
   available alternative incentives in a monetary incentive delay task.
   Some task blocks included only uncertain gains and losses; others
   included the same uncertain gains and losses intermixed with certain
   gains and losses. The availability of certain gains and losses increased
   NAcc activation for uncertain losses and decreased the difference
   between uncertain gains and losses. We suggest that this pattern of
   activation can result from reference point changes across blocks, and
   that the worst available loss may serve as an important anchor for NAcc
   activation. These findings imply that NAcc activation represents
   anticipated incentive value relative to the current context of available
   alternative gains and losses.}},

Abstract = {{An incredible amount of data is generated in the course of a functional
   neuroimaging experiment. The quantity of data gives us improved temporal
   and spatial resolution with which to evaluate our results. It also
   creates a staggering multiple testing problem. A number of methods have
   been created that address the multiple testing problem in neuroimaging
   in a principled fashion. These methods place limits on either the
   familywise error rate (FWER) or the false discovery rate (FDR) of the
   results. These principled approaches are well established in the
   literature and are known to properly limit the amount of false positives
   across the whole brain. However, a minority of papers are still
   published every month using methods that are improperly corrected for
   the number of tests conducted. These latter methods place limits on the
   voxelwise probability of a false positive and yield no information on
   the global rate of false positives in the results. In this commentary,
   we argue in favor of a principled approach to the multiple testing
   problem-one that places appropriate limits on the rate of false
   positives across the whole brain gives readers the information they need
   to properly evaluate the results.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical thresholding (i.e. P-values) in fMRI research has become
   increasingly conservative over the past decade in an attempt to diminish
   Type I errors (i.e. false alarms) to a level traditionally allowed in
   behavioral science research. In this article, we examine the unintended
   negative consequences of this single-minded devotion to Type I errors:
   increased Type II errors (i.e. missing true effects), a bias toward
   studying large rather than small effects, a bias toward observing
   sensory and motor processes rather than complex cognitive and affective
   processes and deficient meta-analyses. Power analyses indicate that the
   reductions in acceptable P-values over time are producing dramatic
   increases in the Type II error rate. Moreover, the push for a mapwide
   false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 is based on the assumption that this
   is the FDR in most behavioral research; however, this is an inaccurate
   assessment of the conventions in actual behavioral research. We report
   simulations demonstrating that combined intensity and cluster size
   thresholds such as P < 0.005 with a 10 voxel extent produce a desirable
   balance between Types I and II error rates. This joint threshold
   produces high but acceptable Type II error rates and produces a FDR that
   is comparable to the effective FDR in typical behavioral science
   articles (while a 20 voxel extent threshold produces an actual FDR of
   0.05 with relatively common imaging parameters). We recommend a greater
   focus on replication and meta-analysis rather than emphasizing single
   studies as the unit of analysis for establishing scientific truth. From
   this perspective, Type I errors are self-erasing because they will not
   replicate, thus allowing for more lenient thresholding to avoid Type II
   errors.}},

Abstract = {{Animals and humans are able to predict and synchronize their daily
   activity to signals present in their environments. Environmental cues
   are most often associated with signaling the beginning or the end of a
   daily activity cycle, but they can also be used to time the presentation
   or availability of scarce resources. If the signal occurs consistently,
   animals can begin to anticipate its arrival and ultimately become
   entrained to its presence. While many stimuli can produce anticipation
   for a daily event, these events rarely lead to changes in activity
   patterns during the rest of the circadian cycle. Here the authors
   demonstrate that performance of a task requiring sustained attention not
   only produces entrainment, but produces a robust modification in the
   animals' activity throughout the entire circadian cycle. In particular,
   normally nocturnal rats, when trained during the light phase (ZT 4)
   adopted a significant and reversible diurnal activity pattern. Of
   importance, control experiments demonstrated that this entrainment could
   not be attributed to the noncognitive components of task performance,
   such as handling, water deprivation, access to water used as a reward,
   or animal activity associated with operant training. These findings
   additionally indicate that levels of cognitive performance are modulated
   by the circadian cycle and that such activity can act as a highly
   effective entrainment signal. These results form the basis for future
   research on the role of neuronal systems mediating interactions between
   cognitive activity and circadian rhythms.}},

Abstract = {{Although it has often been speculated that prior reproductive experience
   improves subsequent maternal care, few studies have examined specific
   changes in behavior during a 1st versus 2nd lactation. During lactation,
   mothers display heightened aggression toward male intruders, purportedly
   to protect vulnerable young. In the current study, maternal aggression
   was examined in primiparous and age-matched multiparous females on
   postpartum days 5 (PPD5) and PPD15. Expression of oxytocin, oxytocin
   receptor, arginine vasopressin, arginine vasopressin Via receptors, and
   corticotrophin-releasing hormone mRNA was measured following aggression
   testing at both time points using real-time quantitative PCR in brain
   regions previously implicated in the regulation of maternal aggression.
   Multiparity significantly enhanced maternal aggression on PPD5 but not
   on PPD15. In addition, this increased aggression was associated with
   region- and gene-specific changes in mRNA expression. These findings
   indicate that reproductive experience enhances maternal aggression, an
   effect that may be mediated by region-specific alterations in
   neuropeptidergic activity. The adaptations observed in multiparous
   females provide an innate model for the study of neuroplasticity in the
   regulation of aggression.}},

Abstract = {{Sex steroids play a significant role in organizing male social behavior,
   which is associated with low levels of pro-social behavior and high
   levels of aggression. However, the role of steroids in organizing
   behavior in highly social males is unclear. The authors tested the
   hypothesis that low levels of sex steroids facilitate the expression of
   pro-social behavior in male prairie voles (Microtus ochragaster),
   predicting that inhibition of testosterone and estradiol would reduce
   spontaneous-alloparental behavior. Treatment with the aromatase
   inhibitor 1,4,6-androstatriene-3,17-dione (ATD) or the androgen receptor
   blocker flutamide, days 8-14, significantly reduced the expression of
   alloparental behavior in 21-day old males. While both treatments reduced
   alloparental behavior and increased pup-directed aggression, there were
   differential treatment effects. Flutamide altered initial response,
   increasing latency to enter the pup cage and the likelihood of retreat
   from initial contact. ATD-treated males that were alloparental showed
   increases in sniffing and latencies to lick and huddle. Results indicate
   that endogenous steroids play a role in the development of male
   pro-social behavior and the effects of estrogens and androgens differ.}},

Abstract = {{The present study examined odorant communication during acute illness
   provoked by injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 mu g/kg) and how
   these effects vary between prepubertal and adult conspecifics. Exposure
   to odor of LPS-treated adult male rats produced increased avoidance in
   both sexes of adults and prepubertal male partners. This response was
   not found when they were exposed to odor of LPS-treated prepubertal
   males. Even a 2.5-fold higher load of LPS in prepubertal males failed to
   produce aversive odor cues, suggesting that the difference in the odor
   is not a simple issue of dose/body volume. Both estradiol benzoate (20
   mu g/kg) and testosterone propionate (500 mu g/kg), but not
   dihydrotestosterone (500 mu g/kg) pretreatment in prepubertal males
   administered LPS restored the expression of aversive odor. These hormone
   treatments per se did not influence odor properties of prepubertal
   males, indicating that estrogen receptors may play a key regulatory role
   in the expression of aversive odor in LPS-treated prepubertal rats.
   These data suggest that the expression of sickness-related odor emerges
   through puberty, and likely involves a complex interaction between
   inflammation and sex steroids across development.}},

Abstract = {{Male rats display a conditioned preference to ejaculate with a female

   flupenthixol prior to 10 conditioning trials in a pacing chamber with an
   almond-scented female. On the final test, all males were injected with
   saline and given access to 2 females, 1 scented and the other unscented,
   in an open field. Only males injected with naloxone during training
   failed to manifest a conditioned ejaculatory preference. These findings
   suggest that activation of opioid, but not dopamine, systems during
   sexual interaction are necessary for conditioned ejaculatory preference

Abstract = {{The nature and extent of deficiencies in bimanual motor coordination in
   individuals with agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) was studied using
   the computerized Bimanual Coordination Test (cBCT). Compared with
   previous bimanual tasks, the cBCT is more specifically reliant on
   interhemispheric interactions of lateralized motor control, allows more
   precise measurement, and permits examination of performance over a wider
   range of bimanual challenges. The cBCT performance of 13
   high-functioning individuals with complete ACC was compared to 21 age-
   and IQ-matched controls. The groups did not differ in unimanual response
   speed. On trials involving angled paths that require bimanual
   coordination, the ACC group performed significantly slower and less
   accurately across all angles. The largest group differences in speed
   occurred on trials where the hands must respond symmetrically, while
   mirror-image (vs. parallel) responding produced the greatest deficits in
   accuracy. These data confirm previous findings of deficits in bimanual
   coordination in callosal absence, but using significantly improved
   measurement technology. Deficits in bimanual coordination in ACC are
   present across different demands for interhand interactions in the speed
   and direction of movement.}},

Abstract = {{Local availability of glycine near N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors
   (NMDARs) is partly regulated by neuronal glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1),
   which can therefore modulate NMDAR function because binding to the
   glycine site of the NMDAR is necessary for channel activation.
   Disrupting GlyT1 in forebrain neurons has been shown to enhance
   Pavlovian conditioning and object recognition memory. Here, the authors
   report that the same genetic manipulation facilitated reversal learning
   in the water maze test of reference memory, but did not lead to any
   clear improvement in a working memory version of the water maze test.
   Facilitation in a nonspatial discrimination reversal task conducted on a
   T maze was also observed, supporting the conclusion that forebrain
   neuronal GlyT1 may modulate the flexibility in (new) learning and
   relevant mnemonic functions. One possibility is that these phenotypes
   may reflect reduced susceptibility to certain forms of proactive
   interference. This may be relevant for the suggested clinical
   application of GlyT1 inhibitors in the treatment of cognitive deficits,
   including schizophrenia, which is characterized by cognitive
   inflexibility in addition to the positive symptoms of the disease.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term cognitive impairments are a feared consequence of therapeutic
   cranial irradiation in children as well as adults. Studies in animal
   models suggest that these deficits may be associated with a decrease in
   hippocampal granule cell proliferation and survival. In the present
   study the authors examined whether whole brain irradiation would affect
   trace fear conditioning, a hippocampal-dependent task. Preadolescent
   (postnatal Day 21, PD 21), adolescent (PD 50), and postadolescent (PD
   70) rats received single doses of 0 Gray (Gy), 0.3 Gy, 3 Gy, or 10 Gy
   whole brain irradiation. Three months after radiation treatment, a
   significant dose-dependent decrease in bromo-deoxyuridine positive cells
   was observed. Irradiation produced a dose-dependent decrease in freezing
   in response to the conditioned stimulus in all age groups.
   Interestingly, the authors found no differences in context freezing
   between irradiated and control groups. Further, there were no
   differences in delay fear memories, which are independent of hippocampus
   function. Our results strongly indicate that irradiation impairs
   associative memories dependent on hippocampus and this deficit is
   accompanied by a decrease in granule cell neurogenesis indicating that
   these cells may be involved in normal hippocampal memory function.}},

   l/side), the 5-HT6 receptor agonist EMD 386088 (at 0.0, 1.0, and 4.0 mu
   g/0.5 mu l/side), or the 5-HT2C preferential agonist RO 60-0175 (at 0.0,
   2.0, or 5.0 mu g/0.5 mu l/side) on food intake and locomotor activity in
   the rat. Intra-accumbens infusions of 5-CT caused a dose-dependent
   reduction of food intake and rearing behavior, both in food-restricted
   animals given 2-hr free access to Purina Protab RMH 3000 Chow, as well
   as in nondeprived rats offered 2-hr access to a highly palatable
   fat/sucrose diet. In contrast, stimulation of 5-HT6 receptors with EMD
   386088 caused a dose-dependent increase of intake under both feeding
   conditions, without affecting measures of locomotion. Infusions of the
   moderately selective 5-HT2C receptor agonist RO 60-0175 had no effects
   on feeding or locomotor measures in food-restricted animals, but did
   reduce intake of the fat/sucrose in nonrestricted animals at the 2.0 mu
   g, but not the 5.0 mu g dose. Intra-accumbens infusions of selective
   antagonists for the 5-HT7 (SB 269970), 5-HT6 (SB 252585), and 5-HT2C (RS
   102221) receptors did not affect locomotion, and demonstrated no lasting
   changes in feeding for any of the groups tested. These data are the
   first to suggest that the activation of different serotonin receptor
   subtypes within the feeding circuitry of the medial nucleus accumbens
   differentially influence consummatory behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The orexigenic neuropeptide ghrelin is an endogeneous ligand for the
   growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R). This orexigen is expressed
   in both the periphery and in the central system, including portions of
   mesolimbic dopaminergic circuitry that play a role in affective
   behaviors. Here we examined pharmacological antagonism of GHS-R in
   motivational incentive learning, as reflected in
   Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (PIT). Furthermore, it is currently
   unclear whether the previous effects of ghrelin on food intake are
   mediated by pre- and/or postingestive influences on ingestive behavior.
   Thus, the authors also conducted detailed analyses of the temporal
   dynamics of sucrose licking. Mice received low (50 nmol), moderate (100
   nmol), and high (200 nmol) intraperitoneal injections of the GHS-R
   antagonist GHRP-6 {[}D-Lys3] prior to subsequent transfer and sucrose
   consumption tests. Low and moderate doses led to an augmentation of PIT,
   while high dose injections led to generalized performance deficits. In
   addition, moderate and high doses of the antagonist resulted in
   reductions in sucrose intake by reducing palatability of the sucrose.
   These results suggest dissociable functions of GHS-R in its influence
   over motivational learning and ingestive behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The current study investigated the effects of cold pressor stress (CPS)
   on 2 working memory (WM) tasks differing in the demand they put on
   maintenance and executive processing. For this purpose 72 healthy young
   men were exposed either to a stress group or a nonstressful control
   group. Subsequently, WM performance on the O-Span task (Turner \& Engle,
   1989) and the digit span task was assessed. Salivary cortisol was
   measured before and 2 times after the treatment as a marker of
   hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity. Results revealed a
   significant performance impairment of the O-Span and the digit span task
   backward in stressed subjects that correlated negatively with
   CPS-induced cortisol increases. Digit span forward was neither affected
   by CPS nor related to the ensuing cortisol increases. These results
   indicate that acute stress impairs WM performance for task requiring
   executive functions that operate on the stored material but not for WM
   tasks that only require maintenance.}},

Abstract = {{3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a drug of abuse worldwide
   and a selective serotonin (5-HT) neurotoxin. An important factor in the
   risk of drug abuse and relapse is stress. Although multiple parallels
   exist between MDMA abuse and stress, including effects on 5-HTergic
   neurotransmission, few studies have investigated the consequences of
   combined exposure to MDMA and chronic stress. Therefore, rats were
   pretreated with MDMA and exposed 7 days later to 10 days of mild chronic
   unpredictable stress (CUS). MDMA pretreatment was hypothesized to
   enhance the effects of CUS leading to enhanced 5-HT transporter (SERT)
   depletion in the hippocampus and increased anxiety and cognitive
   impairment. Whereas MDMA alone increased anxiety-like behavior on the
   elevated plus maze, CUS alone or in combination with MDMA pretreatment
   did not increase anxiety-like behavior. In contrast, MDMA pretreatment
   led to CUS-induced learning impairment in the Morris water maze but not
   an enhanced depletion of hippocampal SERT protein. These results show
   that prior exposure to MDMA leads to stress-induced impairments in
   learning behavior that is not otherwise observed with stress alone and
   appear unrelated to an enhanced depletion of SERT.}},

Abstract = {{The conditioned eyeblink response (CR) in rabbits is lateralized to the
   eye targeted by the unconditioned stimulus (US). However, a
   contralateral component has been reported during concurrent
   discriminative conditioning of the two eyes. The authors investigated
   CRs produced by both eyes during conditioning with 2 different
   interstimulus intervals (ISIs) in which a short conditioned stimulus
   (CS) was paired with a US to the left eye and a long CS was paired with
   a US to the right eye. Whether the 2 CSs were more or less similar (or
   identical), the short CS produced short-latency CRs in the left eye,
   whereas the long CS produced long-latency CRs in the right eye. The
   contralateral responses to a CS trained at one ISI were separable into
   temporal corollaries of the ipsilateral response (suggesting a
   bilaterality of the CR) versus those to a CS trained at another ISI
   (indicating generalization between the CSs). The results indicate that
   the neuronal substrates subserving CRs of the two eyes involve not only
   a dominant lateralization but also some avenue of bilaterality.}},

Abstract = {{The present experiment characterized conditioned nictitating membrane
   (NM) movements as a function of CS duration, using the full range of
   discernible movements (>.06 mm) rather than movements exceeding a
   conventional criterion (>.50 mm). The CS-US interval was fixed at 500
   ins, while across groups, the duration of the CS was 50 ms (trace), 550
   ms (delay), or 1050 ins (extended delay). The delay group showed the
   highest level of acquisition. When tested with the different CS
   durations, the delay and extended delay groups showed large reductions
   in their responses when their CS was shortened to 50 ins, but the trace
   group maintained its response at all durations. Timing of the
   conditioned movements appeared similar across all manipulations. The
   results suggest that the CS has both a fine timing function tied to CS
   onset and a general predictive function tied to CS duration, both of
   which may be mediated by cerebellar pathways.}},

Abstract = {{In many species, interval timing behavior is accurate-appropriate
   estimated durations-and scalar-errors vary linearly with estimated
   durations. Whereas accuracy has been previously examined, scalar timing
   has not been clearly demonstrated in house mice (Mus musculus), raising
   concerns about mouse models of human disease. The authors estimated
   timing accuracy and precision in C57BL/6 mice, the most used background
   strain for genetic models of human disease, in a peak-interval procedure
   with multiple intervals. Both when timing 2 intervals (Experiment 1) or
   3 intervals (Experiment 2), C57BL/6 mice demonstrated varying degrees of
   timing accuracy. An important finding was that, both at the individual
   and group levels, their precision varied linearly with the subjective
   estimated duration. Further evidence for scalar timing was obtained
   using an intraclass correlation statistic. This is the first report of
   consistent, reliable scalar timing in a sizable sample of house mice,
   thus validating the peak-interval procedure as a valuable technique, the
   intraclass correlation statistic as a powerful test of the scalar
   property, and the C57BL/6 strain as a suitable background for behavioral
   investigations of genetically engineered mice modeling disorders of
   interval timing.}},

Abstract = {{The synaptic Ras/Rap-GTPase-activating protein (SynGAP) regulates
   specific intracellular events following N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor
   (NMDAR) activation. Here, the impact of SynGAP heterozygous knockout
   (SG(+/-)) on NMDAR-dependent functions was assessed using different
   positive reinforcement schedules in instrumental conditioning. The
   knockout did not affect the temporal control of operant responding under
   a fixed interval (FI) schedule, but led to a putative enhancement in
   response vigor and/or disinhibition. When examined on differential
   reinforcement of low rates of response (DRL) schedules, SG(+/-) mice
   showed increased responding under DRL-4s and DRL-8s, without impairing
   the response efficiency (total rewards/total lever presses) because both
   rewarded and nonrewarded presses were elevated. Motivation was
   unaffected as evaluated using a progressive ratio (PR) schedule. Yet,
   SG(+/-) mice persisted in responding during extinction at the end of PR
   training, although an equivalent phenotype was not evident in extinction
   learning following FI-20s training. This extinction phenotype is
   therefore schedule-specific and cannot be generalized to Pavlovian
   conditioning. In conclusion, constitutive SynGAP reduction increases
   vigor in the execution of learned operant behavior without compromising
   its temporal control, yielding effects readily distinguishable from
   NMDAR blockade.}},

Abstract = {{The authors have recently demonstrated that the high serum estradiol
   level during the proestrus phase of the estrous cycle and that the
   administration of estradiol or progesterone in ovariectomized female and
   of testosterone in orchiectomized male rats significantly decrease
   formalin-induced temporomandibular joint (TMJ) nociception. In this
   study, the authors investigate the contribution of endogenous opioids to
   this antinociceptive effect of gonadal hormones in the TMJ formalin
   test. The opioid receptor antagonist naloxone was administrated either
   in the surrounding of the trigeminal sensory complex or in the TMJ
   region. The antinociceptive effect induced by endogenous estradiol in
   proestrus females and by exogenous estradiol in ovariectomized females
   was blocked by the administration of naloxone in the surrounding of the
   trigeminal sensory complex, but not in the TMJ region. The
   antinociceptive effect induced by the administration of progesterone in
   ovariectomized females and of testosterone in orchiectomized males was
   blocked by the administration of naloxone either in the surrounding of
   the trigeminal sensory complex or in the TMJ region. The authors
   conclude that central and peripheral opioid mechanisms mediate the
   antinociceptive effect of progesterone and testosterone, and central
   opioid mechanisms mediate the antinociceptive effect of estradiol. These
   findings suggest that the enhanced pain perception during low gonadal
   hormone periods in women and animals may be mediated by a decrease in
   endogenous opioid activity. This suggestion helps explain the higher
   severity of some pain conditions, such as temporomandibular dysfunctions
   in women than in men, that have no hormonal fluctuations.}},

Volume = {{123}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the present study was to explore the lasting effects of a
   tactile sensitivity enhancement induced by spike insoles on the control
   of stance in the elderly. Healthy elderly subjects (n = 19, mean age =
   68.8) and young adults (n = 17, mean age = 24.3) were instructed to
   stand or to walk for 5 minutes with sandals equipped with spike insoles.
   Postural control was evaluated four times during unperturbed stance: (1)
   before putting on the sandals equipped with spike insoles, (2) 5 minutes
   after standing or walking with them, (3) immediately after placing thin,
   smooth, and flexible insoles (no spike insoles) into the sandals to
   avoid the cutaneous contact with the spikes, and (4) after a sitting
   rest of 5 minutes with the no spike insoles. Sway parameters such as
   surface area, mean speed and root mean square were recorded. The present
   results suggest that (1) whatever the session (i.e. standing or walking)
   and the population, the artificial sensory message elicited by the
   spikes improved postural sway and, (2) the elderly were particularly
   perturbed when the tactile sensitivity enhancement device was removed.
   Whatever the age, the enriched sensory context provided by this tactile
   sensitivity enhancement device led to a better postural control; its
   suppression entailed a reweighting of the plantar cutaneous information.
   The difficulty that the elderly had to adjust the relative contribution
   of the different inputs probably reflected their poorer central
   integrative mechanisms for the reconfiguration of the postural set. A
   reduced peripheral sensitivity may also explain these postural deficits.}},

Abstract = {{Although contextual fear conditioning emerges later in development than
   explicit-cue fear conditioning, little is known about the stimulus
   parameters and biological substrates required at early ages. The authors
   adapted methods for investigating hippocampus function in adult rodents
   to identify determinants of contextual fear conditioning in developing
   rats. Experiment 1 examined the duration of exposure required by
   weanling rats at postnatal day (PND) 23 to demonstrate contextual fear
   conditioning. This experiment demonstrated that 30 s of context exposure
   is sufficient to support conditioning. Furthermore, preexposure enhanced
   conditioning to an immediate footshock, the context preexposure
   facilitation effect (CPFE), but had no effect on contextual conditioning
   to a delayed shock. Experiment 2 demonstrated that N-methyl-D-aspartate
   (NMDA) receptor inactivation during preexposure impairs contextual
   learning at PND 23. Thus, the conjuctive representations underlying the
   CPFE are NMDA-dependent as early as PND23 in the rat.}},

Abstract = {{Though the functional neural correlates of impaired cognitive control
   and social dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have been
   delineated, brain regions implicated in poor cognitive control of social
   information is a novel area of autism research. We recently reported in
   a non-clinical sample that detection of `social oddball' targets
   activated a portion of the dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus and the
   supracalcarine cortex (Dichter, Felder, Bodfish, Sikich, and Belger,
   2009). In the present investigation, we report functional magnetic
   resonance imaging results from individuals with ASD who completed the
   same social oddball task. Between-group comparisons revealed generally
   greater activation in the ASD group to both social and non-social
   targets. When responses to social and non-social targets were
   contrasted, the ASD group showed relatively greater activation in the
   right and middle inferior frontal gyri and a region in dorsomedial
   prefrontal cortex that abuts the dorsal anterior cingulate (Brodmann's
   Area 32). Further, dorsal anterior cingulate activation to social
   targets predicted the severity of social impairments in a subset of the
   ASD sample. These data suggest that the dorsal anterior cingulate
   mediates social target detection in neurotypical individuals and is
   implicated in deficits of cognitive control of social information in
   ASD.}},

Abstract = {{The present study examines the influence of induced affective state on
   performance monitoring. The electroencephalogram was recorded while
   human participants engaged in a speeded choice-reaction time task
   commonly used to examine performance monitoring processes. Prior to the
   experiment, participants were randomly allocated to receive either
   encouraging or derogatory feedback during task execution. Feedback was
   based on each participant's reaction times. Affective state was assessed
   prior and after the experiment with a state questionnaire. Although
   participants of both feedback groups loaded high on items describing
   tiredness in the state questionnaire, only those with derogatory
   feedback loaded higher on negative state items and lower on positive
   state items after completion of the experiment. The error-related
   negativity (ERN) as an index of performance monitoring was increased
   after derogatory feedback; this difference was not seen at the beginning
   of the experiment. Negative state correlated significantly with ERN
   amplitude. The error positivity, a later component following errors, did
   not differ between feedback groups. This study provides further evidence
   that changes in affective state influence how we monitor ongoing

Abstract = {{We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine
   whether depressed (vs non-depressed) adults showed differences in
   cortical activation in response to stimuli representing personal goals.
   Drawing upon regulatory focus theory as well as previous research, we
   predicted that depressed patients would manifest attenuated left
   orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) activation in response to their own promotion
   goals as well as exaggerated right OFC activation in response to their
   own prevention goals. Unmedicated adults with major depression (n = 22)
   and adults with no history of affective disorder (n = 14) completed
   questionnaires and a personal goal interview. Several weeks later, they
   were scanned during a judgment task which (unknown to them) included
   stimuli representing their promotion and prevention goals. Both groups
   showed similar patterns of task-related activation. Consistent with
   predictions, patients showed significantly decreased left OFC and
   increased right OFC activation compared to controls on trials in which
   they were exposed incidentally to their promotion and prevention goals,
   respectively. The results suggest that depression involves dysfunction
   in processing two important types of personal goals. The findings extend
   models of the etiology of depression to incorporate cognitive and
   motivational processes underlying higher order goal representation and
   ultimately may provide an empirical basis for treatment matching.}},

Abstract = {{The development of reward-based learning and decision-making, and the
   neural circuitry underlying these processes, appears to be influenced
   negatively by adverse child-rearing environments characterized by abuse
   and other forms of maltreatment. No research to-date has investigated
   whether normative variations in the child-rearing environment have
   effects on adolescent brain structure. We examined whether normative
   variations in maternal responses to adolescents' positive affective
   behavior were associated with morphometric measures of the adolescents'
   affective neural circuitry, namely the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex
   (OFC), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Healthy adolescents (N =
   113) participated in laboratory-based interaction tasks with their
   mothers, and underwent high-resolution (3T) structural magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI). The mother-adolescent interactions included a
   pleasant event-planning interaction (EPI) and a conflictual
   problem-solving interaction (PSI). Adolescents, whose mothers displayed
   more punishing responses to their positive affective behavior during
   both tasks, and only during the PSI, had larger left dorsal ACC and
   bilateral OFC volumes, respectively. In addition, boys whose mothers
   evidenced this pattern of behavior during the EPI had larger right
   amygdala volumes. These results suggest that normative variations in
   maternal responses to affective behavior are associated with the
   structural characteristics of adolescents' affective neural circuitry,
   which may have implications for the development of their social,
   cognitive and affective functioning.}},

Abstract = {{Phobic responses are strong emotional reactions towards phobic objects,
   which can be described as a deficit in the automatic regulation of
   emotions. Difficulties in the voluntary cognitive control of these
   emotions suggest a further phobia-specific deficit in effortful emotion
   regulation mechanisms. The actual study is based on this emotion
   regulation conceptualization of specific phobias. The aim is to
   investigate the neural correlates of these two emotion regulation
   deficits in spider phobics. Sixteen spider phobic females participated
   in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in which they
   were asked to voluntarily up- and down-regulate their emotions elicited
   by spider and generally aversive pictures with a reappraisal strategy.
   In line with the hypothesis concerning an automatic emotion regulation
   deficit, increased activity in the insula and reduced activity in the
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex was observed. Furthermore,
   phobia-specific effortful regulation within phobics was associated with
   altered activity in medial prefrontal cortex areas. Altogether, these
   results suggest that spider phobic subjects are indeed characterized by
   a deficit in the automatic as well as the effortful regulation of
   emotions elicited by phobic compared with aversive stimuli. These two
   forms of phobic emotion regulation deficits are associated with altered
   activity in different medial prefrontal cortex subregions.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigated whether emotionally expressive faces
   guide attention and modulate fMRI activity in fusiform gyrus in acquired
   prosopagnosia. Patient PS, a pure case of acquired prosopagnosia with
   intact right middle fusiform gyrus, performed two behavioral experiments
   and a functional imaging experiment to address these questions. In a
   visual search task involving face stimuli, PS was faster to select the
   target face when it was expressing fear or happiness as compared to when
   it was emotionally neutral. In a change detection task, PS detected
   significantly more changes when the changed face was fearful as compared
   to when it was neutral. Finally, an fMRI experiment showed enhanced
   activation to emotionally expressive faces and bodies in right fusiform
   gyrus. In addition, PS showed normal body-selective activation in right
   fusiform gyrus, partially overlapping the fusiform face area. Together
   these behavioral and neuroimaging results show that attention was
   preferentially allocated to emotional faces in patient PS, as observed
   in healthy subjects. We conclude that systems involved in the emotional
   guidance of attention by facial expression can function normally in
   acquired prosopagnosia, and can thus be dissociated from systems
   involved in face identification.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with Williams syndrome (WS), a genetically determined
   disorder, show relatively strong face-processing abilities despite poor
   visuospatial skills and depressed intellectual function. Interestingly,
   beginning early in childhood they also show an unusually high level of
   interest in face-to-face social interaction. We employed functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate physiological responses
   in face-sensitive brain regions, including ventral occipito-temporal
   cortex and the amygdala, in this unique genetic disorder. Participants
   included 17 individuals with WS, 17 age- and gender-matched healthy
   adults (chronological age-matched controls, CA) and 17 typically
   developing 8- to 9-year-old children (developmental age controls, DA).
   While engaged in a face discrimination task, WS participants failed to
   recruit the amygdala, unlike both CA and DA controls. WS fMRI responses
   in ventral occipito-temporal cortex, however, were comparable to those
   of DA controls. Given the integral role of the amygdala in social
   behavior, the failure of WS participants to recruit this region during
   face processing may be a neural correlate of the abnormally high
   sociability that characterizes this disorder.}},

Abstract = {{When a visual stimulus is quickly followed in time by a second visual
   stimulus, we are normally unable to perceive it consciously. This study
   examined how affective states influence this temporal limit of conscious
   perception. Using a masked visual perception task, we found that the
   temporal threshold for access to consciousness is decreased in negative
   mood and increased in positive mood. To identify the brain mechanisms
   associated with this effect, we analysed brain oscillations. The
   mood-induced differences in perception performance were associated with
   differences in ongoing alpha power (around 10Hz) before stimulus
   presentation. Additionally, after stimulus presentation, the better
   performance during negative mood was associated with enhanced global
   coordination of neuronal activity of theta oscillations (around 5Hz).
   Thus, the effect of mood on the speed of conscious perception seems to
   depend on changes in oscillatory brain activity, rendering the cognitive
   system more or less sensitive to incoming stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{Reciprocity of trust is important for social interaction and depends on
   individual differences in social value orientation (SVO). Here, we
   examined the neural correlates of reciprocity by manipulating two
   factors that influence reciprocal behavior: (1) the risk that the
   trustor took when trusting and (2) the benefit for the trustee when
   being trusted. FMRI results showed that anterior Medial Prefrontal
   Frontal Cortex (aMPFC) was more active when participants defected
   relative to when participants reciprocated, but was not sensitive to
   manipulations of risk and benefit or individual differences in SVO.
   However, activation in the temporal-parietal-junction (rTPJ), bilateral
   anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was modulated by
   individual differences in SVO. In addition, these regions were
   differentially sensitive to manipulations of risk for the trustor when
   reciprocating. In contrast, the ACC and the right dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex were sensitive to the benefit for the trustee when
   reciprocating. Together, the results of this study provide more insight
   in how several brain regions work together when individuals reciprocate
   trust, by showing how these regions are differentially sensitive to
   reciprocity motives and perspective-taking.}},

Abstract = {{Major depression is associated with an excessive self-focus, a tendency
   to engage oneself in self-referential processing. The medial frontal
   gyrus (MFG) is central to self-referential processing. This study aimed
   to explore the neural bases of this excessive self-focus and to
   disambiguate the role of the MFG in the pathophysiology of major
   depression. We presented 15 depressed patients and 15 healthy subjects
   with personality traits during functional magnetic resonance imaging and
   asked them to judge whether each trait described them (self condition)
   or a generally desirable trait (general condition). Both patients and
   healthy subjects activated the MFG in self vs general condition.
   However, the activation of the dorsal part of the MFG and of the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in self vs general condition was
   unique to patients. Additionally, patients displayed an increased
   functional connectivity between the MFG, the dorsal anterior cingulate
   cortex and the DLPFC. These results provide evidence for an extended
   medial prefrontal network during self-referential processing in major
   depression, suggesting the involvement of a greater cognitive control.}},

Abstract = {{Sleep has been implicated as playing a critical role in memory
   consolidation. Emerging evidence suggests that reactivation of memories
   during sleep may facilitate the transfer of declarative memories from
   the hippocampus to the neocortex. Previous rodent studies have utilized
   sleep-deprivation to examine the role of sleep in memory consolidation.
   The present study uses a novel, naturalistic paradigm to study the
   effect of a sleep phase on rodent Pavlovian fear conditioning, a task
   with both hippocampus-dependent and -independent components (contextual
   vs. cued memories). Mice were trained 1 hour before their sleep/rest
   phase or awake/active phase and then tested for contextual and cued fear
   12 or 24 hr later. The authors found that hippocampus-dependent
   contextual memory was enhanced if tested after a sleep phase within 24
   hr of training. This enhancement was specific to context. not cued,
   memory. These findings provide direct evidence of a role for sleep in
   enhancing hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation in rodents and
   detail a novel paradigm for examining sleep-induced memory effects.}},

Abstract = {{Increased striatal dopamine D2 receptor activity is thought to
   contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. To model this
   condition in mice, Kellendonk et al. (2006) generated transgenic mice
   that selectively overexpress the D2 receptor in striatum (D2OE). Drew et
   al. (2007) reponed that D2OE mice display deficits in interval timing
   and motivation. The present study further explored the impaired timing
   in D2OE mice. Experiment 1 assessed the role of motivation in producing
   timing deficits in the peak procedure and found that performance in D2OE
   mice was improved by increasing motivation. In addition, performance was
   impaired in control mice when motivation was decreased. In Experiment 2,
   we found that D2OE mice have no timing impairment when tested using the
   bisection task, a procedure in which the measure of timing performance
   is less influenced by motivation to respond. In Experiment 3, we also
   used the bisection task and found selective impairment in timing of long
   durations in D2OE mice. These results suggest that striatal D2
   overexpression impairs timing by decreasing motivation and through its
   impact on working memory and/or sustained attention.}},

Abstract = {{Mother rabbits nurse once daily with circadian periodicity. The authors
   investigated brain structures involved in regulating this activity by
   quantifying c-FOS-immunoreactive (IR) cells in the forebrain of: (1)
   mothers killed on postpartum Day 1 (PPD 1) after nursing (Group 1) or
   not given pups (Group 2); (2) mothers killed on PPD, 7 after nursing
   (Group 3) or not given pups on such day (Group 4); (3) unmated virgins
   (Group 5). Groups 1 through 4 showed similar numbers of c-FOS-IR cells
   in the preoptic area, an amount around three to fourfold larger than
   that found in virgins. Nursing increased, on PPD 1 and 7, c-FOS-IR cell
   number in the lateral septum and paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei.
   No differences were seen among Groups 1 through 5 in the suprachiasmatic
   nucleus. In the ventromedial hypothalamus virgins had more c-FOS-IR
   cells compared with Groups 1 and 2. Results suggest that specific
   forebrain structures participate in regulating particular aspects of
   rabbit maternal behavior: the POA and LS seem associated with the
   establishment of motherhood and the magnocellular nuclei with the

Title = {{Temporary Inactivation of Ventral Tegmental Area Neurons With Either

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of inactivation of
   ventral tegmental area (VTA) projection neurons, while sparing fibers of
   passage, on maternal behavior in rats. Because VTA neurons contain
   GABA-A and GABA-B receptors, the effects of muscimol or baclofen were
   studied. Although bilateral injections of either drug into the VTA
   disrupted maternal behavior, it is likely that they did so through
   different underlying mechanisms. Muscimol disrupted both retrieval of
   pups and nursing behavior, while causing stereotyped motor activity.
   Baclofen disrupted retrieval behavior without affecting nursing
   behavior, and control injections of baclofen into the region dorsal to
   VTA were ineffective. The effects of VTA baclofen on maternal behavior
   are similar to the effects of interference with mesolimbic dopamine (DA)
   function. The case is made that muscimol probably caused a
   hyper-excitation of VTA DA neurons through a process of disinhibition.
   In contrast, baclofen may have depressed the activity of all VTA
   projection neurons, including VTA DA neurons. Baclofen is a promising
   tool to explore whether medial preoptic area neurons interact with VTA
   neurons to control active maternal responses.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient discrimination between individuals of closely related species

   involvement of the MeA in discrimination by females between odors of
   conspecific males and odors of males of a closely related species. The
   authors exposed estrous or diestrous female hamsters (Mesocricetus
   auratus) to saline, conspecific male odors, or heterospecific (M.
   brandti) male odors and quantified the expression of c-fos-related
   antigens in the anterior and posterior MeA. They found that estrous (but
   not diestrous) females investigated conspecific male odors longer than
   heterospecific male odors. Neural activity in both the anterior and the
   posterior MeA was higher in estrous than in diestrous females. In the
   anterior MeA, there were no significant differences in response to odors
   of conspecific and heterospecific males. In the posterior MeA, however,
   neural activity was higher when estrous females were exposed to
   conspecific odors than when they were exposed to heterospecific odors.
   No such difference was observed in diestrous females.}},

Abstract = {{The cholinergic system is important for learning, memory, and responses
   to novel stimuli. Exposure to novel, but not familiar, tastes increases
   extracellular acetylcholine (ACh) levels in insular cortex (IC). To
   further examine whether cholinergic activation is a critical signal of
   taste novelty, in these studies carbachol, a direct cholinergic agonist,
   was infused into IC before conditioned taste aversion (CTA) training
   with a familiar taste. By mimicking the cholinergic activation generated
   by novel taste exposure, it was hypothesized that a familiar taste would
   be treated as novel and therefore a salient target for aversion
   learning. As predicted, rats infused with the agonist were able to
   acquire CTAs to familiar saccharin. Effects of carbachol infusion on
   patterns of neuronal activation during conditioned
   stimulus-unconditioned stimulus pairing were assessed using Fos-like
   immunoreactivity (FLI). Familiar taste-illness pairing following
   carbachol, but not vehicle, induced significant elevations of FLI in
   amygdala, a region with reciprocal connections to IC that is also
   important for CTA learning. These results support the view that IC ACh
   activity provides a critical signal of taste novelty that facilitates
   CTA acquisition.}},

Abstract = {{In an earlier work (S. E. Swithers \& T. L. Davidson, 2008), rats
   provided with a fixed amount of a yogurt diet mixed with saccharin
   gained more weight and showed impaired caloric compensation relative to
   rats given the same amount of yogurt mixed with glucose. The present 4
   experiments examined the generality of these findings and demonstrated
   that increased body weight gain was also demonstrated when animals
   consumed a yogurt diet sweetened with an alternative high-intensity
   sweetener (acesulfame potassium; AceK) as well as in animals given a
   saccharin-sweetened base diet (refried beans) that was calorically
   similar but nutritionally distinct from low-fat yogurt. These studies
   also extended earlier findings by showing that body weight differences
   persist after saccharin-sweetened diets are discontinued and following a
   shift to a diet sweetened with glucose. In addition, rats first exposed
   to a diet sweetened with glucose still gain additional weight when
   subsequently exposed to a saccharin-sweetened diet. The results of these
   experiments add support to the hypothesis that exposure to weak or
   nonpredictive relationships between sweet tastes and caloric
   consequences may lead to positive energy balance.}},

Abstract = {{The present experiments were conducted to provide a more detailed
   behavioral analysis of the dissociable roles of the basolateral (BLA)
   and central nucleus (CeA) of the amygdala in mediating intra-accumbens
   (Acb) opioid-induced feeding of a high-fat diet. Confirming previous
   findings, temporary inactivation of the CeA with the GABA(A) agonist
   muscimol reduced DAMGO (D-Ala2-NMe-Phe4-Glyol5-enkephalin)-induced and
   baseline food intake, whereas intra-BLA muscimol selectively blocked
   only DAMGO-induced food intake, leaving baseline feeding intact.
   However. although inactivation of the BLA reduced DAMGO-induced food
   intake to control levels, this treatment led to exaggerated number and
   duration of food hopper entries after food intake had ended. A
   subsequent experiment under conditions of limited access to the diet
   found the identical pattern of behavior following intra-Acb
   administration of DAMGO, regardless of whether the BLA was inactivated.
   Last, BLA inactivation was shown to have no influence on feeding driven
   by a state of negative-energy balance (24-hr food deprivation),
   demonstrating a specific influence of the BLA on opioid-driven feeding.
   These findings suggest that BLA mediates palatability-driven feeding and
   that this influence is particular to the consummatory act of ingestion.}},

Abstract = {{Poor impulse control has been associated with compulsive drug seeking
   and an enhanced risk of relapse, suggesting that impulsivity is causally
   related to addiction proneness and relapse vulnerability. However,
   whether this association is specific to drugs of abuse or whether
   heightened impulsivity relates to a general increase in sensitivity to
   rewards and reward-associated stimuli is unknown. To address this issue,
   the authors selected rats on the basis of individual differences in
   impulsive action in the 5-choice serial reaction time task. after which
   they were subjected to an operant sucrose self-administration paradigm.
   High-impulsive rats displayed a progressive increase in responding on
   the active hole (including responses emitted during the time-out period)
   in comparison with low-impulsive rats, which reflects escalation of
   sucrose-seeking behavior. Once Sucrose and sucrose-associated stimuli
   were omitted (extinction training), nose-poke responding ceased rapidly,
   an effect that was independent of impulsivity level. In contrast, on
   reintroduction of sucrose-associated stimuli, sucrose seeking was
   successfully reinstated in high-impulsive but not in low-impulsive rats.
   Collectively, the results suggest that impaired response inhibition is
   associated with enhanced responsiveness to reward-associated stimuli. As
   such, elevated impulsivity might constitute a risk factor for the
   initiation and maintenance of addictive behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Turtles were run on a negative patterning task involving 2 positive
   elements, a key with white stripes on a black background, and a solid

   saline were started at the same time that the compound stimulus was
   introduced, after the animals had been autoshaped to press the key for
   each of the elements. Scopolamine disrupted the learning of negative
   patterning, but methylscopolamine had no effect. In contrast, learning
   of a simple discrimination between the elements was not affected by
   scopolamine. These results show that muscarinic cholinergic receptors

Abstract = {{Adult Japanese quail display left-eye/right-hemisphere dominance in
   visually guided sexual tracking. In 2 experiments, the authors set out
   to answer if this functional cerebral asymmetry is modifiable by
   posthatch monocular deprivation, In Experiment 1, the left or the right
   eye of 2-day old quail were closed for 70 days. Quail were run in a
   left- or a right-turning runway to obtain access to a conspecific of the
   opposite sex. The performance of both left and right eye systems was
   equal. In Experiment 2, the deprived eyes of the quail were opened and
   the previously open eyes were closed. They were tested with the same
   runways. Overall, running speed was very low, but the quail showed a
   left-eye/right-hemisphere superiority. Altogether, these experiments
   evince 3 insights into cerebral asymmetries in quail. First, posthatch
   asymmetries of visual input can alter lateralized behavior to an
   important extent. Second, cerebral asymmetries could involve an
   interhemispheric inhibition that can be modified by epigenetic factors.
   Third, even long-term visual deprivation does not abolish a previously
   established cerebral asymmetry.}},

Abstract = {{Rising sound intensity provides an important cue for the detection of
   looming objects. Studies with humans indirectly suggest that rising
   pitch can also signal a looming object. This link between rising
   intensity and rising frequency is puzzling because no physical rise in
   frequency occurs when a sound source approaches. Putative explanations
   include (a) the idea that the loudness of sound depends on its
   frequency, (b) the frequent co-occurrence of rising intensity with
   rising frequency in vocalizations generates an association between the 2
   features, and (c) auditory neurons process amplitude- and
   frequency-modulated sounds similarly. If these hypotheses are valid,
   then rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta)-which share some homologies in the
   vocal production apparatus and auditory system-should also associate
   rising frequency with rising intensity, and thus should perceive rising
   frequency as a looming sound source. A head-turning assay and a
   preferential-looking paradigm revealed that monkeys show an attentional
   bias toward rising versus falling frequency sounds and link the former
   to visual looming signals. This suggests that monkeys hear a rising
   frequency sound as a looming sound source even though, in the real
   world. no such link exists.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated whether the retention interval after an aversive
   learning experience influences the return of fear after extinction
   training. After fear conditioning, participants underwent extinction
   training either 5 min or 1 day later and in either the same room (same
   context) or a different room (context shift). The next day, conditioned
   fear was tested in the original room. When extinction took place
   immediately, fear renewal was robust and prolonged for context-shift
   participants, and spontaneous recovery was observed in the same-context
   participants. Delayed extinction, by contrast, yielded a brief form of
   fear renewal that reextinguished within the testing session for
   context-shift participants, and there was no spontaneous recovery in the
   same-context participants. The authors conclude that the passage of time
   allows for memory consolidation processes to promote the formation of
   distinct yet flexible emotional memory traces that confer an ability to
   recall extinction, even in an alternate context, and minimize the return
   of fear. Furthermore, immediate extinction can yield spontaneous
   recovery and prolong fear renewal. These findings have potential
   implications for ameliorating fear relapse in anxiety disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Recent work on the long-term stability of memory and synaptic plasticity
   has identified a potentially critical role for protein kinase Mzeta (PKM
   zeta). PKM zeta is a constitutively active, atypical isoform of protein
   kinase C that is believed to maintain long term potentiation at
   hippocampal synapses in vitro. In behaving animals, local inhibition of
   PKM zeta disrupts spatial memory in the hippocampus and conditioned
   taste aversion memory in the insular cortex. The role of PKM zeta in
   context fear memory is less clear. This study examined the role of PKM
   zeta in amygdala and hippocampal neurons following a standard fear
   conditioning protocol. The results indicate that PKM zeta inhibition in
   the amygdala, but not in the hippocampus, can disrupt fear memory. This
   suggests that PKM zeta may only maintain select forms of memory in
   specific brain structures and does not participate in a universal memory
   storage mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{J. E. Dunsmoor, P. A. Bandettini, and D. C. Knight (2007) conducted a
   neuroimaging study of human fear conditioning and analyzed brain
   activity under various pairing rates between a conditioned and an
   unconditioned stimulus. Computer simulations with an
   attentional-associative model introduced by N. A. Schmajuk, Y. W. Lam,
   and J. A. Gray (1996) show that activity in the amygdala and anterior
   cingulate cortex is well described by a variable representing the
   prediction of the unconditioned stimulus, whereas activity in the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and insula is well captured by a variable
   coding the attentional-modulated representation of conditioned stimuli.
   In addition, the model explains how those variables control behavior and
   provides a clear framework in which those variables play important roles
   in the description of numerous classical conditioning paradigms. Also,
   the model offers a number of predictions related to stimulus novelty for
   future neuroimaging studies of associative learning.}},

Abstract = {{Eyeblink conditioning involves the pairing of a conditioned stimulus
   (tone) to an aversive unconditioned stimulus (air puff). Although the
   circuitry that underlies this form of teaming is well defined, synaptic
   changes in these structures have not been fully investigated. This
   experiment examined synaptic structural plasticity in the cerebellar
   cortex, a structure that has been found to modulate the acquisition and
   timing of the conditioned response. Long-term depression of Purkinje
   cells (PCs) in the cerebellar cortex has been proposed as a mechanism
   for releasing inhibition of the interpositus nuclei, a structure
   critical for the formation of the CR. Adult albino rabbits were randomly
   allocated to either a paired, impaired, or exposure-only condition. The
   results showed a significant decrease in the number of excitatory
   synapses in the outer layer of the cerebellar cortex in the conditioned
   rabbits compared with controls. This finding suggests that a reduction
   in the number of excitatory synapses may contribute to the lasting
   depression of PC activity that is associated with eyeblink conditioning.}},

Abstract = {{The potential role of the prelimbic cortex of the rat in the acquisition
   of instrumental responding is currently uncertain. In addition, modeling
   the acquisition of Pavlovian and spatial conditioning tasks has
   suggested that the process of acquisition can, for certain forms of
   learning, be step like and consequently misrepresented in averaged group
   curves. Here, the authors report an experiment investigating the
   potential involvement of the prelimbic cortex in instrumental
   acquisition, in which the authors used the control data to model
   individual acquisition curves mathematically. The authors show that
   instrumental acquisition under fixed interval schedules was a gradual
   process extending over 4 instrumental sessions that is well represented
   in averaged group curves. Postsession infusion of a protein synthesis
   inhibitor into the prelimbic cortex did not affect any measure of
   acquisition, showing that during acquisition the prelimbic cortex does
   not mediate postsession consolidation of instrumental learning. However,
   inactivation of the prelimbic cortex increased responding, suggesting
   that the prelimbic cortex mediates a form of inhibitory response
   control.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to examine the association between
   prenatal psychosocial stress exposure and subsequent prefrontal
   cortex-dependent working memory performance in human adults. Working
   memory performance was assessed using an item-recognition task under 10
   mg hydrocortisone (cortisol) and placebo conditions in a sample of 32
   healthy young women (mean age = 25 +/- 4.34 years) whose mothers
   experienced a major negative life event during their pregnancy (Prenatal
   Stress, PS group), and in a comparison group of 27 healthy young women
   (mean age = 24 +/- 3.4 years). The two groups did not differ in the
   placebo condition, however, subjects in the PS group showed longer
   reaction times after hydrocortisone administration compared with
   subjects in the comparison group (p = .02). These findings provide
   support for an association between prenatal stress exposure and the
   potential modulatory effect of cortisol on working memory performance in
   young adults, which may reflect compromised development of the
   prefrontal cortex in prenatal life.}},

Abstract = {{Cannabis use was positively associated with high P50 ratios and
   negatively with post-S2 event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) gamma
   power. Findings suggest that heavy cannabis use is associated with
   aberrant beta and gamma activity in the dual-click procedure, which
   corroborates recent work demonstrating central cannabinoid receptors
   mediate neural oscillations and are localized to networks implicated in
   auditory P50 sensory gating, including the hippocampus and neocortex.
   The current study examined whether neural oscillations evoked by the
   paired clicks (S1, S2) are associated with abnormal P50 gating reported
   in cannabis users. Seventeen heavy cannabis users and 16 cannabis naive
   controls participated. Analyses included P50 amplitudes, and
   time-frequency analyses (ERSPs; intertrial coherence, ITC). Consistent
   with prior studies, cannabis users exhibited reduced P50 gating. The
   ERSP analysis yielded attenuated high frequency activity in the beta
   range (13-29 Hz) post-S1 and in the gamma range (30-50 Hz) post-S2 in
   the cannabis group, compared with the control group. Greater levels of
   disruption of beta/gamma by cannabinoid receptor (CB1) agonists in a rat
   analogue of this task and highlights the translational potential of the

Abstract = {{Exercise improves cardiovascular health, strengthens muscles and bones.
   stimulates neuroplasticity, and promotes feelings of well-being.
   However, when taken to extremes, exercise can develop into an
   addictive-like behavior. To assess the addictive potential of exercise,
   withdrawal symptoms following injections of 1.0 mg/kg naloxone were
   compared in active and inactive male and female rats. Active and
   inactive rats were given food for 1 hr or 24 hr/day. Additionally, a
   group of inactive rats was pair-fed the amount of food Consumed oil the
   previous day by food-restricted active rats. Rats fed for 1 hr/day
   decreased food intake and lost weight. Additionally, food-restricted
   active rats increased wheel running. There was a direct relationship
   between the intensity of running and the severity of withdrawal
   symptoms. Active food-restricted rats displayed the most withdrawal
   symptoms, followed by active rats given 24-hr access to food. Only
   minimal withdrawal symptoms were observed in inactive rats. These
   findings support the hypothesis that exercise-induced increases in
   endogenous opioid peptides act in a manner similar to chronic

Abstract = {{In Experiment 1, water-deprived rats had 5-min access to saccharin
   followed by active or yoked intravenous delivery of saline or cocaine
   (0.33 mg/infusion). Both cocaine groups avoided intake of the saccharin
   cue following saccharin-cocaine pairings; however, the rats in the yoked
   condition exhibited greater avoidance of the taste cue than did the
   actively administering rats. Experiment 2 evaluated subsequent
   self-administration behavior on fixed- and progressive-ratio schedules
   of reinforcement. The results showed that prior yoked exposure to
   cocaine reduced subsequent drug-taking behavior on a progressive-ratio
   but not on a fixed-ratio schedule. Finally, Experiment 3 used a choice
   test to determine the impact of yoked drug delivery on the relative
   preference for cocaine versus water. The results showed that rats with a
   history of self-administering cocaine preferred to perform operant
   behaviors on the side of the chamber previously paired with cocaine,
   whereas the rats with a history of yoked delivery of cocaine avoided
   this side. These data show that, in most rats, the unpredictable,
   uncontrollable delivery of cocaine protects against the subsequent
   motivation for cocaine through an aversive mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure to alcohol during adolescence is predictive of adult alcohol
   abuse and dependence. The present experiment was designed to measure the
   impact of appetitive motivational engagement with ethanol during
   adolescence on adult ethanol consumption. To this end, a group of
   adolescent male Wistar rats was allowed to traverse an operant runway to
   obtain access to a sweetened 10\% ethanol solution (wt/vol) over 18
   sessions. An additional yoked-control group was allowed access to an
   identical solution; however, exposure to the solution was contingent on
   the experimental groups entry into the goal box of the runway. Once the
   adolescent exposure sessions were completed, the animals were allowed to
   mature into adults and then tested for differences in ethanol
   consumption during 30-min 2-bottle limited access sessions. Following 14
   ethanol consumption sessions during adulthood, a naltrexone
   dose-response challenge (0-0.4 mg/kg) was initiated for both groups. The
   results of the experiment showed that the animals allowed to traverse
   the runway during adolescence displayed increased ethanol consumption
   during adulthood when compared to the yoked-control group. In addition,
   both groups showed dose-dependent attenuation of ethanol consumption by
   naltrexone. Thus, appetitive motivational experience during adolescence
   can impact adult ethanol consummatory behavior, a process that appears
   to involve common reinforcement-related neural substrates. This model
   should prove useful in delineating appetitive motivation-related factors
   that contribute to excessive ethanol consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Genomic imprinting represents a mechanism through which parent-of-origin
   effects on offspring development may be mediated. However, investigation
   of the influence of imprinted genes on behavior has been limited. Here
   the authors investigate the role of the maternally imprinted/paternally
   expressed gene, Peg3, in several aspects of behavior using both 129Sv-
   and B6-Peg3 mutant female mice. Virgin Peg3 females on both genetic
   backgrounds were less exploratory and had higher rates of defecation
   with strain-dependent effects on activity levels and olfactory
   discrimination. Reproductive success, pup retrieval, and postnatal
   maternal care of pups were reduced in these females whereas indices of
   maternal aggression were higher among B6 Peg3-KO females. Differences in
   maternal care were apparent in females caring for biological or
   cross-fostered offspring and deficits in pup retrieval apparent beyond
   the immediate postpartum period. Oxytocin receptor binding in the MPOA
   and LS was reduced in Peg3-KO females. Thus, the authors demonstrate
   that disruptions to Peg3 influences aspects of female behavior that are
   critical for mediating maternal effects on offspring development, such
   as postpartum licking/grooming, and that effects of Peg3 are dependent
   on the maternal genetic background.}},

Abstract = {{There is a controversy concerning whether smelling via the nose
   (ortho-nasally) or the mouth (retro-nasally) represent two routes to the
   same modality or two distinct submodalities. Since olfactory coding is
   dependent upon experience, and since food odors are experienced
   retro-nasally, the authors tested the hypothesis that whether an odor
   represents a food may influence whether sensation via the two routes
   leads to separable responses. The authors demonstrate that salivary
   response to food odors decrease with repeated presentation and show that
   this response rebounds upon presentation of a novel food odor via the
   same route and upon presentation of the same food odor via a novel
   route. This finding indicates that the novel odor and the novel route
   represent distinct sensory signals. This effect is specific, in that it
   does not depend on differences in odor intensity or pleasantness and is
   selective, in that it occurs for food odors but not for equally pleasant
   and intense nonfood odors. These results demonstrate that separable
   signals are generated for the same food odor depending upon route and
   support the existence of category-specific processing.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were designed to determine the role of the interpeduncular
   nucleus (IPN) in 3 forms of navigation: beacon, landmark. and path
   integration. In beacon navigation, animals reach goals using cues
   directly associated with them, whereas in landmark navigation animals
   use external cues to determine a direction and distance to goals. Path
   integration refers to the use of self-movement cues to obtain a
   trajectory to a goal. IPN-lesioned rats were tested in a food-carrying
   task in which they searched for food in an open field, and returned to a
   refuge after finding the food. Landmark navigation was evaluated during
   trials performed under lighted conditions and path integration was
   tested under darkened conditions, thus eliminating external cues. We
   report that IPN lesions increased the number of errors and reduced
   heading accuracy under both lighted and darkened conditions. Tests using
   a Morris water maze procedure indicated that IPN lesions produced
   moderate impairments in the landmark version of the water task, but left
   beacon navigation intact. These findings suggest that the IPN plays a
   fundamental role in landmark navigation and path integration.}},

Abstract = {{The present study used 2 different discrimination tasks designed to
   isolate distinct components of visuospatial learning: structural
   learning and geometric learning. Structural learning refers to the
   ability to learn the precise combination of stimulus identity with
   stimulus location. Rats with anterior thalamic lesions and fornix
   lesions were unimpaired on a configural learning task in which the rats
   learned 3 concurrent mirror-image discriminations (structural learning).
   Indeed, both lesions led to facilitated learning. In contrast, anterior
   thalamic lesions impaired the geometric discrimination (e.g.. swim to
   the corner with the short wall to the right of the long wall). Finally,
   both the fornix and anterior thalamic lesions severely impaired T-maze
   alternation, a task that taxes an array of spatial strategies including
   allocentric learning. This pattern of dissociations and double
   dissociations highlights how distinct classes of spatial learning rely
   on different systems, even though they may converge on the hippocampus.
   Consequently. the findings suggest that structural learning is heavily
   dependent on cortico-hippocampal interactions. In contrast, subcortical
   inputs (such as those from the anterior thalamus) contribute to
   geometric learning.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies show discrepancies concerning the effects of
   pretraining on spatial learning deficits induced by blockade of the
   N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. These inconsistencies might be
   attributed to the differences in the nature of the pretraining tasks and
   the method of blocking NMDA receptors. In the present study, the authors
   pretrained rats in a spatial water maze task. The authors then trained
   them with a novel spatial task in a novel environment under chronic
   blockade of hippocampal NMDA receptors by intrahippocampal infusion of
   2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5) using osmotic pumps. Although
   the rats had acquired the basic techniques needed to solve a water-maze
   spatial task during pretraining, those given high or low doses of AP5
   showed acquisition deficits. As the spatial pretraining failed to
   ameliorate the acquisition deficits of a new task in a novel
   environment, it was suggested that NMDA receptors were necessary in
   forming spatial representations. Because neither dose of AP5 affected
   the performance of a spatial task in the retention phase, sensory motor
   disturbances could not have caused these deficits.}},

Abstract = {{The Barnes maze offers advantages for cognitive aging Studies, because
   of its relatively unstressful design and its modest physical demands.
   The authors therefore undertook a detailed chronological investigation
   of performance against age, for female Sprague-Dawley and male and
   female Dark Agouti rats. The trial duration was 10 days. Rats were
   tested at 6, 11, 14, 17, 20, and 26 months of age, but individual rats
   were tested at one age only. At 6 months of age, all rats reached the
   criterion. Sprague-Dawley rats performed best at this age. Impairment
   began at 14 months in Dark Agouti rats and continued to increase up to
   26 months of age. Impairment was greater in Dark Agouti than
   Sprague-Dawley rats and was greater in females than males. At 26 months,
   70\% of Sprague-Dawley females reached criterion; of the Dark Agoutis,
   only 33\% of females and 57\% of males reached criterion. This study
   confirms the utility of the Barnes maze as a robust vehicle in aged
   rats. It also highlights major performance differences between strains
   and genders in aging rats.}},

Abstract = {{Female rats exhibit a conditioned place preference (CPP) for a context

   the activation of the pelvic nerve mediates the reinforcing effects of
   mating for female rats. Rats underwent bilateral pelvic nerve or sham
   transection and then received paced mating, nonpaced mating, or the
   control treatment during a CPP procedure. Pelvic nerve transection did
   not affect the CPP for paced or nonpaced mating. In tests of paced
   mating behavior. contact-return latencies following intromissions were
   significantly shorter in rats with pelvic nerve transection than they
   were in rats with sham transections. These results show that the pathway
   conveying the reinforcing effects of mating stimulation does not depend
   on the integrity of the pelvic nerve, but that activation of the pelvic
   nerve contributes to the display of paced mating behavior.}},

Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Stress has been shown to impair delayed memory retrieval, but so far no
   study has been conducted solely with naturally cycling women. In a
   crossover design. 36 women (all in the luteal phase) participated in two
   experimental conditions (stress vs. control). Delayed memory retrieval
   of a wordlist learned 24 hours earlier was tested after stress or
   control treatment. Although stressed subjects showed a strong cortisol
   increase following stress, no influence on memory retrieval occurred. In
   an additional data analysis, Subjects were split up into a cortisol
   responder and a cortisol nonresponder group. However, again no evidence
   for a stress-induced retrieval impairment became apparent. Similarly, no
   correlation was observed between the stress-induced cortisol increase
   and memory. This study failed to find an influence of stress on memory
   retrieval in women tested in the luteal phase. The findings are in
   contrast to our previous results obtained with men. Evidence is
   discussed that the luteal phase, which is characterized by elevated
   gonadal steroids, is associated with reduced glucocorticoid sensitivity.
   This might underlie the missing impact of stress on memory.}},

Abstract = {{The GABA(B) agonist baclofen has been shown to alter ethanol intake in
   human and animal studies (E. M. Moore et al., 2007). GABA(B) receptors
   are located within the ventral tegmental area (VTA: A. Imperato \& G.
   DiChiara, 1986) and therefore may be involved in modulating Voluntary
   ethanol intake. The present study assessed the effects of baclofen in a
   variation on a new mouse model of binge-like ethanol intake that takes
   advantage of the nocturnal nature of this species (J. S. Rhodes, K.
   Best, J. K. Belknap, D. A. Finn, \& J. C. Crabbe, 2005; J. S. Rhodes et
   al., 2007). Baclofen or saline was microinjected into the anterior or
   posterior VTA of male C57BL/6J mice. Immediately afterward, mice were
   presented with ethanol, water, or sugar water using the Drinking in the
   Dark model, a procedure of fluid administration for 2 hr, 3 hr into the
   dark cycle). Fluid intake was recorded at 30. 60, 90, and 120 min:
   retro-orbital sinus bloods were sampled upon termination of the 120-min
   ethanol access period. Baclofen reduced binge-like ethanol intake when
   microinjected into the anterior VTA, whereas posterior VTA
   microinjections did not alter ethanol intake. Baclofen had no effect on
   water or sugar water intake when administered to anterior or posterior
   VTA. These results add to the growing literature Suggesting that GABA(B)
   receptor systems are important in the modulation of binge-like ethanol
   intake and suggest that the GABA(B) receptor system may have different
   roles in anterior versus posterior VTA.}},

Abstract = {{Social stress in adolescence is correlated with emergence of
   psychopathologies during early adulthood. In this study, the authors
   investigated the impact of social defeat stress during mid-adolescence
   on adult male brain and behavior. Adolescent male Sprague-Dawley rats
   were exposed to repeated social defeat for 5 days while controls were
   placed in a novel empty cage. When exposed to defeat-associated cues as
   adults, previously defeated rats showed increased risk assessment and
   behavioral inhibition, demonstrating long-term memory for the defeat
   context. However, previously defeated rats exhibited increased
   locomotion in both elevated plus-maze and open field tests, suggesting
   heightened novelty-induced behavior. Adolescent defeat also affected
   adult monoamine levels in stress-responsive limbic regions, causing
   decreased medial prefrontal cortex dopamine, increased norepinephrine
   and serotonin in the ventral dentate gyrus, and decreased norepinephrine
   in the dorsal raphe. Our results suggest that adolescent social defeat
   produces both deficits in anxiety responses and altered monoaminergic
   function in adulthood. This model offers potential for identifying
   specific mechanisms induced by severe adolescent social stress that may
   contribute to increased adult male vulnerability to psychopathology.}},

   Study, we compared the effects of separate lesions of the NAc core, NAc

   lesions of the NAc core increased locomotion, and lesions of the core

   context-specific locomotor sensitization by enhancing the development of
   sensitization in paired rats and decreasing expression in unpaired rats
   relative to sham-operated rats when challenged with an injection of 0.4
   mg/kg nicotine in the locomotor chambers. These data are consistent with
   findings that the NAc core and the basolateral amygdala share a variety

Abstract = {{In adult male hamsters, individual differences in offensive aggression
   are correlated with differences in impulsive choice and decreased
   serotonin (5-HT) innervation. As serotonin 1A (5-HT(1A)) receptors
   participate in the inhibition of aggression, whereas 5-HT(3) receptor
   activation facilitates aggression, the authors hypothesized that
   differences in their expression are associated with differences in
   behavior. The authors confirmed previous behavioral associations, using
   a delay-discounting paradigm with various delays, as high-aggression
   (H-Agg) hamsters preferred the immediate-reward lever over the
   delayed-reward lever under most delays, compared with low-aggression
   (L-Agg) hamsters. Although the authors observed a greater density of
   5-HT(1A) receptor immunoreactivity in H-Agg hamsters within several
   areas, it appears to be related to a lack of serotonin release, as
   supported by further observations of decreased immunoreactive perikarya
   and 5-HT(1A) receptors in fluoxetine-treated hamsters. Also, 5-HT3
   receptor density was greater in H-Agg hamsters within select areas. The
   data indicate a convergence of impulsive and aggressive characteristics
   to one phenotype that is associated with various aspects of serotonin
   function, such as serotonin release and differential expression of
   5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(3) receptors.}},

   groups had free access to a running wheel for 2 weeks and then all rats
   received nonreinforced presentations of a visual stimulus (light) during
   the 1st training session, followed by daily sessions in which the light
   was paired with food. Nonexercising male and female SHR rats exhibited
   more unconditioned orienting behavior than Wistar-Kyoto rats. SHRs also
   exhibited impaired conditioning when the light was paired with food.
   Exercise reduced orienting in female SHRs but not in male SHRs. In the
   social interaction task, nonexercising male and female SHRs interacted
   more with an unfamiliar rat than Wistar-Kyoto rats. Exercise reduced the
   number of social interactions in female SHRs but not male SHRs. There
   were no differences in general locomotor activity observed between the
   nonexercising and exercising SHRs. These data indicate that exercise may
   preferentially benefit female SHRs, and has implications for using
   exercise as an intervention for ADHD and for understanding sex
   differences in the effects of exercise on behavior.}},

Title = {{Effects of the First Prepulse on the Blink Response to a Startling Noise}},

Abstract = {{Startle is inhibited when a startling stimulus follows 30-300 ins after
   a weak prepulse. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is an operational measure of
   sensorimotor gating and is deficient in several neuropsychiatric
   disorders. Previous reports argue both for and against a learned
   component to the inhibitory effects of prepulses, but this issue has yet
   to be fully investigated using stimuli that most commonly detect PPI
   deficits in clinical populations. If the inhibitory impact of a prepulse
   is learned, PPI should not be evident when the prepulse is the first
   stimulus experienced by the subject. Eyeblink electromyography in normal
   adults was recorded after either a 118 dB(A) 40-ms noise pulse alone
   (PA) or the same pulse preceded 120 ms by all 86 dB(A) 5-ms noise
   prepulse (pp + P). In 25 subjects (Order 1), Trial 1 was a PA, and Trial
   2 was a pp + P: 23 subjects experienced the opposite order (Order 2). In
   34 subjects, Trials I and 2 were both PA (control order). Background was
   70 dB(A). Startle magnitude increased from Trial I to 2 if no prepulse
   was presented (control order). Compared with the control order, startle
   inhibition by prepulses was evident in both Orders 1 and 2. and was more
   robust in Order 2 (first trial = pp + P). Startle magnitude was
   significantly lower on pp + P than on PA trials in Order 2 but not Order
   1 (F < 1). Prepulses inhibit startle on the first pairing with a
   startling pulse, an effect that cannot be explained by learning.}},

Abstract = {{Our previous study with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist
   D-AP5 suggested that NMDA receptors were involved in learning but not
   memory consolidation of avoidance conditioning. The present study
   investigated whether nitric oxide (NO) and cyclic guanosine
   monophosphate (cGMP) were involved in memory consolidation but not
   learning of avoidance conditioning in goldfish. Experiments 1 to 3
   investigated amnestic and performance effects of NO inhibitor L-NAME and
   cGMP inhibitor LY-83583. Experiment 4 investigated whether posttraining
   intratelencephalic injection of NO donor SNAP ameliorated anterograde
   amnestic effects of pretraining NO inhibitor L-NAME. The results showed
   that L-NAME and LY-83583 produced significant anterograde and retrograde
   amnesia at doses that did not impair performance processes, and the
   drugs produced more severe retrograde than anterograde amnesia.
   Furthermore, posttraining SNAP significantly ameliorated anterograde
   amnestic effects of pretraining L-NAME. Thus, our previous results with
   D-AP5 and current results with L-NAME and LY-83583 together suggest that
   the NMDA receptors are involved in learning or the process that is
   completed during training, whereas the NO and cGMP are involved in
   memory consolidation or the process that is normally completed sometime
   following the learning experience.}},

Abstract = {{It has been proposed that the hippocampus and subcortical structures
   interact during the processing of fear and anxiety-related information.
   It has been demonstrated that the subcortical efferents from CA3 and CA1
   can be selectively disrupted without concomitant disruption to the
   afferents. The present experiment was designed to evaluate the role of
   CA3 efferents via the fimbria and the CA1 efferents via the dorsal
   fornix for encoding and consolidation/retrieval of classical fear
   conditioning. The present data suggest that the subcortical projections
   from CA3 and CA1 are differentially involved in the processing of
   classical fear conditioning, with CA3 subcortical efferents supporting
   acquisition of both cued and contextual fear but only supporting
   retention of contextual fear and CA1 subcortical efferents supporting
   the encoding and retrieval of both cited and contextual fear. These data
   further suggest that all hippocampal efferents are not homogeneous. and
   that the hippocampus and subcortex interact to process conditioned fear.}},

Abstract = {{The authors examined the relationship between hippocampal theta activity
   and trace eyeblink conditioning. Hippocampal electrophysiological local
   field potentials were recorded before, during, and after conditioning or
   explicitly unpaired training sessions in adult male New Zealand White
   rabbits. As expected, a high relative power of theta activity (theta
   ratio) in the hippocampus predicted faster acquisition of the
   conditioned response during trace conditioning but, contrary to previous
   results obtained using the delay paradigm, only in the initial stage of
   learning. The presentation of the conditioned stimulus overall elicited
   an increase in the hippocampal theta ratio. The theta ratio decreased in
   the unpaired group as a function of training, remained high throughout
   conditioning in the fast learners. and rapidly increased in the slow
   learners initially showing a low theta ratio. Our results indicate a
   reciprocal connection between the hippocampal oscillatory activity and
   associative learning. The hippocampal theta ratio seems to reflect
   changes and differences in the subjects' alertness and responsiveness to
   external stimuli, which affect the rate of learning and are, in turn,
   affected by both conditioning and unpaired training.}},

Title = {{Expression of Renewal Is Dependent on the Extinction-Test Interval

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{123}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A recent finding suggested that when extinction occurs shortly after
   acquisition, renewal of an extinguished fear response (fear-potentiated
   startle) to a light conditioned stimulus (CS) is diminished (Myers,
   Ressler, \& Davis, 2006). The present study attempted to extend this
   finding using a white-noise CS and freezing as the behavioral measure of
   fear. In Experiments I A and I B, we observed renewal whether extinction
   occurred 10 min or 24 hr after acquisition. In contrast, renewal was not
   observed if test occurred 10 min after extinction (Experiment 2).
   Experiment 3 demonstrated that expression of extinction at the 10-min
   extinction-test interval was attenuated by a pretest subcutaneous
   injection of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inverse agonist FG7142.
   These findings suggest that renewal is influenced more by the
   extinction-test interval than the acquisition-extinction interval.
   Further, the failure to see renewal 10 min after extinction suggests
   that there is a separate context memory that undergoes a different
   consolidation function than the CS-no US memory formed during
   extinction. Finally, the expression of extinction appears to be GABA
   dependent regardless of the extinction-test interval or the test
   context.}},

Abstract = {{Reductions in the volume of the cerebellum and impairments in
   cerebellar-dependent eyeblink conditioning have been observed in
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Recently, it was
   reported that subjects with ADHD as well as male spontaneously
   hypertensive rats (SHR), a strain that is frequently employed as an
   animal model in the study of ADHD, exhibit a parallel pattern of timing
   deficits in eyeblink conditioning. One criticism that has been posed
   regarding the validity of the SHR strain as an animal model for the
   study of ADHD is that SHRs are not only hyperactive but also
   hypertensive. It is conceivable that many of the behavioral
   characteristics seen in SHRs that seem to parallel the behavioral
   symptoms of ADHD are not solely due to hyperactivity but instead are the
   net outcome of the interaction between hyperactivity and hypertension.
   We used Wistar-Kyoto Hyperactive (WKHA) and Wistar-Kyoto Hypertensive
   (WKHT) rats (males and females), strains generated from recombinant
   inbreeding of SHRs and their progenitor strain, Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats,
   to compare eyeblink conditioning in strains that are exclusively
   hyperactive or hypertensive. We used a long-delay eyeblink conditioning
   task in which a tone conditioned stimulus was paired with a periorbital
   stimulation unconditioned stimulus (750-ms delay paradigm). Our results
   showed that WKHA and WKHT rats exhibited similar rates of conditioned
   response (CR) acquisition. However, WKHA males displayed shortened CR
   latencies (early onset and peak latency) in comparison to WKHT males. In
   contrast, female WKHAs and WKHTs did not differ. In subsequent
   extinction training, WKHA rats extinguished at similar rates in
   comparison to WKHT rats. The current results support the hypothesis of a
   relationship between cerebellar abnormalities and ADHD in an animal
   model of ADHD-like symptoms that does not also exhibit hypertension, and
   suggest that cerebellar-related timing deficits are specific to males.}},

Abstract = {{Fragile X syndrome, a form of mental retardation caused by inadequate
   levels of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), is characterized
   by extreme sensitivity to sensory stimuli and increased behavioral and
   hormonal reactivity to stressors. FmrI knockout mice lack FMRP and
   exhibit abnormal responses to auditory stimuli. This study sought to
   determine whether FmrI knockout mice on an F1 hybrid background are
   normal in their response to footshock. Knockout mice were also examined
   for signs of hyperexcitation across an extended trial range, and serum
   corticosterone levels were evaluated in response to various stressors.
   The ability to acquire conditioned taste aversion was also assessed.
   Knockout mice exhibited no impairment in associative aversive learning
   or memory. since they successfully expressed conditioned taste aversion.
   Footshock-sensitivity, freezing behavior. and corticosterone response to
   various stressors did not differ between knockout and wild-type mice.
   However, knockout mice exhibited significantly increased responses
   (luring the extended test. The knockout mice's increased responsiveness
   to footshock in the extended test may be an indication of increased
   vulnerability to stress or enhanced emotional reactivity.}},

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{123}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{687-693}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Abdominal muscles can be activated during rapid but complex motor
   responses known as feedforward postural adjustments. Exactly how the
   latency of feedforward adjustments compares with other responses of
   varying levels of voluntary input and motoneurone excitability remains
   unclear. Surface electrodes were placed bilaterally over abdominal
   muscles and over right anterior deltoid (AD) and orbicularis oculi (OO)
   muscles in eight healthy volunteers. Latencies were obtained during
   feedforward postural adjustment, acoustic startle reflex, and voluntary
   activation (respiratory and nonrespiratory) to soft and startling
   acoustic stimuli. Results showed voluntary activation was fastest for
   respiratory tasks during mid- or end-expiration. Voluntary activation
   was also faster when triggered by startling stimuli compared with soft
   stimuli. These responses were slower than feedforward postural
   adjustments in all subjects. Feedforward adjustments were slower than
   acoustic startle reflexes but were somewhat flexible as their amplitude
   depended on amplitude of AD activation and therefore matched parameters
   of the movement task. The latency for feedforward postural adjustments
   of abdominal muscles suggests organization at a low level of the nervous
   system with limited central processing to match postural responses to
   movement demands.}},

Volume = {{123}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The neurocircuitry mediating the emetic reflex is still incompletely
   understood, and a key question is the degree to which central and/or
   peripheral components contribute to the overall vomiting mechanism.
   Having previously found a significant peripheral component in neurokinin
   NK1-receptor mediated emesis, the authors undertook this study to
   examine the putative central component. Adult least shrews were injected
   intracerebroventricularly (icv) with saline or the blood-brain barrier
   impermeable toxin, stable substance P-saporin (SSP-SAP), which ablates
   cells expressing NK1 receptors. After 3 days, shrews were challenged
   intraperitoneally with the emetogenic NK1 agonist GR73632 at different
   doses, and vomiting and scratching behaviors were quantified. Ablation
   of NK1-bearing cells was verified immunohistochemically. Although
   SSP-SAP injection reduced emesis at GR73632 doses of 2.5 and 5 mg/kg, no
   injections completely eliminated emesis. These data demonstrate that
   there is both a major central nervous system component and a minor
   peripheral nervous system component to tachykininmediated vomiting. Side
   effects of the current generation of antiemetics could potentially be
   reduced by improving bioavailability of the drugs in the more potent
   central nervous system compartment while reducing bioavailability in the
   less potent peripheral compartment.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying another's mistakes requires a basic representation of
   other's action patterns as well as recognition and understanding of
   their failed goal-attainment. In previous work, we identified several
   regions, including inferior parietal cortex and rostral/ventral anterior
   cinguli (r/vACC), that show unique sensitivity to the observation of
   another's errors. Here we utilize the same sample to show that
   participants' level of self-reported perspective-taking (but not
   empathic concern) correlated with hemodynamic response in IPC, while
   participants' level of self-reported empathic concern (but not
   perspective taking) correlated with hemodynamic response in r/vACC. This
   functional dissociation provides strong evidence for separate roles for
   IPC and r/vACC in the processing of observed errors. IPC may foster a
   sense of agency by distinguishing self- from other-performed actions;
   r/vACC may, in turn, promote a more contextually-mediated understanding
   of the other's failed goal-attainment.}},

Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Multiple lines of evidence implicate the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and
   the noradrenergic (norepinephrine, NE) system in responding to stressful
   stimuli such as fear signals, suggesting hyperfunction of both in the
   development of stress-related pathologies including anxiety disorders.
   However, no causative link between elevated NE neurotransmission and BLA
   hyperresponsiveness to fear signals has been established to date in
   humans. To determine whether or not increased noradrenergic tone
   enhances BLA responses to fear signals, we used functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) and a strategy of pharmacologically
   potentiating NE neurotransmission in healthy volunteers. 18 subjects
   were scanned two times on a facial emotion paradigm and given either a
   single-dose placebo or 4 mg of the selective NE reuptake inhibitor
   reboxetine 2 h prior to an fMRI session. We found that reboxetine
   induced an amygdala response bias towards fear signals that did not
   exist at placebo baseline. This pharmacological effect was
   probabilistically mapped to the BLA. Extrapolation of our data to
   conditions of traumatic stress suggests that disinhibited endogenous NE
   signaling could serve as a crucial etiological contributor to
   post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by eliciting exaggerated BLA
   responses to fear signals.}},

   matched for valence, arousal and other factors. Increased amygdala
   activation was found to high impact when compared to neutral images, or
   high impact when compared to low impact images (matched for arousal).
   Our findings demonstrate that the amygdala response to emotional stimuli
   is not a function of arousal (or valence) alone and accord more with the
   proposal that the amygdala responds to the significance or relevance of
   an event.}},

Abstract = {{The adult brain is endowed with mechanisms subserving enhanced
   processing of salient emotional and social cues. Stimuli associated with
   threat represent one such class of cues. Previous research suggests that
   preferential allocation of attention to social signals of threat (i.e. a
   preference for fearful over happy facial expressions) emerges during the
   second half of the first year. The present study was designed to
   determine the age of onset for infants attentional bias for fearful
   faces. Allocation of attention was studied by measuring event-related
   potentials (ERPs) and looking times (in a visual paired comparison task)
   to fearful and happy faces in 5- and 7-month-old infants. In
   7-month-olds, the preferential allocation of attention to fearful faces
   was evident in both ERPs and looking times, i.e. the negative central
   mid-latency ERP amplitudes were more negative, and the looking times
   were longer for fearful than happy faces. No such differences were
   observed in the 5-month-olds. It is suggested that an enhanced
   sensitivity to facial signals of threat emerges between 5 and 7 months
   of age, and it may reflect functional development of the neural
   mechanisms involved in processing of emotionally significant stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{Developmental research has demonstrated the harmful effects of peer
   rejection during adolescence; however, the neural mechanisms responsible
   for this salience remain unexplored. In this study, 23 adolescents were
   excluded during a ball-tossing game in which they believed they were
   playing with two other adolescents during an fMRI scan; in reality,
   participants played with a preset computer program. Afterwards,
   participants reported their exclusion-related distress and rejection
   sensitivity, and parents reported participants' interpersonal
   competence. Similar to findings in adults, during social exclusion
   adolescents displayed insular activity that was positively related to
   self-reported distress, and right ventrolateral prefrontal activity that
   was negatively related to self-reported distress. Findings unique to
   adolescents indicated that activity in the subgenual anterior cingulate
   cortex (subACC) related to greater distress, and that activity in the
   ventral striatum related to less distress and appeared to play a role in
   regulating activity in the subACC and other regions involved in
   emotional distress. Finally, adolescents with higher rejection
   sensitivity and interpersonal competence scores displayed greater neural
   evidence of emotional distress, and adolescents with higher
   interpersonal competence scores also displayed greater neural evidence
   of regulation, perhaps suggesting that adolescents who are vigilant
   regarding peer acceptance may be most sensitive to rejection
   experiences.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation for goal-directed behaviour largely depends on the expected
   value of the anticipated reward. The aim of the present study was to
   examine how different levels of reward value are coded in the brain for
   two common forms of human reward: money and social approval. To account
   for gender differences 16 male and 16 female participants performed an
   incentive delay task expecting to win either money or positive social
   feedback. fMRI recording during the anticipation phase revealed
   proportional activation of neural structures constituting the human
   reward system for increasing levels of reward, independent of incentive
   type. However, in men activation in the prospect of monetary rewards
   encompassed a wide network of mesolimbic brain regions compared to only
   limited activation for social rewards. In contrast, in women,
   anticipation of either incentive type activated identical brain regions.
   Our findings represent an important step towards a better understanding
   of motivated behaviour by taking into account individual differences in
   reward valuation.}},

Abstract = {{In this fMRI study, we investigated theory of mind (ToM) in patients
   with paranoid schizophrenia. We hypothesized that the network supporting
   the representation of intentions is dysfunctional in patients with
   schizophrenia dependent on the type of intention involved. We used a
   paradigm including a control condition (physical causation) and three
   intention conditions (private intention, prospective social intention
   and communicative intentions) differing in the degree of social
   interaction. In all four experimental conditions patients performed
   worse than controls regarding accuracy and reaction time. They showed
   significantly less activation in three regions typically activated in
   ToM tasks, i.e. paracingulate cortex and bilateral temporo-parietal
   junctions. However, this dysfunction was dependent on the type of
   intention represented, i.e. was present only for social but not for
   non-social intentions. Moreover, part of the reduced activation was
   related to the fact that there was no signal drop in these regions for
   the physical causality condition as usually found in controls. This may
   be due to the tendency of schizophrenic patients to attribute
   intentionality to physical objects. Our findings have implications for
   the study and understanding of ToM in schizophrenia but also in other
   disorders like autism.}},

Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{This study measured event-related potentials (ERPs) during multiple goal
   and trait inferences, under spontaneous or intentional instructions.
   Participants read sentences describing several goal-implying behaviors
   of a target person from which also a strong trait could be inferred or
   not. The last word of each sentence determined the consistency with the
   inference induced during preceding sentences. In comparison with
   behaviors that implied only a goal, stronger waveforms beginning at 150
   ms were obtained when the behaviors additionally implied a trait. These
   ERPs showed considerable parallels between spontaneous and intentional
   inferences. This suggests that traits embedded in a stream of
   goal-directed behaviors were detected more rapidly and automatically
   than mere goals, irrespective of the participants spontaneous or
   intentional instructions. In line with this, source localization
   (LORETA) of the ERPs show predominantly activation in the
   temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) during 150200 ms, suggesting that goals
   were detected at that time interval. During 200300 ms, activation was
   stronger at the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) for multiple goals and
   traits as opposed to goals only, suggesting that traits were inferred
   during this time window. A cued recall measure taken after the
   presentation of the stimulus material support the occurrence of goal and
   trait inferences and shows significant correlations with the neural
   components, indicating that these components are valid neural indices of
   spontaneous and intentional social inferences. The early detection of
   multiple goal and trait inferences is explained in terms of their
   greater social relevance, leading to privileged attention allocation and
   processing in the brain.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous discoveries regarding stereotypes have been uncovered by
   utilizing techniques and methods developed by cognitive psychologists.
   The present study continues this tradition by borrowing
   psychophysiological techniques used for the study of memory and
   language, and applying them to the study of stereotypes. In this study,
   participants were primed with either the gender category Women or Men,
   followed by a word which was either consistent with gender stereotypes
   (e.g. Women: Nurturing) or inconsistent (e.g. Women: Aggressive). Their
   task was to indicate whether the words matched or did not match,
   according to gender stereotypes. Both response times and event-related
   brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded during performance of the task. As
   predicted, stereotype incongruent word pairs were associated with larger
   N400 ERP amplitudes and slower response times, relative to congruent
   word pairs. The potential utility of this approach as an independent
   measure of stereotypes is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how
   performing formalized and improvised forms of praying changed the evoked
   BOLD response in a group of Danish Christians. Distinct from formalized
   praying and secular controls, improvised praying activated a strong
   response in the temporopolar region, the medial prefrontal cortex, the
   temporo-parietal junction and precuneus. This finding supports our
   hypothesis that religious subjects, who consider their God to be real
   and capable of reciprocating requests, recruit areas of social cognition
   when they pray. We argue that praying to God is an intersubjective
   experience comparable to normal interpersonal interaction.}},

   executive function in humans, to assess the effects of bilateral lesions
   in the dorsolateral PFC on executive function in the rhesus monkey
   (Macaca mulatta). The authors used the category set-shifting task, which
   requires the monkey to establish a pattern of responding to a specific
   category (color or shape) based on reward contingency, maintain that
   pattern of responding, and then shift it) responding to a different
   category when the reward contingency changes. Rhesus monkeys with

Abstract = {{Previous research has implicated dopamine as a modulating factor in
   choice behavior based on effort. The purpose of the present study was to
   determine the individual contribution of different dopamine receptors to
   effort-based decision making in rats. Rats were trained in a T-maze to
   choose a large-reward arm that contained 8 pellets of food over a
   small-reward arm that contained 2 pellets of food. The rats then were
   trained to climb progressively higher barriers to obtain the food from
   the large-reward arm. Using a discounting procedure on each test day, it
   was found that rats were more likely to choose the small-reward arm
   after treatment with the D(1) antagonist, SCH-23390, or the D(2)
   antagonist, haloperidol. The dopamine agonist, D-amphetamine, biased the
   rats toward choosing the large-reward arm and blunted the effects of
   SCH-23390 or haloperidol. Treatment with the D(3) receptor antagonist,
   U99194, or the D(3) receptor agonist, 7-OH-DPAT, did not alter choice
   behavior. These data indicate that D(1) and D(2) receptors are required
   for decisions based on effort.}},

   were rated for clockwise and counterclockwise direction (for which no
   more than I hair whorl was present) by 2 raters unaware of sexual
   orientation. The authors found no significant difference between
   heterosexual and homosexual men in hair whorl direction, but the authors
   did replicate the fraternal birth order effect (more older brothers for
   homosexual men). Number of older sisters was positively correlated with
   counterclockwise hair whorls in heterosexual men. These data were

Abstract = {{Modafinil has been shown to promote wakefulness and some studies suggest
   the drug can improve cognitive function. Because of many similarities,
   the mechanism of action may be comparable to classical psychostimulants,
   although the exact mechanisms of modafinil's actions in wakefulness and
   cognitive enhancement are unknown. The current study aims to further
   examine the effects of modafinil as a cognitive enhancer on
   hippocampus-dependent memory in mice. A high dose of modafinil (75 mg/kg
   ip) given before training improved acquisition On a Morris water maze.
   When given only before testing, modafinil did not affect water maze
   performance. We also examined modafinil (0.075 to 75 mg/kg) on Pavlovian
   fear conditioning. A low dose of pretraining modafinil (0.75 mg/kg)
   enhanced memory of contextual fear conditioning (tested off-drug I week
   later) whereas a high dose (75 mg/kg) disrupted memory. Pretraining
   modafinil did not affect cued conditioning at any dose tested, and
   immediate posttraining modafinil had no effect on either cued or
   contextual fear. These results suggest that modafinil's effects of
   memory are more selective than amphetamine or cocaine and specific to
   hippocampus-dependent memory.}},

Abstract = {{Recent work from our laboratory demonstrates that both young and adult
   rats show a preference for directional responding over place navigation
   in the Morris water task. Based on these findings, previous studies on
   the postnatal development of spatial learning have most likely assessed
   the ontogeny of directional responding instead of true place navigation.
   Here, we examined the development of directional responding and place
   navigation among young male and female rats using two variants of the
   Morris water task that specifically require directional and place
   responses. In the place variant, the hidden platform remained in the
   same absolute spatial location regardless of pool position. In the
   direction variant, the platform remained in the same direction in the
   room regardless of pool position. We found that ability to solve the
   direction task emerged around 20 to 21 days of age, whereas ability to
   solve the place task did not emerge until 26 to 27 clays of age. These
   findings indicate that directional responding and place navigation
   exhibit different developmental trajectories and suggest that the 2
   forms of navigation have different neurobiological bases.}},

Abstract = {{How males and females differ in their use of cues for spatial navigation
   is an important question. Although women and men appear to respond
   differently to close and distant objects, object features and the
   geometry of spaces, the common denominator of these sex-specific cue
   preferences is unknown. By constructing virtual landscapes from either
   directional (graded, gradient) or positional (pinpoint) cues, the
   authors tested the hypothesis that sex differences arise from
   preferences for cues that provide primarily direction or position, as
   predicted by the parallel map model of the cognitive map. Women and men
   learned a target location in the presence of either one or the other
   class of cues. Men were more accurate in estimating the target location
   overall, but the navigation accuracy difference between men and women
   was greater in the presence of directional cues. Our findings provide
   support for the parallel map model and suggest that the previously
   reported male advantage in the presence of distant objects and geometric
   cues derives from their function as directional cues.}},

Abstract = {{The complexity of an animal's physical environment is known to affect
   the hippocampus. Captivity may affect hippocampal anatomy and this may
   be attributable to the limited opportunities for memory-based
   experiences. This has tangential support, in that differential demands
   on memory can mediate changes in the hippocampus. What remains unclear
   is whether captivity directly affects hippocampal architecture and
   whether providing memory-based experiences in captivity can maintain
   hippocampal attributes comparable to wild-caught conspecifics. Using
   food-caching mountain chickadees (Poecile gambeli), we found that
   wild-caught individuals had larger hippocampal volumes relative to the
   rest of the telencephalon than captive birds with or without
   memory-based food-caching experiences, whereas there were no differences
   in neuron numbers or telencephalon volume. Also, there were no
   significant differences in relative hippocampal volume or neuron numbers
   between the captive birds with or without memory-based experiences. Our
   results demonstrate that captivity reduces hippocampal volume relative
   to the remainder of the telencephalon, but not at the expense of neuron
   numbers. Further, memory-based experiences in captivity may not be
   sufficient to maintain hippocampal volume comparable to wild-caught
   counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{Eyeblink conditioning using a conditioned stimulus (CS) from one sensory
   modality (e.g., an auditory CS) is greatly enhanced when the subject is
   previously trained with a CS from a different sensory modality (e.g., a
   visual CS). The enhanced acquisition to the second modality CS results
   from cross modal savings. The current study was designed to examine the
   role of the cerebellum in establishing cross modal savings in eyeblink
   conditioning with rats. In the first experiment rats were given paired
   or unpaired presentations with a CS (tone or light) and an unconditioned
   stimulus. All rats were then given paired training with a different
   modality CS. Only rats given paired training showed cross modal savings
   to the second modality CS. Experiment 2 showed that cerebellar
   inactivation during initial acquisition to the first modality CS
   completely prevented savings when training was switched to the second
   modality CS. Experiment 3 showed that cerebellar inactivation during
   initial cross modal training also prevented savings to the second
   modality stimulus. These results indicate that the cerebellum plays an
   essential role in establishing cross modal savings of eyeblink
   conditioning.}},

Abstract = {{Inhibitory gating (IG) is a basic central nervous system process for
   filtering repetitive sensory information. Although IG deficits coincide
   with cognitive and emotional dysfunction in a variety of
   neuropsychiatric disorders, limited research has been completed on the
   basic, functional nature of IG. Persistent IG occurs in rat prelimbic
   medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a crucial site for modulating emotional
   learning. To investigate the interaction of affect and IG, we recorded
   local field potentials (LFP) directly from prelimbic mPFC and examined
   the influence of tone-shock feat conditioning (FC) on IG. Behavioral
   reactions during IG were observed before and after FC, and increase of
   orienting response after FC indicated induction of tone-shock
   association. After FC, some component,. of LFP response exhibited
   weakening of IG. On a subsequent day of recording, IG strengthened for
   all LFP components, but individual components differed in their
   particular changes. Affective regulation of IG represents air important
   factor influencing within-subject IG variability, and these results have
   implications for understanding the role of rapid, implicit neural coding
   involved in emotional learning and affective disruption in psychiatric
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{Vocal deficits are prevalent and debilitating in Parkinson's disease.
   These deficits may be related to the initial pathology of the
   nigrostriatal dopamine neurons and resulting dopamine depletion, which
   contributes to dysfunction of fine motor control in multiple functions.
   Although vocalization in animals and humans may differ in many respects,
   we evaluated complex (50-kHz) ultrasonic mate calls in 2 rat models of
   Parkinson's disease, including unilateral infusions of 6-hydroxydopamine
   to the medial forebrain bundle and peripheral administration of a
   nonakinesia dose of the dopamine antagonist haloperidol. We examined the
   effects of these treatments on multiple aspects of the acoustic signal.
   The number of trill-like (frequency modulated) 50-kHz calls was
   significantly reduced, and appeared to be replaced by simpler (flat)
   calls. The bandwidth and maximum intensity of simple and
   frequency-modulated calls were significantly decreased, but call
   duration was not. Our findings suggest that the nigrostriatal dopamine
   pathway is involved to some extent in fine sensorimotor function that
   includes USV production and complexity.}},

Abstract = {{The creation of seizure-prone (Fast) and seizure-resistant (Slow) rat
   strains via selective breeding implies genetic control of relative
   seizure vulnerability, yet ample data also advocates an environmental
   contribution. To investigate potential environmental underpinnings to
   the differential seizure sensitivities in these strains, the authors
   compared amygdala kindling profiles in adult male Fast and Slow rats
   raised by (a) their own mother, (b) a foster mother from the same
   strain, or (c) a foster mother from the opposing strain. Ultimately,
   strain-specific kindling profiles were not normalized by
   cross-fostering. Instead, both strains became more seizure-prone
   regardless of maternal affiliation (i.e., cross-fostered groups from
   both strains kindled faster than uncrossed controls). Interhemispheric
   seizure spread was also facilitated in cross-fostered Slow rat groups
   and was associated with increased commissural cross-sectional areas,
   giving them a Fast-like profile. It is important to note, however, that
   all Fast groups remained significantly more seizure-prone than Slow
   groups, suggesting that although tire postnatal environment strongly
   influenced seizure disposition in both strains, it did not wholly
   account for their relative dispositions. Investigation into mechanisms
   fundamental to cross-fostering-induced seizure facilitation should help
   prevent postnatal worsening of pathology in already seizure-prone
   individuals.}},

   environment for 2 hr on 4 separate occasions: while alone, with I female
   cage mate, with the other female cage mate, or with an unfamiliar

Abstract = {{Maternal defense (also known as maternal aggression) is impaired by
   corticotropin-releasing factor(CRF) related peptides. but where these
   peptides inhibit defense is unknown. Lateral septum (LS) gates
   reactivity to stressors, contains receptors to CRF-related peptides, and
   during lactation shows a decreased response to CRF, suggesting LS is a
   key site for regulating maternal aggression. In this study, the authors
   examined the effects of CRF-related peptides in LS on maternal defense.
   LS injections of CRF (0.2 mu g), urocortin (Ucn) 1 (0.2 mu g), and Ucn 3
   (0.25 mu g) all significantly impaired maternal defense behavior.
   However, LS injections of CRF receptor 2 antagonist astressin-2B, but
   not a CRF receptor I antagonist, reversed the inhibitory effects of both
   septal CRF and Ucn 3. After intra-LS injection of peptides, c-Fos
   immunoreactivity was increased in ventromedial hypothalamus, lateral
   hypothalamus, and parabrachial nucleus, identifying these brain regions
   as possible downstream mediators of altered LS activity. Together, these
   findings indicate that CRF-related peptides similarly modulate maternal
   defense via CRF receptor 2, and that LS is a critical site for the
   negative regulation of maternal defense behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Sexually receptive females mount sexually sluggish males to entice them
   to copulate, and estrogen and male olfactory cues mediate this
   female-male mounting (FMM) in the rat. This study examined whether brain
   regions that concentrate steroid hormones and receive olfactory
   projections were important for the mediation of FMM. Fos induction was
   observed within the medial amygdala, medial preoptic area, and
   ventromedial hypothalamus of ovariectomized, hormone-primed rats that
   displayed FMM compared with rats that did not. Excitotoxic lesions of
   those regions eliminated FMM, whereas implants of crystalline estradiol
   benzoate to the ventromedial hypothalamus, but not the medial preoptic
   area or medial amygdala, restored FMM. These data indicate that the
   ventromedial hypothalamus is a critical area of convergence of hormonal,
   olfactory, and somatosensory inputs for FMM.}},

Title = {{Overexpression of Delta FosB Is Associated With Attenuated
   Cocaine-Induced Suppression of Saccharin Intake in Mice}},

Abstract = {{Rodents suppress intake of saccharin when it is paired with a drug of
   abuse (Goudie, Dickins, \& Thornton, 1978; Risinger \& Boyce, 2002). By
   the authors' account, this phenomenon, referred to as reward comparison,
   is thought to be mediated by anticipation of the rewarding properties of
   the drug (P. S. Grigson, 1997; P. S. Grigson \& C. S. Freet, 2000).
   Although a great deal has yet to be discovered regarding the neural
   basis of reward and addiction, it is known that overexpression of Delta
   FosB is associated with an increase in drug sensitization and incentive.
   Given this, the authors reasoned that overexpression of Delta FosB
   should also support greater drug-induced devaluation of a natural
   reward. To test this hypothesis, NSE-tTA x TetOp-Delta FosB mice (Chen
   et al., 1999) with normal or overexpressed Delta FosB in the striatum
   were given access to a saccharin cue and then injected with saline, 10
   mg/kg cocaine, or 20 mg/kg cocaine. Contrary to the original prediction,
   overexpression of Delta FosB was associated with attenuated
   cocaine-induced suppression of saccharin intake. It is hypothesized that
   elevation of Delta FosB not only increases the reward value of drug, but
   the reward value of the saccharin cue as well.}},

Title = {{Gestational Methylmercury Exposure Selectively Increases the Sensitivity

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{123}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{408-417}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Developmental methylmercury (MeHg) exposure alters dopamine
   neurotransmitter systems, but the selectivity of this and the effects of
   low, environmentally relevant MeHg exposure regimens are poorly
   understood. In previous reports, some including littermates of animals
   studied here, chronic, low-level exposures affected performance on
   reversal tasks and enhanced reinforcer efficacy. Using high- and
   low-rate operant behavior under a fixed interval (FI) schedule,
   sensitivity was examined to drugs that target noradrenergic and
   dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems. Female rats were exposed in utero
   to 0, 0.5, or 5 ppm of mercury, as MeHg, via maternal drinking water.
   Selenium (Se) is thought to attenuate MeHg's neurotoxicity, so animals
   consumed a diet containing 0.06 or 0.6 ppm of Se. At I I months,
   they]ever-pressed under a FI 120{''} schedule of sucrose reinforcement.
   Acute dose-effect curves were generated with cocaine, desipramine,
   SKF-38393, quinpirole, SCH-23390, and sulpiride. As compared with
   unexposed animals, those exposed to 5 ppm mercury, regardless of Se
   exposure, were 2 to 3 times more sensitive to the rate-reducing effects
   of high doses of cocaine and did not show increased responding earlier
   in the interval following moderate cocaine doses. Cocaine's effects in
   the 0.5 ppm Hg groups depended on dietary Se: low Se diet resulted in a
   rightward shift in the DEC compared to controls, whereas a high Se diet
   did not. No differential effects of MeHg were seen with the other drugs.
   Gestational MeHg exposure produces irreversible sensitivity to dopamine,
   but not norepinephrine, reuptake inhibitors and not to drugs that target
   D-1 or D-2 receptors.}},

Abstract = {{C57BL/6 mice were given 0.2\% cuprizone (CPZ) for 2 to 6 weeks while
   controls ate the same diet without CPZ. At various time points the
   animals were subjected to behavioral tests and their brains were
   analyzed. Mice exposed to CPZ for 2 and 3 weeks displayed more climbing
   behavior and lower prepulse inhibition, suggesting an increase in
   central nervous system activity and impaired sensorimotor gating. In
   addition, they showed lower activities of monoamine oxidase and dopamine
   beta hydroxylase in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, and had
   higher dopamine but lower norepinephrine levels in the prefrontal
   cortex. Mice exposed to CPZ for 4 to 6 weeks had less social
   interaction, which is an animal correlate of social withdrawal of
   patients with schizophrenia. Also, these CPZ-exposed mice showed evident
   brain demyelination, myelin break down, and loss of oligodendrocytes. At
   all time points the CPZ-exposed mice spent more time in the open arms of
   an elevated plus maze and exhibited spatial working memory impairment.
   These data are in line with evidence from human studies suggesting a
   putative role of white matter abnormality in the pathophysiology of
   schizophrenia.}},

Title = {{A Critical Test of the Overlap Hypothesis for Odor Mixture Perception}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{123}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{430-437}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The overlap hypothesis of mixture perception is based on the observation
   that mixtures of perceptually similar odorants tend to smell different
   from their components (configural), whereas mixtures of dissimilar
   odorants smell like their components (elemental). Because input patterns
   of perceptually similar odorants tend to overlap more than dissimilar
   ones, it has been hypothesized that component pattern overlap can
   predict a mixture's perceptual quality, with high overlap predicting a
   configural response and low overlap an elemental response. The authors
   used 7 pairs of odorants chosen for different degrees of overlap in
   their monomolecular 2-deoxyglucose activation patterns to test the
   theory in a go/no-go behavioral assay that measured generalization from
   binary mixtures to components. The authors show that individual
   component odorant input patterns are not sufficient to predict mixture
   quality, falsifying the overlap hypothesis. An important finding is that
   different odorant pairs with similar glomerular overlap showed opposite
   behavioral-perceptual responses, suggesting nonlinear effects at the
   receptor or glomerular level or the critical involvement of higher order
   areas. Thus, the authors posit that imaging the mixtures themselves may
   provide additional information needed to reliably predict mixture
   quality.}},

Volume = {{123}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{438-442}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type IV (CaMKIV) is
   highly expressed in cerebellar cortical granule cells and deep nuclear
   neurons in the cerebellum. It mediates the phosphorylation and
   activation of the cAMP-dependent response element binding protein
   (CREB). In several paradigms CREB-dependent transcription is required
   for cellular events underlying long-term memory processes. Also, CaMKIV
   deficiency results in impaired long-term depression (LTD) induction in
   cerebellar cortex. To investigate the function of CaMKIV in the
   cerebellum, Wild-type (WT) and CaMKIV KO mice were tested with delay
   eyeblink conditioning. KO and WT mice did not differ in acquisition, but
   the KO mice showed a significantly lower conditioned response (CR)
   percentage than the WT mice in the retention testing and retraining
   period. The CR peak latencies for the two groups did not differ in
   acquisition but were shorter for the KO mice in the testing period. No
   significant differences were found between KO and WT mice in spontaneous
   eyeblink activity, auditory brainstem response (ABR) amplitudes, and
   tail-flick latency. The results suggest an important role for CaMKIV in
   long-term memory in the cerebellum.}},

   (5,7-DHT), into the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), entorhinal cortex
   (EC), or occipital cortex (OccC) of rats to chronically reduce 5-HT
   neurotransmission in these brain areas. The animals were tested for
   anxiety-like behavior on the elevated plus-maze and open field. An 82\%
   depletion of 5-HT from the mPFC increased anxiety-like behavior, while
   no general motor effects were evident. In contrast, a 63\%
   5-HT-depletion of the EC or a 78\% 5-HT-depletion of the OccC did not
   have any effects on emotional or exploratory behaviors. These findings
   are in line with a proposed role of 5-HT in the mPFC in the modulation
   of anxiety- and stress-mediated behavior and demonstrate a functional
   differentiation between different cortical 5-HT projections.}},

Abstract = {{Variability in the constituents of movement is fundamental to adaptive
   motor performance. A sustained decrease in the variability of
   anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) occurs when performing cued arm
   raises following acute, experimentally induced low back pain (LBP;
   Moseley \& Hodges, 2006). This observation implies that these changes in
   variability may also be relevant to people with chronic LBP. To confirm
   that this reduced variability in the timing of APAs is also evident in
   people with chronic LBP, the authors examined the standard deviations of
   electromyographic onset latencies from the bilateral internal oblique
   (IO) and erector spinae muscles (in relation to deltoid muscle onset)
   when 10 people with chronic LBP and 10 People Without LBP performed 75
   trials of rapid arm raises. The participants with LBP exhibited
   significantly less variability of their IO muscle onset latencies,
   confirming that the decreased variability of postural coordination that
   is evident following acutely induced LBP is also evident in people with
   chronic LBP. Thus, people with chronic LBP may be less capable of
   adapting their APAs to ensure postural stability during movement.}},

Abstract = {{Forebrain dopamine (DA) systems are thought to be a critical component
   of the brain circuitry regulating behavioral activation, work output
   during instrumental behavior, and effort-related decision making. Tasks
   that offer animals choices between alternatives that require different
   degrees of effort can be used to assess effort-related choice behavior.
   Rats treated with DA antagonists, or with accumbens DA depletions, tend
   to show reduced selection of instrumental behaviors with high response
   requirements, and instead they choose to engage in food-seeking
   behaviors that involve less effort. The accompanying article by Bardgett
   et al. (2009) describes a novel effort-discounting task that involves
   the modification of a previously developed T-maze choice procedure
   (Salamone et al., 1994). Each arm of the maze contained different
   magnitudes Of food reinforcement, and in order to obtain the higher
   magnitude reward, the rats had to climb a barrier in that arm of the
   maze. With training, rats were able to climb Successively higher
   barriers to obtain the larger amount of Food, and the choice between the
   high barrier arm and the no-barrier arm with the smaller reward served
   as a template for assessing the effects of dopaminergic drugs. D1 and D2
   family antagonists, as well as the DA releasing agent amphetamine, were
   able to produce a bidirectional modulation of choice behavior, while
   drugs that act on D3 receptors were ineffective. These studies
   illustrate features of the neurochemical regulation of effort-related
   decision making, and may have implications for the understanding of both
   natural and pathological features of motivation.}},

Abstract = {{Emerging data on the neural mechanisms of impulse control highlight
   brain regions involved in emotion and decision making, including the
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
   and amygdala. Variation in the development of these regions may
   influence ones propensity for impulsivity and, by extension, ones
   vulnerability to disorders involving low impulse control (e.g. substance
   abuse). Here we test the hypothesis that lower impulse control is
   associated with structural differences in these regions, particularly on
   the right side, in 61 normal healthy boys aged 717. We assessed parent-
   and teacher-reported behavioral ratings of impulse control (motor
   impulsivity and non-planning behavior) in relation to vmPFC, ACC and
   amygdala volume, measured using structural magnetic resonance imaging
   and FreeSurfer. A regression analysis showed that the right vmPFC was a
   significant predictor of impulse control ratings. Follow-up tests showed
   (i) a significant correlation between low impulse control and decreased
   right vmPFC volume, especially the medial sector of the vmPFC and (ii)
   significantly lower right vmPFC volume in a subgroup of 20 impulsive
   boys relative to 20 non-impulsive boys. These results are consistent
   with the notion that right vmPFC provides a neuroanatomical correlate of
   the normal variance in impulse control observed in boys.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to detect and process errors made by others plays an
   important role is many social contexts. The capacity to process errors
   is typically found to rely on sites in the medial frontal cortex.
   However, it remains to be determined whether responses at these sites
   are driven primarily by action errors themselves or by the affective
   consequences normally associated with their commission. Using an
   experimental paradigm that disentangles action errors and the valence of
   their affective consequences, we demonstrate that sites in the medial
   frontal cortex (MFC), including the ventral anterior cingulate cortex
   (vACC) and pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), respond to action
   errors independent of the valence of their consequences. The strength of
   this response was negatively correlated with the empathic concern
   subscale of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index. We also demonstrate a
   main effect of self-identification by showing that errors committed by
   friends and foes elicited significantly different BOLD responses in a
   separate region of the middle anterior cingulate cortex (mACC). These
   results suggest that the way we look at others plays a critical role in
   determining patterns of brain activation during error observation. These
   findings may have important implications for general theories of error
   processing.}},

Abstract = {{To address the neurocognitive mechanisms that underlie choices made
   after receiving information from an anonymous individual, reaction times
   (Experiment 1) and event-related brain potentials (Experiment 2) were
   recorded as participants played three variants of the coin toss game. In
   this game, participants guess the outcomes of unseen coin tosses after a
   person in another room (dubbed the reporter) observes the coin toss
   outcomes and then sends reports (which may or may not be truthful) to
   participants about whether the coins landed on heads or tails.
   Participants knew that the reporters interests were aligned with their
   own (common interests), opposed to their own (conflicting interests) or
   opposed to their own, but that the reporter was penalized every time he
   or she sent a false report about the coin toss outcome (penalty for
   lying). In the common interests and penalty for lying conditions,
   participants followed the reporters reports over 90 of the time, in
   contrast to 59 of the time in the conflicting interests condition.
   Reaction time results indicated that participants took similar amounts
   of time to respond in the common interests and penalty for lying
   conditions and that they were reliably faster than in the conflicting
   interests condition. Event-related potentials timelocked to the
   reporters reports revealed a larger P2, P3 and late positive complex
   response in the common interests condition than in the other two,
   suggesting that participants brains processed the reporters reports
   differently in the common interests condition relative to the other two
   conditions. Results suggest that even when people behave as if they
   trust information, they consider communicative efforts of individuals
   whose interests are aligned with their own to be slightly more
   informative than those of individuals who are made trustworthy by an
   institution, such as a penalty for lying.}},

Abstract = {{It is known that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is crucially involved in
   emotion regulation. However, the specific role of the OFC in controlling
   the behavior evoked by these emotions, such as approachavoidance (AA)
   responses, remains largely unexplored. We measured behavioral and neural
   responses (using fMRI) during the performance of a social task, a
   reaction time (RT) task where subjects approached or avoided visually
   presented emotional faces by pulling or pushing a joystick,
   respectively. RTs were longer for affect-incongruent responses (approach
   angry faces and avoid happy faces) as compared to affect-congruent
   responses (approachhappy; avoidangry). Moreover, affect-incongruent
   responses recruited increased activity in the left lateral OFC. These
   behavioral and neural effects emerged only when the subjects responded
   explicitly to the emotional value of the faces (AA-task) and largely
   disappeared when subjects responded to an affectively irrelevant feature
   of the faces during a control (gender evaluation: GE) task. Most
   crucially, the size of the OFC-effect correlated positively with the
   size of the behavioral costs of approaching angry faces. These findings
   qualify the role of the lateral OFC in the voluntary control of
   socialmotivational behavior, emphasizing the relevance of this region
   for selecting rule-driven stimulusresponse associations, while
   overriding automatic (affect-congruent) stimulusresponse mappings.}},

Abstract = {{The neural correlates of cognitive control and social processing
   functions, as well as the characteristic patterns of anomalous brain
   activation patterns in psychiatric conditions associated with impairment
   in these functions, have been well characterized. However, these domains
   have primarily been examined in isolation. The present study used
   event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to map brain areas
   recruited during a target-detection task designed to evaluate responses
   to both non-social (i.e. shape) and social (i.e. face) target stimuli.
   Both shape and face targets activated a similar brain network, including
   the postcentral gyrus, the anterior and posterior cingulate gyri and the
   right midfrontal gyrus, whereas face targets additionally activated the
   thalamus, fusiform and temporooccipital cortex, lingual gyrus and
   paracingulate gyrus. Comparison of activations to social and non-social
   target events revealed that a small portion of the dorsal anterior
   cingulate gyrus (Brodmann's area 32) and the supracalcarine cortex were
   preferentially activated to face targets. These findings indicate that
   non-social and social stimuli embedded within a cognitive control task
   activate overlapping and distinct brain regions. Clinical cognitive
   neuroscience research of disorders characterized by cognitive
   dysfunction and impaired social processing would benefit from the use of
   tasks that evaluate the combined effects of deficits in these two
   domains.}},

Abstract = {{Although there is evidence of emotion perception deficits in autism
   spectrum disorder (ASD), research on this topic has been mostly confined
   to perception of emotions in faces. Using behavioral measures and 3T
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined whether such
   deficits extend to the perception of bodily expressed emotions. We found
   that individuals with ASD, in contrast to neurotypical (NT) individuals,
   did not exhibit a differential pattern of brain activation to bodies
   expressing fear as compared with emotionally neutral bodies. ASD and NT
   individuals showed similar patterns of activation in response to bodies
   engaged in emotionally neutral actions, with the exception of decreased
   activation in the inferior frontal cortex and the anterior insula in
   ASD. We discuss these findings in relation to possible abnormalities in
   a network of cortical and subcortical mechanisms involved in social
   orienting and emotion contagion. Our data suggest that emotion
   perception deficits in ASD may be due to compromised processing of the
   emotional component of observed actions.}},

Abstract = {{Neurobiological evidence implicates the amygdala as well as serotonergic
   (serotonin, 5-HT) signaling via postsynaptic 5-HT2A receptors as
   essential substrates of anxiety behaviors. Assuming a functional
   interdependence of these substrates, we hypothesized that a low-fear
   behavioral phenotype due to bilateral lesion of the amygdala would be
   associated with significant 5-HT2A receptor changes. Thus, we used
   {[}F-18]altanserin positron emission tomography (PET) referenced to
   radioligand plasma levels and corrected for partial volume effects to
   quantify the spatial distribution of 5-HT2A receptor binding potential
   (BPP) in a rare patient with UrbachWiethe disease and selective
   bilateral amygdala calcification damage relative to 10 healthy control
   subjects. Consistent with our a priori hypothesis, we observed a 70
   global decrease in 5-HT2A receptor BPP in the UrbachWiethe patient
   relative to controls. Thus, brain abnormalities in this patient are not
   restricted to the amygdala, but extend to overall 5-HT neurotransmission
   via 5-HT2A receptors. Our findings provide important insights into the
   molecular architecture of human anxiety behaviors and suggest the 5-HT2A
   receptor as a promising pharmacological target to control pathological
   anxiety.}},

Abstract = {{Despite increases in the human life span, people have not increased
   their rate of saving. In a phenomenon known as temporal discounting,
   people value immediate gains over future gains. According to a future
   self-continuity hypothesis, individuals perceive and treat the future
   self differently from the present self, and so might fail to save for
   their future. Neuroimaging offers a novel means of testing this
   hypothesis, since previous research indicates that self- vs
   other-judgments elicit activation in the rostral anterior cingulate
   (rACC). Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, we
   predicted and found not only individual differences in rACC activation
   while rating the current vs future self, but also that individual
   differences in current vs future self activation predicted temporal
   discounting assessed behaviorally a week after scanning. In addition to
   supporting the future self-continuity hypothesis, these findings hold
   implications for significant financial decisions, such as choosing
   whether to save for the future or spend in the present.}},

Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{The behavioral phenotype characteristic of Williams syndrome (WS) is
   marked by strong interest in social interaction, manifested in attention
   to human faces, empathy, approach behavior and social disinhibition,
   often coexisting with generalized anxiety. Despite their heightened
   social interest, people with WS show deficits in explicit emotion
   recognition tasks similar to those of people with other developmental
   disabilities. In the current study we explored whether individuals with
   WS show distinctive autonomic responsiveness to social-emotional
   information, using skin conductance response and heart rate measures.
   Autonomic activation was investigated in response to facial expressions
   of emotion in adolescents and adults with WS, compared to age-matched
   normal controls and to age-, IQ- and language-matched individuals with
   learning or intellectual disabilities (LID). Overall participants with
   WS were less electrodermally responsive to dynamically presented face
   stimuli than the age- and IQ-matched LID group, and showed more heart
   rate deceleration when viewing emotional faces than the controls. These
   findings, indicating hypoarousal but increased interest in response to
   the dynamic presentation of facial emotions in WS, are consistent with
   the behavioral profile of high approachability toward social stimuli in
   this population.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional statistical analysis methods for functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) data are very successful at detecting brain
   regions that are activated as a whole during specific mental activities.
   The overall activation of a region is usually taken to indicate
   involvement of the region in the task. However, such activation analysis
   does not consider the multivoxel patterns of activity within a brain
   region. These patterns of activity, which are thought to reflect
   neuronal population codes, can be investigated by pattern-information
   analysis. In this framework, a regions multivariate pattern information
   is taken to indicate representational content. This tutorial
   introduction motivates pattern-information analysis, explains its
   underlying assumptions, introduces the most widespread methods in an
   intuitive way, and outlines the basic sequence of analysis steps.}},

Abstract = {{Although the temporal characteristics of neural responses have been
   proposed as a mechanism for sensory neural coding, there has been little
   evidence thus far that this type of information is actually used by the
   nervous system. Here the authors show that patterned electrical pulses
   trains that mimic the response to the taste of quinine can produce a
   bitterlike sensation when delivered to the nucleus tractus solitarius of
   behaving rats. Following conditioned aversion training using either
   ``quinine simulation{''} patterns of electrical stimulation or natural
   quinine (0.1 mM) as a conditioned stimulus, rats specifically
   generalized the aversion to 2 bitter tastants: quinine and urea.
   Randomization of the quinine simulation patterns resulted in
   generalization patterns that resembled those to a perithreshold
   concentration (0.01 mM) of quinine. These data provide strong evidence
   that the temporal pattern of brainstem activity may convey information
   about taste quality and underscore the functional significance of
   temporal coding.}},

Abstract = {{Sensory representations depend strongly on the descending regulation of
   perceptual processing. Generalization among similar stimuli is a
   fundamental cognitive process that defines the extent of the variance in
   physical stimulus properties that becomes categorized together and
   associated with a common contingency, thereby establishing units of
   meaning. The olfactory system provides an experimentally tractable model
   system in which to study the interactions of these physical and
   psychological factors within the framework of their underlying
   neurophysiological mechanisms. The authors here show that olfactory
   associative learning systematically regulates gradients of odor
   generalization. Specifically, increasing odor-reward pairings, odor
   concentration, or reward quality-each a determinant of associative
   learning-significantly transformed olfactory generalization gradients,
   each narrowing the range of variance in odor quality perceived as likely
   to share the learned contingency of a conditioned odor stimulus.
   However, differences in the qualitative features of these three
   transformations suggest that these different determinants of learning
   are not necessarily theoretically interchangeable. These results
   demonstrate that odor representations are substantially shaped by
   experience and descending influences.}},

Volume = {{123}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Animals sample sensory stimuli for longer periods when they must perform
   difficult discrimination tasks, implying that the brain's ability to
   represent stimuli improves as a function of time. Although it is true in
   other senses, few studies have examined whether increasing sampling time
   improves olfactory discrimination. In the experiments reported here,
   odor sampling time was controlled with the goal of testing whether odor
   concentration affected a honeybee's ability to learn, recognize, and
   discriminate odors. Increasing sampling time during conditioning and
   testing improved a honeybee's ability to learn, recognize, and
   differentiate low-concentration (0.0002 M) odors. For
   intermediate-concentration (0.02 M) odors, both acquisition and
   recognition improved when stimulus duration was longer, but
   discrimination was unaffected. Having longer to sample a
   high-concentration (2.0 M) stimulus also improved ability to recognize
   or differentiate odors. Differences in time to acquisition, but it did
   not affect the respond to the conditioned and novel odors during the
   test period depended on the difficulty of the discrimination task. The
   results suggest that the sensory coding of molecular identity takes
   longer for low-concentration odors.}},

Volume = {{123}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Two experiments examined the effect of the noncompetitive NMDA receptor
   antagonist, dizocilpine maleate (MK-801), on spatial working memory
   during development. Rats were trained on spatial delayed alternation
   (SDA) in a T-maze after ip administration of 0.06 mg/kg MK-801, 0.1
   mg/kg MK-801, or saline on postnatal days (P) P23 and P33 (Experiment
   1), or following bilateral intrahippocampal administration of 2.5 or 5.0
   mu g per side MK-801 or saline on P26 (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1,
   MK-801 dose-dependently impaired SDA learning at both ages. Because the
   same doses of systemic MK-801 have no effect on T-maze position
   discrimination learning, impairment of SDA by MK-801 likely reflects
   disruption of spatial working memory. Both doses of MK-801 abolished
   acquisition of SDA performance in Experiment 2. Disruption of
   hippocampal plasticity may account for the effects produced by systemic
   MK-801 administration. These results confirm and extend earlier lesion
   studies by implicating plasticity of hippocampal neurons in the ontogeny
   of spatial delayed alternation.}},

Abstract = {{In previous studies the cerebellar interpositus (IP) nucleus, but not
   the hippocampus, was shown to be necessary both for initial learning and
   retention and for long-term retention of the standard delay eyeblink
   conditioned response (CR). However, in the trace eyeblink CR procedure,
   the hippocampus is also necessary for initial learning and retention,
   but not for long-term retention. Here the authors evaluate the role of
   the IP nucleus in both initial learning and retention, and in long-term
   retention of the trace eyeblink CR, using muscimol infusion to
   reversibly inactivate the IP nucleus. For the short-term study, there
   were two subgroups, the first sequentially passed through acquisition,
   inactivation, and reacquisition phases, whereas the second subgroup went
   through inactivation, acquisition, and inactivation phases. For the
   long-term study, the rabbits acquired the CR and then rested for a
   month. Next, they were distributed into two subgroups: with or without
   retention training, and finally went through inactivation and
   reacquisition phases. The results showed that the prelearning IP nucleus
   inactivation prevented the acquisition of the trace CR, whereas the
   postlearning inactivation reversibly abolished the expression of both
   the short- and long-term CR.}},

Abstract = {{The role of the cerebellar cortex in eyeblink classical conditioning
   remains unclear. Experimental manipulations that disrupt the normal
   function impair learning to various degrees, and task parameters may be
   important factors in determining the severity of impairment. This study
   examined the role of cerebellar cortex in eyeblink conditioning under
   conditioned stimulus-unconditioned stimulus intervals known to be
   optimal or nonoptimal for learning. Using infusions of picrotoxin to the
   interpositus nucleus of the rabbit cerebellum, the authors
   pharmacologically disrupted input from the cerebellar cortex while
   training with an interstimulus interval (ISI)-switch procedure. One
   group of rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) was 1st trained with a 250-ms
   ISI (optimal) and then switched to a 750-ms ISI (nonoptimal). A 2nd
   group was trained in the opposite order. The most striking effect was
   that picrotoxin-treated rabbits initially trained with a 250-ms ISI
   learned comparably to controls, but those initially trained with a
   750-ms ISI were severely impaired. These results suggest that functional
   input from cerebellar cortex becomes increasingly important for the
   interpositus nucleus to learn delay eyeblink conditioning as the ISI
   departs from an optimal interval.}},

Abstract = {{Six experiments studied the role of GABA(A) receptor activation in

Abstract = {{The modulatory role of the cerebellum was investigated in a case with

   involved localizing a target and ignoring a distractor appearing either
   before, at the same time as, or after the target. It allowed us to
   assess reactivity to warning signals, distraction, and reactivity to
   signals appearing during attentive processing. Compared with a control
   sample, the patient exhibited greater reactivity to warning signals and
   difficulties interrupting attentive processing, whereas distraction was
   not increased. Complementary analyses showed that these deficits did not
   reflect just delayed development of attentional processes. These results
   suggest that the cerebellum modulates responsiveness and commands
   attentional/exploratory flexibility in response to sensory signals.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research examining Pavlovian appetitive conditioning has extended
   the associative properties of nicotine from the unconditioned stimulus
   or reward to include the role of a conditional stimulus (CS), capable of
   acquiring the ability to evoke a conditioned response. To date,
   published research has used presession extravascular injections to
   examine nicotine as a contextual CS in that appetitive Pavlovian drug
   discrimination task. Two studies in the current research examined
   whether a nicotine CS can function discretely, multiple times within a
   session using passive iv infusions. In Experiment 1, rats readily
   acquired a discrimination in conditioned responding between nicotine and
   saline infusions when nicotine was selectively paired with sucrose
   presentation,;. In Experiment 2, rats were either trained with nicotine
   paired with sucrose or explicitly Impaired with sucrose. The results
   showed that rats trained with explicitly unpaired nicotine and sucrose
   did not increase clipper entries after the infusions. Nicotine was
   required to be reliably paired with sucrose for control of conditioned
   responding to develop. Implications of these findings are discussed in
   relation to tobacco addiction, learning theory, and pharmacology.}},

Abstract = {{The hippocampus (HC) has been suggested to play a role in transitive
   inference (TI) on an ordered sequence of stimuli. However, it has
   remained unclear whether HC is involved in the expression of TI, or
   rather contributes to TI through its role in the acquisition of the
   sequence of elements (Frank, Rudy, \& O'Reilly, 2003). Presently, the
   authors compared the effects of excitotoxic dorsal HC lesions in C57BL
   mice that received surgery before or after they were trained to
   discriminate between pairs of visual stimuli. Performance on a
   subsequent TI task was worse in mice with pretraining lesions than in
   those with posttraining lesions, which showed similar performance to
   shams without lesions. This indicates that HC is not involved in the
   expression of TI, but may merely help to acquire the underlying
   representations required for TI.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The present study examines 2 factors that might moderate the
   object-recognition deficit seen after perirhinal cortex damage. Object
   recognition by normal rats was improved by extending (from 4 to 8 min)
   the sample period during which an object was first explored.
   Furthermore, there was a significant positive correlation between time
   spent in close exploration of the sample object and degree of successful
   novelty discrimination. In contrast, rats with perirhinal cortex lesions
   failed to benefit from increased close exploration and did not
   discriminate the novel object after even the longest sample period.
   Nevertheless, the lesions did not disrupt habituation across repeated
   exposure to the same object. The second factor was extent of perirhinal
   cortex damage. A significant correlation was found between total
   perirhinal cortex loss and degree of recognition impairment. Within the
   perirhinal cortex, only damage to the caudal perirhinal cortex
   correlated significantly with recognition memory deficits. This study
   highlights the critical importance of the perirhinal cortex within the
   temporal lobe for recognition memory and shows that the lesion-induced
   deficit occurs despite seemingly normal levels of close object
   exploration.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{123}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The role of corticostriatal circuits in hierarchical pattern perception
   was examined in Parkinson's disease. The hypothesis was tested that
   patients with right-side onset of motor symptoms (RPD, left hemisphere
   dysfunction) would be impaired at local level processing because the
   left posterior temporoparietal junction (TP) emphasizes processing of
   local information. By contrast, left-side onset patients (LPD; right
   hemisphere dysfunction) would show impaired global processing because
   right TP emphasizes global processing, Participants identified targets
   at local or global levels without and with attention biased toward those
   levels. Despite normal attentional control between levels, LPD patients
   showed a single dissociation, demonstrating abnormal global level
   processing tinder all conditions, whereas RPD patients showed abnormal
   local level processing mainly when attention was biased toward the local
   level. These findings link side of motor symptom onset to visuospatial
   cognitive abilities that depend upon the contralateral TP, highlighting
   that side of onset can predict visuospatial impairments, and provide
   evidence that an inferior parietal-basal ganglia pathway involving the
   caudate head and the hemi-spherically asymmetrical TP region is
   necessary for hierarchical pattern perception.}},

Abstract = {{Posttrial administration of corticosterone was previously shown to
   enhance Consummatory successive negative contrast (cSNC) in rats. The
   present series of experiments provides additional information that helps
   determine the boundaries of this effect. Posttrial corticosterone
   administration (1) enhances cSNC when rats experience a large downshift
   (32\% to 4\% sucrose), but not after a small downshift (8\% to 4\%
   sucrose; Experiment 1); (2) has no effect in an anticipatory negative
   contrast situation in which 4\% sucrose precedes 32\% sucrose in daily
   trials (Experiment 2); (3) does not support the development of a
   conditioned taste aversion to 4\% sucrose, in the absence of an
   incentive downshift (Experiment 3); and (4) facilitates the extinction
   of consummatory behavior (Experiment 4). These results suggest that
   corticosterone facilitates the encoding of an egocentric aversive memory
   of the incentive downshift experience.}},

Abstract = {{The tegmental pedunculopontine nucleus (TPP) of the midbrain is critical
   in mediating the acute rewarding effects of opiates. However, the
   circuitry and neurochemistry underlying this effect has not been
   determined. Here we identify TPP receptors and cell types involved in
   systemic morphine reward and suggest an anatomical and neurochemical
   model for reward in the TPP, Simple hypothetical anatomical models for
   serial cell arrangements and receptors in the TPP were proposed and
   predictions of behavioral outcome (reward or no reward) then were made,
   based on the administration of agonists and antagonist,; directly into
   the TPP of rats. We report that TPP-administered NMDA produced rewarding
   effects, although GABA agonists and antagonists had no motivational
   effects on their own, However, the NMDA receptor antagonist AP-7 and the
   GABA-B receptor antagonist saclofen, while having no motivational
   effects, on their own, blocked systemic morphine reward as measured by
   conditioned place preference. These results provide positive evidence
   for GABA-B and glutamate synapses in the TPP, which mediates systemic
   morphine reward and suggest that I serial pathway for morphine reward in
   the TPP is unlikely.}},

Abstract = {{Fischer and Lewis rat strains often serve as animal vulnerability models
   for drug abuse and addiction. When these strains respond for drugs of
   abuse, several measures, including total drug intake, response rate and
   progressive-ratio breakpoints, have been reported to be
   strain-dependent, a result Suggesting genetic differences in drug
   reactivity and vulnerability. The present study extends these strain
   comparisons to a previously untested measure-demand analysis. In
   Experiment 1, four Fischer and four Lewis rats earned their daily food
   ration by lever pressing under a fixed-ratio schedule, the size of which
   was increased every three sessions from 3 to 1,000 in logarithmic steps.
   Consumption was plotted as a function of ratio size, and modeled by the
   exponential-demand equation (Hursh \& Silberberg, 2009). Experiment 2
   replicated Experiment I except that different rats were used, and
   cocaine reinforced lever pressing. A between-experiment comparison
   showed a commodity-by-strain interaction: Fischer rats defended
   consumption with greater vigor when cocaine served as the reinforcer
   than did Lewis rats; for food, this relation was reversed, However, for
   both strains, defense of consumption of food exceeded that of cocaine.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous rat strains appear to be particularly sensitive to the
   sedative effects of ethanol as adults and insensitive to ethanol's
   stimulant effects. Recently, the authors found that ethanol induces
   stimulant effects in preweanling Sprague-Dawley rats. In adult mice,
   these effects seem to be governed by the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic
   pathway, which can be modulated by means of GABA B agonist (baclofen) or
   opioid antagonist (naloxone) treatments. This study tested whether these
   pharmacological treatments might reduce the activating effect of ethanol
   in preweanling Sprague-Dawley rats. Twelve-day-old pups given naloxone
   (Experiment 1A) or baclofen (Experiment 1B) before ethanol
   administration were tested in terms of locomotor activity in a novel
   environment. Naloxone and baclofen significantly reduced the stimulating
   effect of ethanol but had no effect on locomotor activity patterns in
   water-treated controls. Blood ethanol levels were not affected by
   naloxone or baclofen (Experiment 2). During the preweanling period,
   opioid and GABA B receptors seem to be involved in the stimulating
   effect of ethanol.}},

Abstract = {{Gene-environment interactions are known to play a major role in the
   ethiopathology of several neuropsychiatric disorders, including
   Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study investigates whether
   environmental manipulations, that is, social isolation, may affect the
   genetic predisposition to develop AD-related traits in a triple
   transgenic mouse model (3 X Tg-AD), as suggested by our previous study
   employing physical exercise (Pietropaolo et al., 2008). Mutant and wild
   type mice of both sexes were housed singly or in groups from weaning,
   and evaluated behaviorally at 6 to 7 months of age. Independent of sex,
   the 3 X Tg-AD genotype was associated with enhanced acoustic startle
   response, improved performance in the cued version of the water maze and
   a clear impairment in the Y maze. Notably, the female (but not male)
   mutant mice showed increased anxiety. Although social isolation was
   effective in modifying several behaviors, it did not exacerbate any of
   the AD-like symptoms. Our findings demonstrated the differential
   susceptibility of the 3 X Tg-AD mouse line to environmental
   manipulations, showing that social isolation did not induce remarkable
   effects on the genetically determined AD-like symptoms, in contrast to
   what previously observed with physical exercise.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the authors demonstrate that rats with n-3 fatty acid
   deficiency display spatial learning deficits in the Barnes circular
   maze. Dams were deprived of n-3 fatty acids during pregnancy and
   lactation, and their offspring were weaned to the same deficient diet.
   There was a 58\% loss of brain docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the n-3
   fatty acid-deficient rats in comparison to n-3 fatty acid-adequate rats.
   At 8 weeks of age, deficient rats demonstrated moderate impairment in
   Barnes maze performance compared with the n-3 fatty acid-adequate rats
   during the initial training. In the reversal learning task, the n-3
   fatty acid-deficient rats showed a profound deficit in performance: They
   required more time to find a new position of the escape tunnel, which
   was accompanied by a higher number of errors and perseverations. The n-3
   fatty acid-deficient rats had reduced tissue levels of dopamine in the
   ventral striatum and enhanced levels of the metabolite
   3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in frontal cortex and hypothalamus. In
   summary, this study demonstrates that rats with low brain DHA have a
   deficit in spatial reversal learning that could be related to changes in
   dopamine transmission in critical brain circuits.}},

   coefficients of variation (standard deviation/mean) tended to be larger
   for shorter ISIs. For all ISIs, the absolute timing of the NM movements
   covaried with magnitude. The smaller movements (approximately,.11-.50
   mm) were highly variable, and their peaks tended to occur well after the
   time of US delivery. The larger movements (>.50 mm) were less variable,

Abstract = {{Distal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (dMCAo), which closely
   mimics human stroke, is one of the most used animal models. However,
   although assessment of histological and functional outcome is

   excluded because of the high difficulties to estimate, especially in
   mice, behavioral impairments. The aim of our study was to deeply screen
   functional consequences of distal permanent MCAo in mice to target
   relevant behaviors for future studies. A set of sensorimotor and
   cognitive tests were performed during 3 weeks postsurgery in 2 groups of
   mice. Afterward, brain infarctions were estimated by histological
   staining or magnetic resonance imaging. Overall, while no long-term
   functional impairments could be detected, the adhesive removal was the
   only test showing a deficit. Interestingly, this sensorimotor impairment
   was correlated to cortical damage 3 weeks after surgery. In conclusion,
   despite the fact that dMCAo-induced deficits could not be evidenced by
   most of our behavioral tests, the authors showed that the adhesive
   removal test was the only one, sensitive enough, to highlight a
   long-term deficit. This result suggests therefore that this mouse model
   of ischemia is relevant to efficiently assess therapeutic strategies
   with histological but also behavioral analysis, provided that relevant
   tests are used.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral data supports the commonsense view that babies elicit
   different responses than adults do. Behavioral research also has
   supported the babyface overgeneralization hypothesis that the adaptive
   value of responding appropriately to babies produces a tendency for
   these responses to be over-generalized to adults whose facial structure
   resembles babies. Here we show a neural substrate for responses to
   babies and babyface overgeneralization in the amygdala and the fusiform
   face area (FFA). Both regions showed greater percentage BOLD signal
   change compared with fixation when viewing faces of babies or babyfaced
   men than maturefaced men. Viewing the first two categories also yielded
   greater effective connectivity between the two regions. Facial qualities
   previously shown to elicit strong neural activation could not account
   for the effects. Babyfaced men were distinguished only by their
   resemblance to babies. The preparedness to respond to infantile facial
   qualities generalizes to babyfaced men in perceivers' neural responses
   just as it does in their behavioral reactions.}},

Abstract = {{Self-regulation of intention formation is pivotal for achieving behavior
   change. Fantasy realization theory (Oettingen, 2000) assumes that
   mentally contrasting a desired positive future with present negative
   reality turns high expectations of success into strong intentions to
   realize the desired future, while indulging in the positive future fails
   to do so. The present study tests the theory's process assumption that
   mental contrasting is a cognitively demanding, purposeful
   problem-solving strategy involving working and episodic memory, whereas
   indulging is a mindless daydreaming strategy involving the free flow of
   thought, by investigating the neural correlates of the two strategies
   via continuous magnetoencephalographic (MEG) activity. We observed
   greater activity during mental contrasting (but not indulging) compared
   to resting in prefrontal, frontal, parietal, and temporal areas,
   indicating that mental contrasting involves strong intention formation,
   working memory, and episodic memory. In addition, heightened activity of
   occipital areas was observed during mental contrasting compared to
   resting and indulging, suggesting that mental contrasting, more than
   indulging and resting, entails purposefully creating mental images.
   Taken together, these findings indicate that mental contrasting is
   indeed a purposeful problem-solving strategy based on past performance
   history, whereas indulging is a purposeless daydreaming strategy that is
   oblivious to past experiences.}},

Abstract = {{The immediate early gene zenk encodes transcriptional regulators and is
   believed to be one of the first steps in the formation of long-term
   memories associated with a given stimulus. In this study, we
   investigated the expression of ZENK protein product in brain regions
   that are likely involved in the processing of social stimuli, such as a
   potential mate. Male pigeons (Columba livia) were exposed to one of the
   following: (1) a live female pigeon, (2) a video playback of a female
   pigeon, (3) a video playback of a female cockatoo, or (4) an empty
   stimulus chamber. The brains were then processed immunohistochemically
   using an antibody against ZENK protein. When the stimulus was a live
   pigeon compared to all other stimuli, there were more numerous and more
   darkly-stained ZENK-positive cells in three ``association{''} regions of
   the telencephalon: the hyperpallium apicale, the lateral portion of the
   intermediate nidopallium, and the medial nidopallium. There were no
   significant differences among the video-playback stimuli. The results
   suggest that the level of ZENK expression in these ``association{''}
   regions was influenced not only by the visual presence of a potential
   mate, but by the presence of non-visual signals, the quality of the
   image, and the real-time interaction with the stimulus.}},

Abstract = {{The ratio of the length of the second and fourth digits (2D:4D ratio) is

   heterosexual and right-handed, in Beijing, China. In men, we also
   measured salivary testosterone levels. As predicted, men displayed
   significantly smaller 2D:4D ratios than women (p < .0001. in both
   hands). Within each sex, however, 213:413 ratios, measures of masculine

Abstract = {{The popular drug 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ``Ecstasy{''},
   ``the Love Drug{''}) produces feelings of love and closeness in humans
   and induces analogous prosocial and antiaggressive effects in laboratory
   animals. Here we examined the specific brain regions that may be
   involved in these prosocial effects. Male Wistar rats were pretreated
   with a moderate dose of MDMA (5 mg/kg) or vehicle and then either kept
   alone in a familiar test chamber for 60 min (groups MDMA-ALONE and
   VEHICLE-ALONE) or allowed to engage in social interaction in the
   familiar test chamber with an unfamiliar same-sex conspecific for 60 min
   (groups MDMA-SOCIAL and VEHICLE-SOCIAL). Rats in the MDMA-SOCIAL group
   showed much greater overall social interaction than rats in the
   VEHICLE-SOCIAL group, with microanalysis revealing increased general
   investigation of other rats but decreased anogenital sniffing. Analysis
   of neural activation across 39 brain regions using Fos
   immunohistochemistry showed the following results: (1) VEHICLE-SOCIAL
   and VEHICLE-ALONE groups did not differ in Fos expression, indicating
   that a social context per se did not affect Fos expression, (2)
   MDMA-treated groups showed significantly increased Fos expression
   relative to VEHICLE treated groups in 30 brain regions, (3) the
   MDMA-SOCIAL group showed augmented Fos expression relative to the
   MDMA-ALONE group in six brain regions including the caudate-putamen
   (medial), medial preoptic area, paraventricular thalamic nucleus,
   central amygdala, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, and the medial
   amygdala (posterodorsal), and (4) the MDMA-SOCIAL group (but not the
   MDMA-ALONE group) showed augmented Fos expression relative to the
   VEHICLE groups in the nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area and
   periaqueductal grey. These results indicate that a moderate dose of MDMA
   given in a social context causes considerably greater brain activation
   than the same dose given to solitary rats. This activation involves
   specific neural circuits that are known to regulate affiliative
   behavior, perhaps by modulating the incentive value of social stimuli. A
   possible role for the neuropeptide oxytocin in mediating the prosocial
   effects of MDMA is discussed.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{One of the cardinal mental faculties of humans and other primates is
   social brain function, the collective name assigned to the distributed
   system of social cognitive processes that Orchestrate our sophisticated
   adaptive social behavior. These must include processes for recognizing
   current social context and maintaining an internal representation of the
   current social state as a reference for decision-making. But how and
   where the brain processes such social-state information is unknown. To
   home in on the neural substrates of social-state representation, the
   activity of 196 prefrontal (PFC) neurons was recorded from two monkeys
   simultaneously during a food-grab task under varying social conditions.
   Of PFC neurons, 39\% showed activity modulation during movement-free
   periods and seemed to be representing current social state. The
   direction of modulation was opposite between the dominant and submissive
   monkeys: During social engagement, PFC activity increased in the
   dominant monkey and was suppressed in the submissive monkey. The
   modulation was consistently observed in additional PFC neurons (27/72)
   in additional pairings with two other monkeys. Notably, PFC activity in
   one formerly submissive monkey switched to dominant modulation mode when
   he was paired with a new monkey of lower social status. These findings
   suggest that PFC, as part of a larger social brain network, maintains a
   multistate classification of social context for use as a behavioral
   reference for social decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the effects of interpersonal similarity on vicarious
   error processing. We predicted that high similarity between self and
   other would predict increased neural responsiveness to the other's
   errors, based on the assumption that experience is more strongly shared
   when it involves similar others. Participants observed a confederate
   performing a flanker task while event-related brain potentials were
   recorded from the observer. Physiological data revealed two
   error-related potentials, the observational error-related negativity
   (oERN) and positivity (oPe). Self-reports of perceived similarity toward
   the confederate predicted both components. Participants reporting higher
   interpersonal similarity showed a larger oPe response to the other's
   errors, suggesting increased salience of errors committed by similar
   others. Unexpectedly, higher similarity also predicted a decreased oERN
   response. Divergent results for oERN and oPe may reflect the different
   functional roles of the two components. Together the results demonstrate
   that vicarious error monitoring is sensitive to social factors.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies provide support for the role of the fusiform gyrus in face
   recognition and its sensitivity to emotional expressions. Recently,
   category-specific representation was also observed for neutral human
   bodies in the middle temporal/middle occipital gyrus (extrastriate body
   area) but it is not clear whether this area is also sensitive to
   emotional bodily expressions. Besides these areas, other regions that
   process the affective information carried by the face and the body may
   be common and/or specific to the face or the body. To clarify these
   issues we performed a systematic comparison of how the whole brain
   processes faces and bodies and how their affective information is
   represented. Participants categorized emotional facial and bodily
   expressions while brain activity was measured using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging. Our results show that, first, the amygdala and the
   fusiform gyrus are sensitive to recognition of facial and bodily fear
   signals. Secondly, the extrastriate body area-area V5/MT is specifically
   involved in processing bodies without being sensitive to the emotion
   displayed. Thirdly, other important areas such as the superior temporal
   sulcus, the parietal lobe and subcortical structures represent
   selectively facial and bodily expressions. Finally, some face/body
   differences in activation are a function of the emotion expressed.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the temporal dynamics of brain function contributes to
   models of learning and memory as well as the processing of emotions and
   habituation. In this article, we present a novel analysis technique to
   investigate spatiotemporal patterns of activation in response to blocked
   presentations of emotional stimuli. We modeled three temporal response
   functions (TRFs), which were maximally sensitive to the onset, early or
   sustained temporal component of a given block type. This analysis
   technique was applied to a data set of 29 subjects who underwent
   functional magnetic resonance imaging while responding to fearful,
   happy, and sad facial expressions. We identified brain regions that
   uniquely fit each of the three TRFs for each emotional condition and
   compared the results to the standard approach, which was based on the
   canonical hemodynamic response function. We found that voxels within the
   precuneus fit the onset TRF but did not fit the early or the sustained
   TRF in all the emotional conditions. On the other hand, voxels within
   the amygdala fit the sustained TRF, but not the onset or early TRF,
   during presentation of fearful stimuli, suggesting a spatiotemporal
   dissociation between these structures. This technique provides
   researchers with an additional tool in order to investigate the temporal
   dynamics of neural circuits.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},

Pages = {{135-152}},
Abstract = {{This study used fMRI to investigate the functioning of the Theory of
   Mind (ToM) cortical network in autism during the viewing of animations
   that in some conditions entailed the attribution of a mental state to
   animated geometric figures. At the cortical level, mentalizing
   (attribution of metal states) is underpinned by the coordination and
   integration of the components of the ToM network, which include the
   medial frontal gyrus, the anterior paracingulate, and the right
   temporoparietal junction. The pivotal new finding was a functional
   underconnectivity (a lower degree of synchronization) in autism,
   especially in the connections between frontal and posterior areas during
   the attribution of mental states. In addition, the frontal ToM regions
   activated less in participants with autism relative to control
   participants. In the autism group, an independent psychometric
   assessment of ToM ability and the activation in the right
   temporoparietal junction were reliably correlated. The results together
   provide new evidence for the biological basis of atypical processing of
   ToM in autism, implicating the underconnectivity between frontal regions
   and more posterior areas.}},

Title = {{Positive and negative gaze perception in autism spectrum conditions}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{153-164}},
Abstract = {{Eyes are key social features providing a wealth of information about the
   attention, interest, emotion, and intention of others. Humans are
   typically very adept at detecting gaze direction, but there is a large
   decrement in gaze discrimination ability when eye images change from
   positive to negative polarity. This is thought to show an expert system
   for gaze perception that applies a contrast-specific heuristic to
   determine where someone else is looking. Autism spectrum conditions
   (ASC) are characterized by social deficits including difficulties in
   face-processing and in the social use of gaze. People with ASC are
   thought to have less expertise for gaze processing compared to typical
   controls, though little research has tested this. We investigated gaze
   direction perception in typical males and females, and males with ASC
   using facial stimuli with positive or negative polarity of the eyes.
   Results showed that the ASC group was worse at judging gaze direction
   with positive stimuli, and showed less of a decrement in performance
   when eye stimuli changed from positive to negative polarity. The
   differences in gaze perception for the ASC group were most evident when
   information from the eyes was more difficult and ambiguous. Typical
   females performed better at gaze direction detection with positive
   polarity than typical males, who in turn performed better than males
   with ASC. This latter finding is consistent with the extreme male brain
   theory of autism, and with the idea that people with ASC have less gaze
   expertise.}},

   inferences}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},

Pages = {{165-184}},
Abstract = {{This study measured event-related potentials during spontaneous and
   intentional goal inferences. Participants read sentences describing the
   behavior of a target person from which a strong goal or intention could
   be inferred. The last word of each sentence determined the consistency
   with the goal induced during preceding sentences. In comparison with
   behaviors that were consistent with the implied goal, a stronger P200
   waveform was obtained when the behaviors were irrelevant with that goal
   or did not contain goal-directed behavior at all, and this P200 showed
   considerable parallels between spontaneous and intentional inferences.
   This indicates that goals were inferred rapidly and automatically while
   reading the behaviors, irrespective of the participants' spontaneous or
   intentional instructions. In line with this, source localization
   (LORETA) of the event-related potentials shows predominantly activation
   in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) during and immediately after goal
   detection (225-300 ms). Before and after this time interval, however,
   activation is stronger at the TPJ during spontaneous processing, and
   stronger at the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during intentional
   processing. Memory measures taken after the presentation of the stimulus
   materials support the occurrence of goal inferences and show significant
   correlations with the neural components, indicating that these
   components are valid neural indices of spontaneous and intentional goal
   inferences. The results are highly similar to previous ERP research on
   trait inferences that revealed a similar division of brain activation
   for spontaneous (TPJ) and intentional (mPFC) processes, but appearing
   later at about 600 ms, pointing to similar brain areas recruited for
   social inferences, but at different timings for different inference
   types.}},

   effective connectivity from right LOFC to amygdala differentiated
   emotion expressions conducive to perceiver approach (happy, neutral, and

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{4}},

Pages = {{197-211}},
Abstract = {{Recent neuroimaging work has observed activity in cortical midline
   structures (CMS) such as medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate
   cortices during self-referential processing. Moreover, items rated as
   self-relevant produce increased activity in these regions relative to
   items that are deemed not self-relevant. A common thread among previous
   reports has been reliance on experimental tasks that encourage or
   require online self-referential processing. In this paper, we report
   findings from two experiments that manipulated requirements for
   self-reflection. In Experiment 1, subjects rated trait adjectives for
   social desirability and for self-relevance. Results revealed increasing
   activity in CMS with increasing self-relevance, but only during explicit
   ratings of self-relevance. In Experiment 2, we examined CMS activity
   during passive viewing of personal semantic facts (such as subjects' own
   first names). Taken together, these results suggest that highly
   self-relevant information captures attention through neural mechanisms
   that are comparable to those engaged during explicit self-reflection,
   namely via recruitment of CMS structures.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{212-232}},
Abstract = {{The understanding of actions of tool use depends on the motor act that
   is performed and on the function of the objects involved in the action.
   We used event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the processes
   that derive both kinds of information in a task in which inserting
   actions had to be judged. The actions were presented as two consecutive
   frames, one showing an effector/instrument and the other showing a
   potential target object of the action. Two mismatches were possible. An
   orientation mismatch occurred when the spatial object properties were
   not consistent with a motor act of insertion being performed (i.e.,
   different orientations of insert and slot). A functional mismatch
   happened when the instrument (e.g., screwdriver) would usually not be
   applied to the target object (e.g., keyhole). The order in which
   instrument and target object were presented was also varied. The two
   kinds of mismatch gave rise to similar but not identical negativities in
   the latency range of the N400 followed by a positive modulation. The
   results indicate that the motor act and the function of the objects are
   derived by two at least partially different subprocesses and become
   integrated into a common representation of the observed action.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{233-243}},
Abstract = {{Covert exchange of autonomic responses may shape social affective
   behavior, as observed in mirroring of pupillary responses during sadness
   processing. We examined how, independent of facial emotional expression,
   dynamic coherence between one's own and another's pupil size modulates
   regional brain activity. Fourteen subjects viewed pairs of eye stimuli
   while undergoing fMRI. Using continuous pupillometry biofeedback, the
   size of the observed pupils was varied, correlating positively or
   negatively with changes in participants' own pupils. Viewing both static
   and dynamic stimuli activated right fusiform gyrus. Observing
   dynamically changing pupils activated STS and amygdala, regions engaged
   by non-static and salient facial features. Discordance between observed
   and observer's pupillary changes enhanced activity within bilateral
   anterior insula, left amygdala and anterior cingulate. In contrast,
   processing positively correlated pupils enhanced activity within left
   frontal operculum. Our findings suggest pupillary signals are monitored
   continuously during social interactions and that incongruent changes
   activate brain regions involved in tracking motivational salience and
   attentionally meaningful information. Naturalistically, dynamic
   coherence in pupillary change follows fluctuations in ambient light.
   Correspondingly, in social contexts discordant pupil response is likely
   to reflect divergence of dispositional state. Our data provide empirical
   evidence for an autonomically mediated extension of forward models of
   motor control into social interaction.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},

Pages = {{244-260}},
Abstract = {{Our identity consists of knowledge about our individual attributes
   (personal identity) as well as knowledge about our shared attributes
   derived from our membership in certain social groups (social identity).
   As individuals seek to achieve a positive self-image, they aim at
   comparing favorably with other individuals or their in-group comparing
   favorably with referent out-groups. Imaging data suggest a network
   centered on the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) to instantiate functions
   that are integral to the self, conceived as the personal self. Given
   that the social self is constituted by the same mechanisms as the
   personal self, we expect MPFC activation also for situations in which
   the social self is addressed, for instance when situations permit
   evaluative intergroup comparisons. Accordingly, participants worked on a
   modified version of the minimal group paradigm in the present functional
   magnetic resonance imaging experiment. Imaging data revealed activation
   within a network centered on the dorsal MPFC specifically for social
   identity processes. Furthermore, this activation showed correlation with
   the displayed in-group bias. The present findings show that social and
   personal identity processes draw on the same cerebral correlates and
   hence it is concluded that a network centered on the MPFC subserves
   functions integral to the self.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{261-275}},
Abstract = {{To recognize whether another person's action results in a good or bad
   outcome is imperative for social learning, as well as for understanding
   the behavior of others in a broad context. Recent studies have reported
   that a scalp-surface event-related potential (ERP) called medial-frontal
   negativity (MFN), considered to be an index of negative reward
   processing, is generated when perceiving not only one's own losses, but
   also those of others. This suggests that the same neural mechanisms
   operate in monitoring one's own actions and in perceiving the
   consequences of the actions of others. To further elucidate the
   properties of this observational MFN, this study examined whether its
   amplitude differs with different observational targets. In a gambling
   task, participants observed the performances of non-self agents: a human
   friend and PC programs. The outcomes of the decisions of these agents
   were not associated with the participants' own benefits. ERP results
   showed that the MFN-like pattern was significantly elicited only when
   observing the outcomes of decisions made by human agents. Furthermore,
   self-reported measures of empathy were positively associated with the
   magnitude of the observational MFN. These findings suggest that the
   neural activity in non-self reward processing reflects a socioemotional
   state generated by the target of observation, as well as an empathetic
   trait of the individual.}},

Abstract = {{Shoaling can be considered a simple form of affective behavior displayed
   by social fish in which a single fish exhibits an tendency to approach
   others. In the present study, we adopted a dual approach to investigate
   shoaling behavior in the medaka fish (Oryzias latipes): a behavioral
   pharmacological approach to assess mirror approaching behavior and an
   immunohistochemical approach to examine the neurotransmitter
   distribution in the medaka telencephalon. In order to gain an insight
   into shoaling activity, we examined the pharmacological effects of the
   positive allosteric modulator of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
   anti-anxiety drug, diazepam, and chlorpromazine, a predominantly
   dopaminergic antagonist on mirror approaching behavior and, in
   particular, mirror approaching time (MAT; a tendency to shoal) and
   swimming distance (SWD). Diazepam dose-dependently suppressed MAT, but
   had no effect on SWD. Conversely, chlorpromazine suppressed SWD without
   having effects on MAT. The present study demonstrates for the first time
   that an anti-anxiety drug selectively modifies shoaling behavior in
   fish. Although the mechanism of this modification remains to be fully
   identified, immunohistochemical analysis suggests that a positive
   allosteric modulator of GABA acts on two distinct telencephalic regions.
   Mirror approaching behavior therefore revealed a close relationship with
   the action of the GABA-nergic system and not the dopaminergic system in
   the medaka telencephalon.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies indicated that oxytocin plays an important role in

   In this study, we measured plasma oxytocin levels in patients with

   trust-related interpersonal interactions. Trust-related interactions
   were associated with increased oxytocin levels in controls. This effect
   was absent in patients with schizophrenia. Low oxytocin levels measured
   after trust-related interactions significantly predicted the negative
   symptoms of schizophrenia but were not related to positive symptoms,
   depression, anxiety, and neuropsychological functions. These results
   suggest that decreased trust-related oxytocin release is related to the

Abstract = {{Cultural differences in emotion recognition performance have frequently
   been reported, whereby duration of stay in a foreign culture seems to be
   a crucial factor. Furthermore, cultural aspects influence the neural
   correlates of face and emotion processing thereby also affecting the
   response of the amygdala. Here, the exposure to a foreign culture and
   its influence on the cerebral correlates of facial emotion recognition
   were examined in 24 Asian and 24 age-matched European males. Subjects
   performed an explicit emotion recognition task and were imaged with a 3
   T MR-scanner. Results demonstrate a significant cultural influence on
   the specific recognition of disgust and anger, with higher accuracy
   among the Europeans, while the functional data indicate generally
   elevated amygdala activation in Asians compared to Europeans. Moreover,
   a significant inverse correlation between duration of stay and amygdala
   response emerged, with stronger activation in those subjects with
   shorter duration of stay in Europe. The observed amygdala
   hyperactivation in Asians may reflect novelty aspects but might also be
   associated with greater effort and motivation in immigrants, thus it
   possibly reflects one neural correlate of the oalien-effecto. We
   conclude that exposure to a foreign culture and duration of stay affect
   the behavioral and neural response to facial expressions of emotions.}},

Abstract = {{Although shyness is associated with deficits in different aspects of
   face processing including face recognition and facial emotions, we know
   relatively little about the neural correlates of face processing among
   individuals who are shy. Here we show reduced activation to stranger
   faces among shy adults in a key brain area involved in face processing.
   Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired
   on 12 shy and 12 social young adults during the rapid presentation of
   stranger and personally familiar neutral faces. Shy adults exhibited
   significantly less bilateral activation in the fusiform face area (FFA)
   in response to stranger faces and significantly greater bilateral
   activation in the same region to personally familiar faces than their
   social counterparts. Shy adults also exhibited significantly greater
   right amygdala activation in response to stranger faces than social
   adults. Among social adults, stranger faces elicited greater FFA
   activation than personally familiar faces. Findings suggest that there
   are distinct patterns of neural activation in the FFA in response to
   viewing stranger and personally familiar faces among shy and social
   adults.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{4}},

Pages = {{317-331}},
Abstract = {{Multiple sources of information from the face guide attention during
   social interaction. The present study modified the Posner cueing
   paradigm to investigate how dynamic changes in emotional expression and
   eye gaze in faces affect the neural processing of subsequent target
   stimuli. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while
   participants viewed centrally presented face displays in which gaze
   direction (left, direct, right) and facial expression (fearful, neutral)
   covaried in a fully crossed design. Gaze direction was not predictive of
   peripheral target location. ERP analysis revealed several sequential
   effects, including: (1) an early enhancement of target processing
   following fearful faces (P1); (2) an interaction between expression and
   gaze (N1), with enhanced target processing following fearful faces with
   rightward gaze; and (3) an interaction between gaze and target location
   (P3), with enhanced processing for invalidly cued left visual field
   targets. Behaviorally, participants responded faster to targets
   following fearful faces and targets presented in the right visual field,
   in concordance with the P1 and N1 effects, respectively. The findings
   indicate that two nonverbal social cuesfacial expression and gaze
   directionmodulate attentional orienting across different temporal stages
   of processing. Results have implications for understanding the mental
   chronometry of shared attention and social referencing.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{332-346}},
Abstract = {{Mounting neurophysiological evidence indicates that the visual analysis
   of human movement differs from the visual analysis of other categories
   of complex movement. If different patterns of neural activity underlie
   visual percepts of human and nonhuman movement, then psychophysical
   measures should elucidate different patterns of visual sensitivity to
   human movement and similarly complex, but nonhuman movement. To test
   this prediction, two psychophysical studies compared visual sensitivity
   to human and animal motions. Using a simultaneous masking paradigm,
   observers performed a coherent motion detection task with point-light
   displays of human and horse gait, presented upright and inverted. While
   task performance indicated the use of configural processing during the
   detection of both human and horse motion, observers demonstrated greater
   visual sensitivity to coherent human motion than coherent horse motion.
   Recent experience influenced orientation dependence for both types of
   motion. Together with previous neurophysiological findings, these
   psychophysical results suggest that the visual perception of human
   movement is both distinct from and shares commonalities with the visual
   perception of similarly complex, nonhuman movement.}},

Title = {{The effects of insula damage on decision-making for risky gains and
   losses}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{347-358}},
Abstract = {{Several lines of functional neuroimaging studies have attributed a role
   for the insula, a critical component of the brain's emotional circuitry,
   in risky decision-making. However, very little evidence yet exists as to
   whether the insula is necessary for advantageous decision-making under
   risk, specifically decisions involving uncertain gains and losses. The
   present study uses a risky decision-making task with lesion patients and
   healthy controls to investigate the effects of focal insula damage on
   risk-taking to achieve gains and to avoid losses. Compared to healthy
   controls, insula lesion patients showed an altered decision-making
   pattern in domains involving both risky gains and risky losses.
   Specifically, insula damage was associated with insensitivity to
   differences in expected value between choice options. Additionally,
   patients made significantly fewer risky choices than healthy adults in
   the gain domain. In conjunction with earlier findings, these results
   suggest that risky decision-making is dependent on the integrity of a
   neural circuitry that includes several brain regions known to be
   critical for the experience and expression of emotions, namely the
   insula, amygdala, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. However, each
   neural region seems to provide a distinct contribution to the overall
   process of decision-making.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine or oecstasyo) is a
   recreationally used drug with remarkable and characteristic prosocial
   effects. In spite of abundant attention in the scientific literature,
   the mechanism of its prosocial effects has not been elucidated in
   humans. Recently, research in animals has suggested that the
   neuropeptide oxytocin may induce these effects. In a double blind,
   randomized, crossover, and placebo-controlled study in 15 healthy
   volunteers we assessed blood oxytocin and MDMA concentrations and
   subjective prosocial effects after oral administration of 100 mg MDMA or
   placebo. MDMA induced a robust increase of blood oxytocin concentrations
   and an increase of subjective prosocial feelings. Within subjects, the
   variations in these feelings were significantly and positively
   correlated with variation in oxytocin levels, and the correlations
   between these feelings and oxytocin were significantly stronger than
   those between these feelings and blood MDMA levels. MDMA induces
   oxytocin release in humans, which may be involved in the characteristic
   prosocial effects of ecstasy.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{367-383}},
Abstract = {{Politics is a manifestation of the uniquely human ability to debate,
   decide, and reach consensus on decisions affecting large groups over
   long durations of time. Recent neuroimaging studies on politics have
   focused on the association between brain regions and specific political
   behaviors by adopting party or ideological affiliation as a criterion to
   classify either experimental stimuli or subjects. However, it is
   unlikely that complex political beliefs (i.e., othe government should
   protect freedom of speecho) are evaluated only on a
   liberal-to-conservative criterion. Here we used multidimensional scaling
   and parametric functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify which
   criteria/dimensions people use to structure complex political beliefs
   and which brain regions are concurrently activated. We found that three
   independent dimensions explained the variability of a set of statements
   expressing political beliefs and that each dimension was reflected in a
   distinctive pattern of neural activation: individualism (medial
   prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal junction), conservatism
   (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), and radicalism (ventral striatum and
   posterior cingulate). The structures we identified are also known to be
   important in self-other processing, social decision-making in ambivalent
   situations, and reward prediction. Our results extend current knowledge
   on the neural correlates of the structure of political beliefs, a
   fundamental aspect of the human ability to coalesce into social
   entities.}},

   faces modulates their subsequent neural traces in the brain}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{384-401}},
Abstract = {{Every day we encounter new people, interact with them, and form person
   impressions based on quick and automatic inferences from minimal
   contextual information. Previous studies have identified an extensive
   network of brain areas involved in familiar face recognition, but there
   is little evidence to date concerning the neural bases of negative vs.
   positive person impressions. In the present study, participants were
   repeatedly exposed to 16 unfamiliar face identities within a
   pseudo-interactive game context to generate a perception of either
   ofriendso or ofoeso. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was
   then performed during an old/new memory task to assess any difference in
   brain responses to these now familiar face identities, relative to
   unfamiliar faces. Importantly, whereas facial expressions were always
   emotional (either smiling or angry) during the encoding phase, they were
   always neutral during the memory task. Our results reveal that several
   brain regions involved in familiar face recognition, including fusiform
   cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus, and amygdala, plus additional areas
   involved in motivational control such as caudate and anterior cingulate
   cortex, were differentially modulated as a function of a previous
   encounter, and generally more activated when faces were perceived as
   ofoeso rather than ofriendso. These findings underscore that a key
   dimension of social judgments, based on past impressions of who may be
   supportive or hostile, may lead to long-lasting effects on memory for
   faces and thus influence affective reactions to people during a
   subsequent encounter even in a different (neutral) context.}},

Pages = {{402-411}},
Abstract = {{Self-construals are different between Western and East Asian cultures in
   that the Western self emphasizes self-focused attention more, whereas
   the East Asian self stresses the fundamental social connections between
   people more. To investigate whether such cultural difference in
   self-related processing extends to face recognition, we recorded
   event-related potentials from British and Chinese subjects while they
   judged head orientations of their own face or a familiar face in visual
   displays. For the British, the own-face induced faster responses and a
   larger negative activity at 280-340 ms over the frontal-central area
   (N2) relative to the familiar face. In contrast, the Chinese showed
   weakened self-advantage in behavioral responses and reduced anterior N2
   amplitude to the own-face compared with the familiar face. Our findings
   suggest that enhanced social salience of one's own face results in
   different neurocognitive processes of self-recognition in Western and
   Chinese cultures.}},

Title = {{Neural correlates of reflection on goal states: The role of regulatory
   focus and temporal distance}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{412-425}},
Abstract = {{Effective self-regulation requires the ability to consider alternate
   goal states in order to adapt to shifting circumstances. Previous
   research on goal reflection has identified goal-type dissociations in
   brain regions broadly associated with self-projection. Importantly,
   however, there is a need to distinguish activation differences due to
   recruitment of distinct processes from activations that reflect common
   processes with varying levels of recruitment. The fact that different
   types of goals tend to covary naturally with time allowed us to vary the
   difficulty of goal reflection across content domains. Participants in an
   fMRI study thought about promotion or prevention goals at three time
   points. Goals that varied in terms of content, time-frame, valence, and
   abstractness but were difficult to construct (relative to other goals)
   activated an area of dorsal medial PFC, suggesting that this region may
   support general-purpose projective processes. In contrast, goals that
   were easy to construct activated a region of dorsolateral PFC involved
   in domain-general memory retrieval. Importantly, we also observed
   domain-specific effects of goal type and temporal distance; promotion
   goals were associated with heightened activity in medial PFC, short-term
   goals activated precuneus and anterior cingulate cortex, and longer-term
   goals activated frontal areas, including ventrolateral PFC and
   orbitofrontal cortex.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},

Pages = {{426-442}},
Abstract = {{The neural correlates of the perception of faces from different races
   were investigated. White participants performed a gender identification
   task in which Asian, Black, and White faces were presented while
   event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. Participants also
   completed an implicit association task for Black (IAT-Black) and Asian
   (IAT-Asian) faces. ERPs evoked by Black and White faces differed, with
   Black faces evoking a larger positive ERP that peaked at 168 ms over the
   frontal scalp, and White faces evoking a larger negative ERP that peaked
   at 244 ms. These Black/White ERP differences significantly correlated
   with participants' scores on the IAT-Black. ERPs also differentiated
   White from Asian faces and a significant correlation was obtained
   between the White-Asian ERP difference waves at similar to 500 ms and
   the IAT-Asian. A positive ERP at 116 ms over occipital scalp
   differentiated all three races, but was not correlated with either IAT.
   In addition, a late positive component (around 592 ms) was greater for
   the same race compared to either other race faces, suggesting
   potentially more extended or deeper processing of the same race faces.
   Taken together, the ERP/IAT correlations observed for both other races
   indicate the influence of a race-sensitive evaluative process that may
   include early more automatic and/or implicit processes and relatively
   later more controlled processes.}},

Title = {{Decreased ventral anterior cingulate cortex activity is associated with
   reduced social pain during emotional support}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{443-454}},
Abstract = {{People feel psychological pain when they are excluded, and this pain is
   often attenuated when emotional support is received. It is therefore
   likely that a specific neural mechanism underlies the detection of
   social exclusion. Similarly, specific neural mechanisms may underlie the
   beneficial effects of emotional support. Although neuroimaging
   researchers have recently examined the neural basis of social pain,
   there is presently no agreement as to which part of the anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC) is involved in the perception and modulation of
   social pain. We hypothesized that activity in those brain regions that
   are associated with social pain would be correlated with decrements in
   social pain induced by emotional support. To examine the effects of
   emotional support on social pain caused by exclusion, we conducted an
   fMRI study in which participants played a virtual ball-tossing game.
   Participants were initially included and later excluded from the game.
   In the latter half of the session from which participants were excluded,
   participants received emotionally supportive text messages. We found
   that emotional support led to increased activity in the left
   lateral/medial prefrontal cortices and some temporal regions. Those
   individuals who experienced greater attenuation of social pain exhibited
   lower ventral ACC and higher left lateral prefrontal cortex activation.
   These results suggest that the ventral ACC underlies social pain, and
   that emotional support enhances prefrontal cortex activity, which in
   turn may lead to a weakened affective response.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Pages = {{455-463}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, several neuroimaging studies have suggested that the
   neural basis of the self-referential process1 is special, especially in
   the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). However, it remains controversial
   whether activity of the MPFC (and other related brain regions) appears
   only during the self-referential process. We investigated the neural
   correlates during the processing of references to the self, close other
   (friend), and distant other (prime minister) using fMRI. In comparison
   with baseline findings, referential processing to the three kinds of
   persons defined above showed common activation patterns in the
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), left middle temporal gyrus, left
   angular gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex and right cerebellum.
   Additionally, percent changes in BOLD signal in five regions of interest
   demonstrated the same findings. The result indicated that DMPFC was not
   special for the self-referential process, while there are common neural
   bases for evaluating the personalities of the self and others.}},

Abstract = {{The utility of using indices of neural function to identify deception
   relies on finding highly reliable and valid approaches that adequately
   identify the guilty and exonerate the innocent. A class of approaches,
   based on the guilty knowledge technique (GKT), assume that guilty
   individuals will recognize specific crime-relevant details, whereas
   innocent individuals will not. Memory distortions, however, may limit
   the accuracy of such procedures. To investigate these limits, two
   studies were conducted to examine whether brain electrical activity
   could differentiate true from false recollections elicited by the
   Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm. The design of each study
   maximized the opportunity of finding electrocortical differences between
   true and false recognition. Each study found very high rates of false
   recognition, with little evidence that brain electrical activity could
   differentiate true from false memories. Results suggested that under
   certain conditions both true and false recollections can produce a
   pattern of brain activity indicative of recognition.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Previous tests of P300 in deception detection have focused mainly on
   amplitude analysis. Since countermeasures for such tests have been
   reported, we looked here at other possible variables as deception
   indices: P300 scalp distribution and amplitude variance, both across 30
   sites. We were also concerned, for the first time, in testing for
   recognition of more than one guilty item in a mock crime scenario. There
   were three groups: (1) two-probe group, two of six items were guilty
   knowledge (GK) items; (2) three-probe group, three of six items were GK
   items; (3) control group, zero of six items were GK items. In group
   analyses, in the two-probe group, P300s for lies were significantly
   greater than P300s for truthful responses. There were significant
   interactions of condition (Lie vs Truth) by site, suggesting different
   scalp profiles for deceptive versus truthful responding. Amplitude
   variance across sites was also greater in Lie than in Truth blocks.
   These results did not obtain in the three-probe and control groups. In
   terms of amplitude variances in probe conditions across groups,
   two-probe group was larger than three-probe and control groups.
   Regarding individual diagnostics, the variance method yielded a
   greater-than-chance detection rate of 71\% versus 28\% false positives.
   Regarding amplitude at multiple nonfrontal sites, 71\% of guilty
   subjects were detected versus 14\% false positives. Grier's (1971) A'
   indices of various test discrimination efficiencies varied from .76 to
   .87. Results of the present study suggested further investigation of the
   variance method as a diagnostic tool for lie detection.}},

Abstract = {{Observation of changes in autonomic arousal was one of the first
   methodologies used to detect deception. Electrodermal activity (EDA) is
   a peripheral measure of autonomic arousal and one of the primary
   channels used in polygraph exams. In an attempt to develop a more
   central measure to identify lies, the use of functional magnetic
   resonance inaging (fMRI) to detect deception is being investigated. We
   wondered if adding EDA to our fMRI analysis would improve our diagnostic
   ability. For our approach, however, adding EDA did not improve the
   accuracy in a laboratory-based deception task. In testing for brain
   regions that replicated as correlates of EDA, we did find significant
   associations in right orbitofrontal and bilateral anterior cingulate
   regions. Further work is required to test whether EDA improves accuracy
   in other testing formats or with higher levels of jeopardy.}},

Title = {{Towards clinical trials of lie detection with fMRI}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{518-527}},
Abstract = {{Recent reports of successful fMRI-based discrimination between lie and
   truth in single subjects raised the interest of prospective users and a
   public concern about the potential scope of this technology. The
   increased scrutiny highlighted the lack of controlled oreal lifeo, i.e.
   prospective clinical trials of this technology that conform to the
   common standards of medical device development. The ethics of conducting
   such trials given the paucity of data on fMRI-based lie detection has
   also been questioned. To probe the potential issues of translating the
   laboratory research into practice, we conducted a case study in which we
   adapted the standard Guilty Knowledge Test (GKT), a well-established
   model of producing deception, to the common scenario of lying on a
   resume. The task consisted of questions about pertinent items on the
   subject's resume, three of which could be independently verified as
   truth (KNOWN) and three that could not be verified and were thus termed
   UNKNOWN. The subject had an incentive to lie on all UNKNOWN items, and
   on debriefing confirmed that he had done so. Data was preprocessed,
   masked with a priori regions of interest, thresholded, and qualitatively
   evaluated for consistency with the previously reported
   prefronto-parietal Lie Truth pattern. Deceptive responses to two out of
   the three UNKNOWN items were associated with the predicted
   prefronto-parietal fMRI pattern. In the third UNKNOWN this pattern was
   absent, and instead, increased limbic (amygdala and hippocampus)
   response was observed. Based on published prefronto-parietal Lie
   response pattern, only the first two items could be categorized as Lie.
   If confirmed, this demonstration of amygdala and hippocampus activation
   in a Lie Truth contrast illustrates the need to integrate the limbic
   system and its emotional and cognitive correlates into the existing
   model of deception. Our experiment suggests an approach to a
   naturalistic scenario and the research questions that need to be
   answered in order to set the stage for prospective clinical trials of
   fMRI-based lie detection.}},

Abstract = {{Functional brain imaging has been considered a new and better technique
   for the detection of deception. The reasoning is that there is a neural
   locus or circuit for lying that is sensitive, specific, generalizable
   across individuals and measurement contexts, and robust to
   countermeasures. To determine the extent to which the group results
   predicted lying at the level of the individual, we reanalyzed data on 14
   participants from a study that had previously identified regions
   involved in lying (thus satisfying the criterion for sensitivity). We
   assessed the efficacy of functionally determined brain regions based on
   the lie-truth contrast for N - 1 participants to detect deception in the
   Nth individual. Results showed that no region could be used to correctly
   detect deception across all individuals. The best results were obtained
   for medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), correctly identifying 71\% of
   participants as lying with no false alarms. Lowering the threshold for a
   response increased hits and false alarms. The results suggest that
   although brain imaging is a more direct index of cognition than the
   traditional polygraph, it is subject to many of the same caveats and
   thus neuroimaging does not appear to reveal processes that are
   necessarily unique to deception.}},

Abstract = {{Two hypotheses were tested using a novel individual differences
   approach, which identifies rate-limiting brain regions, that is, brain
   regions in which variations in neural activity predict variations in
   behavioral performance. The first hypothesis is that the rate-limiting

   are partially distinct from those underlying the production of lies
   about other individuals (other-related). The second hypothesis is that a
   cingulate-insular-prefrontal network found to be rate-limiting for
   interference tasks is involved in both types of lies. The results
   confirmed both hypotheses and supported the utility of this individual
   differences approach in the study of deception in particular, as well in

Pages = {{554-569}},
Abstract = {{The two studies reported in this article are an extension of the
   neuroimaging study by Ganis et al. (2003), which provided evidence that
   different types of lies arise from different cognitive processes. We
   examined the initial response times (IRTs) to questions answered both
   deceptively and truthfully. We considered four types of deceptive
   responses: a coherent set of rehearsed, memorized lies about a life
   experience; a coherent set of lies spontaneously created about a life
   experience; a set of isolated lies involving self-knowledge; and a set
   of isolated lies involving knowledge of another person. We assessed the
   difference between truthful and deceptive IRTs. Scores from cognitive
   tasks included in the MiniCog Rapid Assessment Battery (MRAB) were
   significant predictors of IRT differences. Each type of lie was
   predicted by a distinct set of MRAB scores. These results provide
   further evidence that deception is a multifaceted process and that
   different kinds of lies arise from the operation of different cognitive
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{Although a number of recent neuroimaging studies have examined the
   relationship between the brain and deception, the neurological
   correlates of deception are still not well understood. The present study
   sought to assess differences in cortical excitability during the act of
   deception by measuring motor evoked potentials (MEPs) during
   transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Sports fanatics and
   low-affiliation sports fans were presented with preferred and rival team
   images and were asked to deceptively or honestly identify their favored
   team. Hemispheric differences were found including greater excitability
   of the left motor cortex during the generation of deceptive responses.
   In contrast to current physiological measures of deception, level of
   arousal was not found to differentiate truthful and deceptive responses.
   The results are presented in terms of a complex cognitive pattern
   contributing to the generation of deceptive responses.}},
