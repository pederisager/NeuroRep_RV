Abstract = {{Social interaction deficits and restricted repetitive behaviors and
   interests that characterize autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) may both
   reflect aberrant functioning of brain reward circuits. However, no
   neuroimaging study to date has investigated the integrity of reward
   circuits using an incentive delay paradigm in individuals with ASDs. In
   the present study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to
   assess blood-oxygen level-dependent activation during reward
   anticipation and outcomes in 15 participants with an ASD and 16 matched
   control participants. Brain activation was assessed during anticipation
   of and in response to monetary incentives and object image incentives
   previously shown to be visually salient for individuals with ASDs (e.g.
   trains, electronics). Participants with ASDs showed decreased nucleus
   accumbens activation during monetary anticipation and outcomes, but not
   during object anticipation or outcomes. Group x reward-type-interaction
   tests revealed robust interaction effects in bilateral nucleus accumbens
   during reward anticipation and in ventromedial prefrontal cortex during
   reward outcomes, indicating differential responses contingent on reward
   type in these regions. Results suggest that ASDs are characterized by
   reward-circuitry hypoactivation in response to monetary incentives but
   not in response to autism-relevant object images. The clinical
   implications of the double dissociation of reward type and temporal
   phase in reward circuitry function in ASD are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{When an adult claims he cannot sleep without his teddy bear, people tend
   to react surprised. Language interpretation is, thus, influenced by
   social context, such as who the speaker is. The present study reveals
   inter-individual differences in brain reactivity to social aspects of
   language. Whereas women showed brain reactivity when stereotype-based
   inferences about a speaker conflicted with the content of the message,
   men did not. This sex difference in social information processing can be
   explained by a specific cognitive trait, one's ability to empathize.
   Individuals who empathize to a greater degree revealed larger N400
   effects (as well as a larger increase in gamma-band power) to socially
   relevant information. These results indicate that individuals with
   high-empathizing skills are able to rapidly integrate information about
   the speaker with the content of the message, as they make use of
   voice-based inferences about the speaker to process language in a
   top-down manner. Alternatively, individuals with lower empathizing
   skills did not use information about social stereotypes in implicit
   sentence comprehension, but rather took a more bottom-up approach to the
   processing of these social pragmatic sentences.}},

Abstract = {{Social bonds fulfill the basic human need to belong. Being rejected
   thwarts this basic need, putting bonds with others at risk. Attachment
   theory suggests that people satisfy their need to belong through
   different means. Whereas anxious attachment is associated with craving
   acceptance and showing vigilance to cues that signal possible rejection,
   avoidant attachment is associated with discomfort with closeness and
   using avoidant strategies to regulate one's relationships. Given these
   different styles by which people satisfy their need to belong (that can
   operate simultaneously within the same individual), responses to social
   rejection may differ according to these individual differences in
   attachment anxiety and avoidance. To test this hypothesis, we used
   neuroimaging techniques to examine how the degree to which people
   display each of the two attachment dimensions (anxiety and avoidance)
   uniquely correlated with their neural activity during a simulated
   experience of social exclusion. Anxious attachment related to heightened
   activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and anterior
   insula, regions previously associated with rejection-related distress.
   In contrast, avoidant attachment related to less activity in these
   regions. Findings are discussed in terms of the strategies that
   individuals with varying attachment styles might use to promote
   maintenance of social bonds.}},

Abstract = {{The idea of `extended self' refers to the incorporation of personally
   relevant external stimuli into one's concept of self. The current study
   used a transient imagined ownership paradigm to explore brain regions
   that support the association between self and objects. We hypothesized
   that incidental associations between self and objects would be
   manifested by activation in a brain region, medial prefrontal cortex
   (MPFC), recruited in explicit self-referential processing. We further
   predicted that a memorial advantage for, and positivity-bias towards,
   self-relevant objects would be related to activity in MPFC. As
   anticipated, MPFC showed greater activation when objects were assigned
   to participants compared to when objects were assigned to another
   person. Activity in MPFC was also associated with superior subsequent
   source memory and increased preference for objects assigned to the self.
   These findings provide neural evidence for the incorporation of
   self-relevant objects into an extended self, which, in turn, increases
   their judged value (mere ownership effect).}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated whether human chemosensory-stress cues affect
   neural activity related to the evaluation of emotional stimuli.
   Chemosensory stimuli were obtained from the sweat of 64 male donors
   during both stress (first-time skydive) and control (exercise)
   conditions, indistinguishable by odor. We then recorded event-related
   potentials (ERPs) from an unrelated group of 14 participants while they
   viewed faces morphed with neutral-to-angry expressions and inhaled
   nebulized stress and exercise sweat in counter-balanced blocks, blind to
   condition. Results for the control condition ERPs were consistent with
   previous findings: the late positive potential (LPP; 400-600 ms post
   stimulus) in response to faces was larger for threatening than both
   neutral and ambiguous faces. In contrast, the stress condition was
   associated with a heightened LPP across all facial expressions; relative
   to control, the LPP was increased for both ambiguous and neutral faces
   in the stress condition. These results suggest that stress sweat may
   impact electrocortical activity associated with attention to salient

Abstract = {{The amygdala is critically involved in mediating physiological and

   indicates that the amygdala is highly responsive to facial signals of

   the magnitude of amygdala reactivity to facial signals of threat. Here,
   we report the novel finding that individual differences in trait anger
   are positively correlated with bilateral dorsal amygdala reactivity to
   angry facial expressions, but only among men with elevated trait anxiety
   scores. These findings add to the growing body of evidence indicating
   that variability in personality traits contribute to individual
   differences in threat-related amygdala reactivity and further suggest
   that heightened amygdala reactivity to angry faces may be uniquely
   involved in the expression of reactive aggression in men.}},

   and best friend, are differentially represented in collectivistic
   brains. Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a trait
   judgment task, we showed evidence that, while trait judgments of the
   self and mother generated comparable activity in the medial prefrontal
   cortex (MPFC) and anterior cingulate (ACC) of Chinese adults, trait
   judgments of mother induced greater MPFC/ACC activity than trait
   judgments of father and best friend. Our results suggest that, while
   neural representations of the self and mother overlapped in the
   MPFC/ACC, close others such as mother, father and best friend are
   unequally represented in the MPFC/ACC of collectivistic brains.}},

Abstract = {{Gender-based stereotypes undermine females' performance on challenging
   math tests, but how do they influence their ability to learn from the
   errors they make? Females under stereotype threat or non-threat were
   presented with accuracy feedback after each problem on a GRE-like math
   test, followed by an optional interactive tutorial that provided
   step-wise problem-solving instruction. Event-related potentials tracked
   the initial detection of the negative feedback following errors
   {[}feedback related negativity (FRN), P3a], as well as any subsequent
   sustained attention/arousal to that information {[}late positive
   potential (LPP)]. Learning was defined as success in applying tutorial
   information to correction of initial test errors on a surprise retest
   24-h later. Under non-threat conditions, emotional responses to negative
   feedback did not curtail exploration of the tutor, and the amount of
   tutor exploration predicted learning success. In the stereotype threat
   condition, however, greater initial salience of the failure (FRN)
   predicted less exploration of the tutor, and sustained attention to the
   negative feedback (LPP) predicted poor learning from what was explored.
   Thus, under stereotype threat, emotional responses to negative feedback
   predicted both disengagement from learning and interference with
   learning attempts. We discuss the importance of emotion regulation in
   successful rebound from failure for stigmatized groups in
   stereotype-salient environments.}},

Abstract = {{When you see someone reach into a cookie jar, their goal remains obvious
   even if you know that the last cookie has already been eaten. Thus, it
   is possible to infer the goal of an action even if you know that the
   goal cannot be achieved. Previous research has identified distinct brain
   networks for processing information about object locations, actions and
   mental-state inferences. However, the relationship between brain
   networks for action understanding in social contexts remains unclear.
   Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, this study assesses the
   role of these networks in understanding another person searching for
   hidden objects. Participants watched movie clips depicting a toy animal
   hiding and an actor, who was ignorant of the hiding place, searching in
   the filled or empty location. When the toy animal hid in the same
   location repeatedly, the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response
   was suppressed in occipital, posterior temporal and posterior parietal
   brain regions, consistent with processing object properties and spatial
   attention. When the actor searched in the same location repeatedly, the
   BOLD signal was suppressed in the inferior frontal gyrus, consistent
   with the observation of hand actions. In contrast, searches towards the
   filled location compared to the empty location were associated with a
   greater response in the medial prefrontal cortex and right temporal
   pole, which are both associated with mental state inference. These
   findings show that when observing another person search for a hidden
   object, brain networks for processing information about object
   properties, actions and mental state inferences work together in a
   complementary fashion. This supports the hypothesis that brain regions
   within and beyond the putative human mirror neuron system are involved
   in action comprehension within social contexts.}},

Abstract = {{From its origins in how the brain controls the endocrine system via the
   hypothalamus and pituitary gland, neuroendocrinology has evolved into a
   science that now includes hormone action on many aspects of brain
   function. These actions involve the whole central nervous system and not
   just the hypothalamus. Advances in our understanding of cellular and
   molecular actions of steroid hormones have gone beyond the important
   cell nuclear actions of steroid hormone receptors to include signaling
   pathways that intersect with other mediators such as neurotransmitters
   and neuromodulators. This has, in turn, broadened the search for and
   identification of steroid receptors to include nonnuclear sites in
   synapses, dendrites, mitochondria, and glial cells, as well as cell
   nuclei. The study of estrogen receptors and estrogen actions on
   processes related to cognition, mood, autonomic regulation, pain, and
   neuroprotection, among other functions, has led the way in this new view
   of hormone actions on the brain. In this review, we summarize past and
   current work in our laboratory on this topic. This exciting and growing
   field involving many laboratories continues to reshape our ideas and
   approaches to neuroendocrinology both at the bench and the bedside.}},

Abstract = {{Gonadal hormones modulate behavioral responses to sexual stimuli, and
   communication signals can also modulate circulating hormone levels. In
   several species, these combined effects appear to underlie a two-way
   interaction between circulating gonadal hormones and behavioral
   responses to socially salient stimuli. Recent work in songbirds has
   shown that manipulating local estradiol levels in the auditory forebrain
   produces physiological changes that affect discrimination of conspecific
   vocalizations and can affect behavior. These studies provide new
   evidence that estrogens can directly alter auditory processing and
   indirectly alter the behavioral response to a stimulus. These studies
   show that: I) Local estradiol action within an auditory area is
   necessary for socially relevant sounds to induce normal physiological
   responses in the brains of both sexes; 2) These physiological effects
   occur much more quickly than predicted by the classical time-frame for
   genomic effects; 3) Estradiol action within the auditory forebrain
   enables behavioral discrimination among socially relevant sounds in
   males; and 4) Estradiol is produced locally in the male brain during
   exposure to particular social interactions. The accumulating evidence
   suggests a socio-neuro-endocrinology framework in which estradiol is
   essential to auditory processing, is increased by a socially relevant
   stimulus, acts rapidly to shape perception of subsequent stimuli
   experienced during social interactions, and modulates behavioral
   responses to these stimuli. Brain estrogens are likely to function
   similarly in both songbird sexes because aromatase and estrogen
   receptors are present in both male and female forebrain. Estrogenic
   modulation of perception in songbirds and perhaps other animals could
   fine-tune male advertising signals and female ability to discriminate
   them, facilitating mate selection by modulating behaviors.}},

Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{A wealth of data collected in recent decades has demonstrated that
   ovarian sex-steroid hormones, particularly 17 beta-estradiol (E-2), are
   important trophic factors that regulate the function of cognitive
   regions of the brain such as the hippocampus. The loss of hormone
   cycling at menopause is associated with cognitive decline and dementia
   in women, and the onset of memory decline in animal models. However,
   hormone therapy is not currently recommended to prevent or treat
   cognitive decline, in part because of its detrimental side effects. In
   this article, it is proposed that investigations of the rapid effects of
   E-2 on hippocampal function be used to further the design of new drugs
   that mimic the beneficial effects of E-2 on memory without the side
   effects of current therapies. A conceptual model is presented for
   elucidating the molecular and biochemical mechanisms through which
   sex-steroid hormones modulate memory, and a specific hypothesis is
   proposed to account for the rapid memory-enhancing effects of E-2.
   Empirical support for this hypothesis is discussed as a means of
   stimulating the consideration of new directions for the development of
   hormone-based therapies to preserve memory function in menopausal women.}},

Abstract = {{Pregnancy and motherhood constitute periods of tremendous hormonal
   variation that orchestrate parturition, lactation, maternal care,
   maternal aggression, and recognition of offspring, among other
   functions. Cognitive processing also varies during pregnancy and
   motherhood and may serve an adaptive function in preparation for
   parturition and rearing. Additionally, maternal experience may have
   enduring consequences for the brain, behavior, and cognition long after
   offspring are mature. However, the early postpartum period also renders
   women psychologically vulnerable as approximately 15\% of women
   experience postpartum depression, with estimates of 50-80\% reporting a
   milder form of depression termed ``maternal blues.{''} This review will
   present literature on pregnancy- and parity-related changes in both
   cognition and affect and how these changes likely involve plastic
   changes within the hippocampus, a region that is sensitive to
   reproductive hormones. Further, this review will discuss steroid and
   peptide hormones that may contribute to affective and cognitive
   disruptions during pregnancy and postpartum. Research in this area may
   reveal insight into how pregnancy and motherhood alter the likelihood of
   developing postpartum depression and related disorders.}},

   a battery of neuropsychological tests, tested once during the third
   trimester of pregnancy and once during the early postpartum period, was
   compared with that of 21 nonpregnant controls matched for age and
   education. Women in the pregnancy group had significantly lower scores
   than the controls during both the pre- and postpartum visits on tasks of
   verbal recall and processing speed. CURT levels were significantly
   associated, in an inverted-boolean OR function, with verbal recall
   scores at both the pregnancy and at postpartum periods and with spatial
   abilities at postpartum only. During pregnancy, PRL levels were
   associated in both a linear and an inverted-boolean OR function with

Abstract = {{There is considerable controversy about the origins of sex differences
   in cognitive abilities, particularly the male superiority in spatial
   abilities. We studied effects of early androgens on spatial and
   mechanical abilities in adolescents and young adults with congenital
   adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). On tests of three-dimensional mental
   rotations, geography, and mechanical knowledge, females with CAH scored
   higher than their unaffected sisters, and males with CAR scored lower
   than their unaffected brothers. Exploratory regression analyses suggest
   that androgens affect spatial ability in females directly and through
   male-typed activity interests. Findings indicate that early androgens
   influence spatial and mechanical abilities, and that androgen effects on
   abilities may occur in part through effects on sex-typed activity
   interests.}},

Abstract = {{Social Recognition is a fundamental skill that forms the basis of
   behaviors essential to the proper functioning of pair or group living in
   most social species. We review here various neurobiological and genetic
   studies that point to an interplay of oxytocin (OT),
   arginine-vasopressin (AVP), and the gonadal hormones, estrogens and
   testosterone, in the mediation of social recognition. Results of a
   number of studies have shown that OT and its actions at the medial
   amygdala seem to be essential for social recognition in both sexes.
   Estrogens facilitate social recognition, possibly by regulating OT
   production in the hypothalamus and the OT receptors at the medial
   amygdala. Estrogens also affect social recognition on a rapid time
   scale, likely through nongenomic actions. The mechanisms of these rapid
   effects are currently unknown but available evidence points at the
   hippocampus as the possible site of action. Male rodents seem to be more
   dependent on AVP acting at the level of the lateral septum for social
   recognition than female rodents. Results of various studies suggest that
   testosterone and its metabolites (including estradiol) influence social
   recognition in males primarily through the AVP V1a receptor. Overall, it
   appears that gonadal hormone modulation of OT and AVP regulates and fine
   tunes social recognition and those behaviors that depend upon it (e.g.,
   social bonds, social hierarchies) in a sex specific manner. This points
   at an important role for these neuroendocrine systems in the regulation
   of the sex differences that are evident in social behavior and of
   sociality as a whole.}},

Abstract = {{Because no organism lives in an unchanging environment, sensory
   processes must remain plastic so that in any context, they emphasize the
   most relevant signals. As the behavioral relevance of sociosexual
   signals changes along with reproductive state, the perception of those
   signals is altered by reproductive hormones such as estradiol (E2). We
   showed previously that in white-throated sparrows, immediate early gene
   responses in the auditory pathway of females are selective for
   conspecific male song only when plasma E2 is elevated to
   breeding-typical levels. In this study, we looked for evidence that
   E2-dependent modulation of auditory responses is mediated by
   serotonergic systems. In female nonbreeding white-throated sparrows
   treated with E2, the density of fibers immunoreactive for serotonin
   transporter innervating the auditory midbrain and rostral auditory
   forebrain increased compared with controls. E2 treatment also increased
   the concentration of the serotonin metabolite 5-HIAA in the caudomedial
   mesopallium of the auditory forebrain. In a second experiment, females
   exposed to 30 min of conspecific male song had higher levels of 5-HIAA
   in the caudomedial nidopallium of the auditory forebrain than birds not
   exposed to song. Overall, we show that in this seasonal breeder, (a)
   serotonergic fibers innervate auditory areas; (b) the density of those
   fibers is higher in females with breeding-typical levels of E2 than in
   nonbreeding, untreated females; and (c) serotonin is released in the
   auditory forebrain within minutes in response to conspecific
   vocalizations. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that E2
   acts via serotonin systems to alter auditory processing.}},

Abstract = {{Extant research findings allow several conclusions regarding the
   relationship between estrogen and cognitive functioning across the
   female life span. First, performance on tests of verbal memory
   fluctuates in concert with physiological changes in ovarian hormone
   production during the menstrual cycle and during pregnancy and the
   postpartum period. Estrogen therapy (ET) prevents the decrease in verbal
   memory when administered immediately following the surgical removal of
   both ovaries in premenopausal women. Some, but relatively little
   evidence is available to support the idea that ET, initiated at the time
   of a natural or a surgical menopause for a few years, may protect
   against cognitive decline 30 years later and more research in this area
   is urgently needed. Finally, the evidence to date strongly suggests that
   the initiation of ET decades after the menopause has occurred does not
   protect against cognitive decline or dementia. Taken together, these
   findings support the so-called ``window of opportunity{''} hypothesis
   which holds that ET will be neuroprotective only when administered
   closely in time to a natural or surgical menopause.}},

Abstract = {{Studies have shown that ovarian hormones protect against some of the
   cognitive deficits associated with aging. Although much of the
   literature in rodents has focused on hippocampal dependent tasks,
   studies suggest that tasks dependent on the prefrontal cortex are also
   influenced by ovarian hormones. The present study investigated the
   effects of ovarian hormone treatment during aging on a delayed
   alternation t-maze. Female Long Evans hooded rats were ovariectomized at
   middle age (11-12 months) and placed in 1 of 5 treatment groups: no
   replacement, chronic estradiol (E-2), cyclic E-2, chronic E-2 and
   progesterone, or chronic E-2 and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA).
   Following 6 months of hormone treatment, animals were trained to
   alternate in a t-maze. After reaching criterion, a series of delays from
   5 to 90 s were introduced in random order. Rats receiving E-2 with MPA
   reached criterion significantly faster than animals not receiving
   treatment and those who received chronic or cyclic E-2 only. There was a
   nonsignificant trend for animals receiving E-2 and progesterone to reach
   criterion in fewer sessions than animals receiving E-2 only. Mode of
   administration, cyclic or chronic, did not affect performance. Hormones
   did not affect performance on the delayed alternation. This study, in
   combination with previous research, indicates that hormone effects
   cannot be generalized across tasks, age, or duration, and long-term
   estrogen in combination with MPA can be beneficial for some tasks.}},

Abstract = {{Women experience profound hormonal fluctuations throughout their
   reproductive lives. They are especially susceptible to disturbances in
   mood and cognition during the transition from pregnancy into postpartum
   and motherhood (Brummelte \& Galea, 2010). Their behavioral and hormonal
   responses to stressful stimuli are also altered during this time. These
   changes are not limited to humans but occur in many mammalian species.
   Virgin female rats express a severe learning deficit in associative
   eyeblink conditioning after a stressful life event (Wood, Beylin, \&
   Shors, 2001; Wood \& Shors, 1998), but lactating females or those that
   are caring for young learn well even after the stressor (Leuner \&
   Short, 2006). However, we do not know whether maternal experience
   persistently alters learning after a stressful event. Here we
   hypothesized that females that had been maternal at some time in their
   lives would learn well even after exposure to a stressful event. To test
   this hypothesis, females that had at least one brood of young and
   expressed a normal estrous cycle were exposed to an acute stressful
   event that reliably impairs learning in virgin females. Animals were
   trained 24 hr later with classical eyeblink conditioning. Exposure to
   the stressor suppressed learning in virgins but not in females that had
   been mothers at some time in their lives. These data suggest that
   maternal experience induces a protective mechanism in mothers, which
   promotes associative learning long after the offspring have left their
   care.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the effects of chronic restraint stress and
   repeated cyclic estradiol pulses on hippocampal CA3 and CA1 dendritic
   and/or spine morphology and spatial memory in female rats.
   Sprague-Dawley adult female rats were ovariectomized and then injected
   over 2 days with 17 beta-estradiol (10 mu g, s.c.), which was repeated
   every 4-5 days. While all rats received similar estradiol injection
   histories, half of the rats were chronically restrained and/or given a
   final cyclic pulse of estradiol prior to testing on a
   hippocampal-dependent object placement (OP) task to assess spatial
   memory. OP testing was performed 2 days after the last restraint
   session, as well as when the last 2 estradiol pulses best captured the
   maximal effect on hippocampal CA1 spine density. The data revealed
   several novel findings: (a) chronic stress or estradiol separately
   facilitated spatial memory, but did not have the same effects when
   coadministered, (b) CA1 spine densities negatively correlated with
   spatial memory, and (c) repeated estradiol pulses failed to prevent
   stress-induced CA3 dendritic retraction. We also corroborated previous
   studies showing increased CA1 spine density following estradiol, chronic
   stress, and behavioral manipulations. The present study uniquely
   combined chronic stress, repeated estradiol pulses, hippocampal
   morphology, and behavior within the same animals, allowing for
   correlational analyses to be performed between CA1 spine morphology and
   spatial memory. We demonstrate novel findings that chronic stress or
   estradiol pulses independently facilitate spatial memory, but not when
   coadministered, and that these effects may involve a balance of CA1
   apical spine expression that is independent of CA3 dendritic complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Both animal and human studies suggest that cognitive bias toward
   negative information, such as that observed in major depression, may
   arise through the interaction of cortisol (CORT) and norepinephrine (NE)
   within the amygdala. To date, there is no published account of the
   relationship between endogenous NE and CORT levels and cognitive bias.
   The present study examined salivary CORT and salivary alpha-amylase
   (sAA), an indirect measure of NE, in relation to masked affective
   priming of words in young female participants. Women with higher
   salivary CORT showed increased priming to negative word pairs only when
   sAA was also high; when sAA was low, no effect of CORT on priming was
   observed. These results are in line with previous research indicating
   that increased CORT is linked to enhanced processing of negative
   information. However, our findings extend this literature in providing
   evidence that CORT predicts enhanced processing of negatively valenced
   information only in the presence of higher sAA.}},

   designed to examine decisions to accurately shoot or not shoot armed and

   who had larger cortisol increases to the social-stress task subsequently
   made fewer errors when deciding to shoot armed Black targets relative to
   armed White targets, suggesting that hypothalamic pituitary adrenal

Abstract = {{Exposure to Bisphenol-A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor used in plastics,
   occurs in the United States on a daily basis. Recent studies suggest
   exposure during development causes memory deficits later in life;
   however, the ramifications of exposure in adulthood are unclear. We
   examined the effects of acute BPA administration (40 mu g/kg) on memory
   and synaptic plasticity in adult male rats. BPA significantly impaired
   both visual and spatial memory and decreased dendritic spine density on
   pyramidal cells in CA1 and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC).
   Additionally, BPA significantly decreased PSD-95, a synaptic marker, in
   the hippocampus and increased cytosolic pCREB, a transcription factor,
   in mPFC. Together, these findings show that a single dose of BPA, below
   the USEPA reference safe daily limit of 50 mu g/kg/day, may block the
   formation of new memories by interfering with neural plasticity
   processes in the adult brain.}},

Volume = {{126}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Systemic injections of an NMDA antagonist have been shown to impair
   mating in male rats. One site where glutamate and its NMDA receptors may
   contribute to mating is the medial preoptic area (MPOA), which is vital
   for male sexual behavior. Glutamate is released in the MPOA during
   copulation, and especially at the time of ejaculation. We report here
   that the NMDA antagonist MK-801, microinjected into the MPOA, impaired
   copulatory behavior in sexually naive as well as experienced males. In
   rats tested both as naive and after sexual experience, drug treatment
   produced more profound impairment in naive males. In addition, MK-801,
   microinjected into the MPOA before each of 7 noncopulatory exposures to
   receptive female rats, resulted in copulatory impairments on a drug-free
   test on Day 8, relative to aCSF-treated rats; their behavior was similar
   to that of males that had not been preexposed to females. Therefore,
   NMDA receptors in the MPOA contribute to the control of copulation and
   stimulus sensitization. Glutamate, acting via NMDA receptors, regulates
   many neural functions, including neuronal plasticity. This is the first
   demonstration that a similar mechanism in the MPOA sensitizes male rats
   to the stimuli from a receptive female, and thereby enhances their
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{In sighted humans, light intensity, timing, exposure duration, and
   spectral composition of light are important to entrain the endogenous
   circadian pacemaker to the 24-h day-night cycle. We tested the impact of
   two realistic office lighting conditions during the afternoon on
   subjective sleepiness, hormonal secretion, and cognitive performance in
   the early evening hours. Twenty-nine young subjects came twice and spent
   8 h (12:00-20:00) in our laboratory, where they were exposed for 6 h to
   either artificial light (AL) or to mainly daylight (DL). In the early
   evening, we assessed their salivary cortisol and melatonin secretion,
   subjective sleepiness, and cognitive performance (n-back test) under dim
   light conditions. Subjects felt significantly more alert at the
   beginning of the evening after the DL condition, and they became
   sleepier at the end of the evening after the AL condition. For cognitive
   performance we found a significant interaction between light conditions,
   mental load (2- or 3-back task) and the order of light administration.
   On their first evening, subjects performed with similar accuracy after
   both light conditions, but on their second evening, subjects performed
   significantly more accurately after the DL in both n-back versions and
   committed fewer false alarms in the 2-back task compared to the AL
   group. Lower sleepiness in the evening was significantly correlated with
   better cognitive performance (p < .05). In summary, even short-term
   lighting conditions during the afternoon had an impact on cognitive task
   performance in the evening. This rapid effect was only distinguishable
   on the second day of training, when a difficult task had been
   sufficiently practiced.}},

Abstract = {{The basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) modulates memory for
   emotional events, and direct activation of the BLA following a learning
   session can enhance subsequent memory. Yet optimal enhancement of
   episodic memory during emotional events would likely require that BLA
   activation occur close in time to the event and to be brief enough to
   target specific memories if some events are to be remembered better than
   others. In the present study, rats were given a novel object recognition
   memory task in which initial encounters with some of the objects were
   immediately followed by brief electrical stimulation of the BLA, and
   these objects were remembered better one day later as compared to
   objects for which the initial encounter was not followed by stimulation.
   The results indicated that BLA stimulation can enhance memory for
   individual events, a necessary ability for the BLA to modulate episodic
   memory effectively.}},

Abstract = {{The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COM7) val158met polymorphism has
   received attention in schizophrenia due to its role in prefrontal
   dopamine catabolism. Given the rich dopaminergic innervations of the
   olfactory bulb and the influence of dopamine on the transmission of
   olfactory signals, the authors examined the influence of COMT genotype
   status on the olfactory processing impairment observed in schizophrenia.
   The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test was
   administered unirhinally to individuals with schizophrenia (n = 42) and
   a demographically matched sample of healthy controls (n = 30).
   Individuals were genotyped for the COMT val158met polymorphism. A
   statistically significant interaction of diagnosis and COMT genotype was
   observed, such that schizophrenia heterozygotes and Met homozygotes
   showed impaired odor identification accuracy relative to Val158
   homozygotes. These findings could not be explained by factors such as
   antipsychotic medication status, clinical symptomatology, or demographic
   and illness characteristics. Notably, the schizophrenia Val158
   homozygotes' odor identification performance was comparable to that of
   the control group. These data indicate that odor identification
   impairments observed in schizophrenia are influenced by the COMT
   val158met polymorphism. This relationship is consistent with specific
   dopaminergic modulation of primary olfactory sensory afferents, rather
   than a broader effect on cognitive processes. Future studies that
   examine the olfactory processing deficit in schizophrenia with respect
   to other olfactory measures and COMT haplotypes is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{The present study examined the neural correlates of long-term intense
   romantic love using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Ten
   women and 7 men married an average of 21.4 years underwent fMRI while
   viewing facial images of their partner. Control images included a highly
   familiar acquaintance; a close, long-term friend; and a low-familiar
   person. Effects specific to the intensely loved, long-term partner were
   found in: (i) areas of the dopamine-rich reward and basal ganglia
   system, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and dorsal striatum,
   consistent with results from early-stage romantic love studies; and (ii)
   several regions implicated in maternal attachment, such as the globus
   pallidus (GP), substantia nigra, Raphe nucleus, thalamus, insular
   cortex, anterior cingulate and posterior cingulate. Correlations of
   neural activity in regions of interest with widely used questionnaires
   showed: (i) VTA and caudate responses correlated with romantic love
   scores and inclusion of other in the self; (ii) GP responses correlated
   with friendship-based love scores; (iii) hypothalamus and posterior
   hippocampus responses correlated with sexual frequency; and (iv)
   caudate, septum/fornix, posterior cingulate and posterior hippocampus
   responses correlated with obsession. Overall, results suggest that for
   some individuals the reward-value associated with a long-term partner
   may be sustained, similar to new love, but also involves brain systems
   implicated in attachment and pair-bonding.}},

Title = {{Age-related changes to the neural correlates of social evaluation}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{552-564}},
Abstract = {{Recent work suggests the existence of a specialized neural system
   underlying social processing that may be relatively spared with age,
   unlike pervasive aging-related decline occurring in many cognitive
   domains. We investigated how neural mechanisms underlying social
   evaluation are engaged with age, and how age-related changes to
   socioemotional goals affect recruitment of regions within this network.
   In a functional MRI study, 15 young and 15 older adults formed
   behavior-based impressions of individuals. They also responded to a
   prompt that was interpersonally meaningful, social but interpersonally
   irrelevant, or non-social. Both age groups engaged regions implicated in
   mentalizing and impression formation when making social relative to
   non-social evaluations, including dorsal and ventral medial prefrontal
   cortices, precuneus, and temporoparietal junction. Older adults had
   increased activation over young in right temporal pole when making
   social relative to non-social evaluations, suggesting reliance on past
   experiences when evaluating others. Young adults had greater activation
   than old in posterior cingulate gyrus when making interpersonally
   irrelevant, compared to interpersonally meaningful, evaluations,
   potentially reflecting enhanced valuation of this information. The
   findings demonstrate the age-related preservation of the neural
   correlates underlying social evaluation, and suggest that functioning in
   these regions might be mediated by age-related changes in socioemotional
   goals.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{565-577}},
Abstract = {{When acting and attending together, we take each other's perceptual and
   intentional relations to the environment into account. The present study
   investigated whether people are also sensitive to a co-actor's
   attentional relation to jointly attended events. Two participants sat
   next to each other and performed a two-choice Navon task, responding to
   the identity of letters formed by identical (congruent) or different
   (incongruent) smaller letters while EEG was recorded. Crucially,
   participants either held the same focus of attention (e. g., both
   attending to local stimulus features) or different foci of attention (e.
   g., one attending to local and the other to global features). Results
   revealed a significant slow-down of responses when participants focused
   on different features. Amplitudes of the occipital P1 and parietal
   occipital P3 decreased when attentional foci differed. The amplitude of
   the fronto-central N2 increased when the other attended to local as
   compared to global features. These results suggest that representations
   of a co-actor's task can include a specification of his or her focus of
   attention. Taking into account the other's different attentional
   relation to stimuli likely induces a conflict at the level of task
   selection, impairing early allocation of attention (P1) and enhancing
   the need to monitor response initiation (P3).}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{578-590}},
Abstract = {{When perceiving imminent harm to others, quickly detecting potential
   hazards to oneself should be vital. In this case, mirroring the outcome
   of observed actions appears paradoxical. This study measured
   electroencephalographic/event-related potentials and mu suppression that
   were induced by dynamic animations; each animation was composed of three
   consecutive pictures depicting an individual being accidentally injured.
   The results indicated that the first picture evoked frontal N260 and
   central N360, the possible brain source of which is estimated in the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the third picture elicited late
   positive potentials, the possible sources of which might be generated
   from the insular and mid-cingulate cortex. Differential mu suppression,
   in relation to the sensorimotor resonance of empathy for pain, is
   associated with the third picture containing the crucial affective
   valence, but not with the first picture. The masking procedure on the
   third picture attenuated this mu suppression. Mediation analysis further
   confirmed that sensorimotor resonance is not a significant mediator in
   predicting subjective unpleasantness for observed actions. The findings
   suggest that sensorimotor resonance is not a platform, but rather an
   outcome when anticipating harm to others.}},

   cortex in behavior understanding and trait identification}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{591-605}},
Abstract = {{It has been suggested that the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) is
   involved in inferring immediate goals and intentions from behaviors,
   whereas the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) integrates social
   information, such as traits, at a more abstract level. To explore the
   differential role of the TPJ and mPFC, participants read several verbal
   descriptions about an agent. Embedded in a factorial design, in one-half
   of the trials (behavior condition), the agent was engaged in a simple
   goal-directed behavior, whereas in the other half this description was
   absent. In another half of the trials (trait condition), the
   participants had to answer a question about a trait of the agent,
   whereas in the other half the question was about the agent's physical
   appearance. The results revealed that the dorsal mPFC was recruited when
   participants inferred the agent's trait, irrespective of a behavioral
   description. In contrast, the TPJ, posterior superior temporal sulcus
   (pSTS), anterior intraparietal sulcus, and premotor cortex were
   activated when goal-directed behavioral information was presented,
   irrespective of a trait question. These findings confirm that in a
   social context, the TPJ (and pSTS) is activated for understanding
   goal-directed behaviors, whereas the mPFC is involved in processing
   traits.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{606-621}},
Abstract = {{It has been proposed that common codes for vision and action emerge from
   associations between an individual's production and simultaneous
   observation of actions. This typically first-person view of one's own
   action subsequently transfers to the third-person view when observing
   another individual. We tested vision-action associations and the
   transfer from first-person to third-person perspective by comparing
   novel hand-action sequences that were learned under three conditions:
   first, by being performed and simultaneously viewed from a first-person
   perspective; second, by being performed but not seen; and third, by
   being seen from a first-person view without being executed. We then used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare the response to
   these three types of learned action sequences when they were presented
   from a third-person perspective. Visuomotor areas responded most
   strongly to sequences that were learned by simultaneously producing and
   observing the action sequences. We also note an important asymmetry
   between vision and action: Action sequences learned by performance
   alone, in the absence of vision, facilitated the emergence of visuomotor
   responses, whereas action sequences learned by viewing alone had
   comparably little effect. This dominance of action over vision supports
   the notion of forward/predictive models of visuomotor systems.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{622-631}},
Abstract = {{Previous research has demonstrated that an early attentional component
   of the event-related potential (ERP), the P2, is sensitive to the
   distinction between the processing of racial outgroup and ingroup faces
   but may not be sensitive to the distinction between racially ambiguous
   and ingroup faces. Recent behavioral work, however, has suggested that
   contextual information may affect the processing of racially ambiguous
   faces. Thus, the first goal of this study was to examine whether the
   early neural processing of racially ambiguous faces would be affected by
   primed stereotypes. White college student participants (n = 29)
   completed a task in which they racially categorized monoracial Black and
   White faces and racially ambiguous Black-White morphs. These faces were
   preceded by positive and negative Black and White stereotypical primes.
   Results indicated that P2 amplitude to the racially ambiguous faces was
   moderated by the valence of the primes such that negative primes led to
   greater neural processing of the racially ambiguous faces than positive
   primes. Furthermore, the extent to which P2 amplitude was affected by
   prime valence was moderated by individual differences in preference for
   structure and categorical thinking, as well as comfort with ambiguity.}},

Abstract = {{Social cognitive neuroscience is a recent interdisciplinary field that
   studies the neural basis of the social mind. Event-related potentials
   (ERPs) provide precise information about the time dynamics of the brain.
   In this study, we assess the role of ERPs in cognitive neuroscience,
   particularly in the emerging area of social neuroscience. First, we
   briefly introduce the technique of ERPs. Subsequently, we describe
   several ERP components (P1, N1, N170, vertex positive potential, early
   posterior negativity, N2, P2, P3, N400, N400-like, late positive
   complex, late positive potential, P600, error-related negativity,
   feedback error-related negativity, contingent negative variation,
   readiness potential, lateralized readiness potential, motor potential,
   re-afferent potential) that assess perceptual, cognitive, and motor
   processing. Then, we introduce ERP studies in social neuroscience on
   contextual effects on speech, emotional processing, empathy, and
   decision making. We provide an outline of ERPs' relevance and
   applications in the field of social cognitive neuroscience. We also
   introduce important methodological issues that extend classical ERP
   research, such as intracranial recordings (iERP) and source location in
   dense arrays and simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging
   recordings. Further, this review discusses possible caveats of the ERP
   question assessment on neuroanatomical areas, biophysical origin, and
   methodological problems, and their relevance to explanatory pluralism
   and multilevel, contextual, and situated approaches to social
   neuroscience.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{650-661}},
Abstract = {{A foundational aspect of early social-emotional development is the
   ability to detect and respond to the actions of others who are
   coordinating their behavior with that of the self. Behavioral work in
   this area has found that infants show particular preferences for adults
   who are imitating them rather than adults who are carrying out
   noncontingent or mismatching actions. Here, we explore the neural
   processes related to this tendency of infants to prefer others who act
   like the self. Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals were recorded from
   14-month-old infants while they were observing actions that either
   matched or mismatched the action the infant had just executed.
   Desynchronization of the EEG mu rhythm was greater when infants observed
   an action that matched their own most recently executed action. This
   effect was strongest immediately prior to the culmination of the goal of
   the observed action, which is consistent with recent ideas about the
   predictive nature of brain responses during action observation.}},

Abstract = {{Religious beliefs are both catchy and durable: They exhibit a high
   degree of adherence to our cognitive system, given their success of
   transmission and spreading throughout history. A prominent explanation
   for religion's cultural success comes from the ``MCI hypothesis,{''}
   according to which religious beliefs are both easy to recall and
   desirable to transmit because they are minimally counterintuitive (MCI).
   This hypothesis has been empirically tested at concept and narrative
   levels by recall measures. However, the neural correlates of MCI
   concepts remain poorly understood. We used the N400 component of the
   event-related brain potential as a measure of counterintuitiveness of
   violations comparing religious and non-religious sentences, both
   counterintuitive, when presented in isolation. Around 80\% in either
   condition were core-knowledge violations. We found smaller N400
   amplitudes for religious as compared to non-religious counterintuitive
   ideas, suggesting that religious ideas are less semantically anomalous.
   Moreover, behavioral measures revealed that religious ideas are not
   readily detected as unacceptable. Finally, systematic analyses of our
   materials, according to conceptual features proposed in cognitive models
   of religion, did not reveal any outstanding variable significantly
   contributing to these differences. Refinements of cognitive models of
   religion should elucidate which combination of factors renders an
   anomaly less counterintuitive and thus more suitable for recall and
   transmission.}},

Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{458-472}},
Abstract = {{Available evidence suggests that infants use adults' social cues for
   learning by the second half of the first year of life. However, little
   is known about the short-term or long-term effects of joint attention
   interactions on learning and memory in younger infants. In the present
   study, 4-month-old infants were familiarized with visually presented
   objects in either of two conditions that differed in the degree of joint
   attention (high vs. low). Brain activity in response to familiar and
   novel objects was assessed immediately after the familiarization phase
   (immediate recognition), and following a 1-week delay (delayed
   recognition). The latency of the Nc component differentiated between
   recognition of old versus new objects. Pb amplitude and latency were
   affected by joint attention in delayed recognition. Moreover, the
   frequency of infant gaze to the experimenter during familiarization
   differed between the two experimental groups and modulated the Pb
   response. Results show that joint attention affects the mechanisms of
   long-term retention in 4-month-old infants. We conclude that joint
   attention helps children at this young age to recognize the relevance of
   learned items.}},

Title = {{The neural substrates of social emotion perception and regulation are
   modulated by adult attachment style}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{473-493}},
Abstract = {{Adult attachment style (AAS) refers to individual differences in the way
   people experience and regulate their social relationships and
   corresponding emotions. Based on developmental and psychological
   research, it has been hypothesized that avoidant attachment style (AV)
   entails deactivating strategies in social contexts, whereas anxious
   attachment style (AX) involves hyper vigilance and up-regulation
   mechanisms. However, the neural substrates of differences in social
   emotion regulation associated with AAS have not been systematically
   investigated. Here we used fMRI in 19 healthy adults to investigate the
   effect of AAS on the processing of pleasant or unpleasant social and
   nonsocial scenes. Participants were asked either to naturally attend
   (NAT), cognitively reappraise (REAP), or behaviorally suppress (ESUP)
   their emotional responses. Avoidantly attached participants showed
   increased prefrontal and anterior cingulate activation to social
   negative scenes when making spontaneous emotion judgments. They also
   exhibited persistent increases in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and
   left amygdala activity for the same stimuli during reappraisal, as well
   as additional activation in supplementary motor area and ventral caudate
   during the suppression of social positive emotions. These results
   suggest that AV may imply less efficient reappraisal strategies to
   regulate social negative emotions, and lead to higher conflict or
   effortful control when suppression cannot be employed. In contrast,
   anxiously attached participants showed differential increases in the
   right amygdala and left parahippocampal cortex for social negative and
   positive stimuli, respectively, but only when making spontaneous emotion
   judgments. No effect of AX was found during down-regulation conditions.
   This suggests heightened arousal to negative information without
   difficulty in down-regulating emotions through cognitive re-evaluation
   or suppression. Taken together, these findings reveal for the first time
   the neural underpinnings of attachment-related differences in social
   emotion regulation.}},

Title = {{The cognitive demands on cooperation in social dilemmas: An fMRI study}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{494-509}},
Abstract = {{This study uses fMRI to investigate the cognitive demands of
   decision-making in two types of cooperation games: a prisoner's dilemma
   (PD) eliciting a temptation to free-ride, leading to a dominant,
   self-interested response, and a stag hunt (SH) that has no dominant
   response but offers pay-off incentives that make mutual cooperation
   collectively beneficial but risky. Consequently, the PD poses greater
   conflict between self-and collective interest, greater demands for
   computational reasoning to derive the optimal solution, and greater
   demands for mentalizing to infer the intentions of others. Consistent
   with these differences between the two games, the results indicate that
   the PD is associated with increased activity in the anterior cingulate
   gyrus, prefrontal cortex, parietal lobe, and temporoparietal junction.
   With less conflict, the demands for computation and mentalizing are
   reduced in the SH, and cooperation levels increase dramatically. The
   differences in brain activation elicited by the different incentive
   structures of the PD and the SH appear to be independent of individual
   differences in revealed social preferences.}},

Title = {{Stop laughing! Humor perception with and without expressive suppression}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{510-524}},
Abstract = {{The neurophysiological study of emotion regulation focused on the
   strategy of reappraisal-i.e., the cognitive reinterpretation of a
   stimulus. Reappraisal reduces emotional expression, the experience of
   both negative and positive feelings, and the amplitude of an
   event-related potential (ERP)-the late positive potential (LPP). In
   contrast, the strategy of expressive suppression (ES), being the
   inhibition of emotional expression, has been reported to reduce
   subjective feelings of positive, but not negative emotion, and has not
   yet been investigated with ERPs. We focused on the LPP to assess the
   correlates of ES in the context of humor perception. Twenty-two female
   participants rated sequences of humorous (H) and non-humorous (NH)
   pictures, while their zygomaticus muscle was recorded. A spontaneous
   (SP) condition, in which participants attended naturally to the
   pictures, resulted in higher ratings of funniness, increased smiling,
   and increased LPP amplitude for H compared to NH stimuli. An ES
   condition, in which participants suppressed their facial reactions,
   resulted in reduced smiling, without affecting subjective ratings. LPP
   amplitude did not differ between H and NH stimuli during ES, suggesting
   equal allocation of processing resources to both stimuli. These results
   suggest that, similarly to reappraisal, ES modifies the way the brain
   processes positive emotional stimuli.}},

Title = {{Investigating the impact of parental status and depression symptoms on

   study}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{525-536}},
Abstract = {{Infant faces are highly salient social stimuli that appear to elicit
   intuitive parenting behaviors in healthy adult women. Behavioral and
   observational studies indicate that this effect may be modulated by
   experiences of reproduction, caregiving, and psychiatric symptomatology
   that affect normative attention and reward processing of infant cues.
   However, relatively little is known about the neural correlates of these
   effects. Using the event-related potential (ERP) technique, this study
   investigated the impact of parental status (mother, non-mother) and
   depression symptoms on early visual processing of infant faces in a
   community sample of adult women. Specifically, the P1 and N170 ERP
   components elicited in response to infant face stimuli were examined.
   While characteristics of the N170 were not modulated by parental status,
   a statistically significant positive correlation was observed between
   depression symptom severity and N170 amplitude. This relationship was
   not observed for the P1. These results suggest that depression symptoms
   may modulate early neurophysiological responsiveness to infant cues,
   even at sub-clinical levels.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{537-551}},
Abstract = {{Research findings show that proposers make surprisingly fair offers in
   the ultimatum and dictator games, an observation that contradicts
   predictions of classical game theory. The present functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) study examines brain activities of proposers
   that contribute to fair and unfair behaviors. We hypothesized that
   egoistic and altruistic motives of proposers affect fairness
   differentially in the two games. fMRI analysis revealed that the 28\% of
   fair offers in the present ultimatum game were related to enhanced
   activity in prefrontal areas, in particular, in regions involved in
   reward and theory of mind. This corroborates the idea that egoistic
   motives are primarily responsible for fair offers in this game, which we
   denote as strategic fairness. Fair offers in the dictator game, however,
   were related to increased activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate
   cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex. This supports the idea that
   altruistic motives primarily drive fair offers in the dictator game,
   denoted here as altruistic fairness.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{331-346}},
Abstract = {{Human peer relations provide tangible benefits, including food and
   protection, as well as emotional benefits. While social exclusion poses
   a threat to all of these benefits, the psychological threat is
   particularly susceptible to modulation by the relation of the excluders
   to the excluded person. The current study used functional magnetic
   resonance imaging to explore the effects of manipulating the gender
   relation of participants to their excluders during an interactive
   ball-toss game. Ventral anterior cingulate cortex activation was higher
   during exclusion by same-gender peers, while right ventrolateral
   prefrontal cortex activation negatively correlated with self-reported
   distress in other-gender exclusion. Results imply that exclusion by
   one's own gender is fundamentally different from exclusion by the
   opposite gender, and suggest a regulatory role for ventrolateral
   prefrontal cortex in response to out-group exclusion. Individual
   differences in implicit gender attitudes modulated neural responses to
   exclusion. The importance of these findings to investigations of social
   cognition is discussed.}},

Title = {{Neural evidence for reduced apprehensiveness of familiarized stimuli in
   a mere exposure paradigm}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{347-358}},
Abstract = {{Mere familiarization with a stimulus increases liking for it or similar
   stimuli ({''}mere exposure{''} effects) as well as perceptual fluency,
   indexed by the speed and accuracy of categorizing it or similar stimuli
   ({''}priming{''} effects). Candidate mechanisms proposed to explain mere
   exposure effects include both increased positive affect associated with
   greater perceptual fluency, and reduced negative affect associated with
   diminished apprehensiveness of novel stimuli. Although these two
   mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, it is difficult for behavioral
   measures to disentangle them, since increased liking or other indices of
   greater positive affect toward exposed stimuli could result from
   increases in positive feelings or decreases in negative feelings or
   both. The present study sought to clarify this issue by building on
   research showing a dissociation at the neural level in which the lateral
   orbitofrontal cortex (LOFC) is activated more by negatively valenced
   than by neutral or positively valenced stimuli, with the reverse effect
   for medial orbitofrontal cortex (MOFC). Supporting the reduced
   apprehensiveness hypothesis, we found lower LOFC activation to
   familiarized faces and objects (repetition suppression). We did not find
   evidence to support the positive affect hypothesis in increased
   activation to familiarized stimuli in MOFC or in other parts of the
   reward circuit that respond more to positively valenced stimuli
   (repetition enhancement), although enhancement effects were shown in
   some regions.}},

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{In the present research we investigated whether the direction of the

   self and other. We used inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic
   stimulation (rTMS) trains over the right and left parietal cortex to
   investigate the role of these regions in the task. Following right
   parietal rTMS, the self face is perceived as closer when it is located
   at the right line endpoint; following left parietal rTMS, the self face
   is perceived as closer when it is located at the left line endpoint. In
   both cases, the side of space ipsilateral to the rTMS is underestimated
   from an attentional point of view, while it is overestimated from a
   social point of view. These results are a projection of how an

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{373-384}},
Abstract = {{Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetic condition with a distinctive social
   phenotype characterized by excessive sociability accompanied by a
   relative proficiency in face recognition, despite severe deficits in the
   visuospatial domain of cognition. This consistent phenotypic
   characteristic and the relative homogeneity of the WS genotype make WS a
   compelling human model for examining genotype-phenotype relations,
   especially with respect to social behavior. Following up on a recent
   report suggesting that individuals with WS do not show race bias and
   racial stereotyping, this study was designed to investigate the neural
   correlates of the perception of faces from different races, in
   individuals with WS as compared to typically developing (TD) controls.
   Caucasian WS and TD participants performed a gender identification task
   with own-race (White) and other-race (Black) faces while event-related
   potentials (ERPs) were recorded. In line with previous studies with TD
   participants, other-race faces elicited larger amplitude ERPs within the
   first 200 ms following the face onset, in WS and TD participants alike.
   These results suggest that, just like their TD counterparts, individuals
   with WS differentially processed faces of own-race versus other-race, at
   relatively early stages of processing, starting as early as 115 ms after
   the face onset. Overall, these results indicate that neural processing
   of faces in individuals with WS is moderated by race at early perceptual
   stages, calling for a reconsideration of the previous claim that they
   are uniquely insensitive to race.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{385-397}},
Abstract = {{In adapting our behavior to a rapidly changing environment, we also tune
   our behavior to that of others. To investigate the neural bases of such
   adaptive mechanisms, we examined how individuals adjust their actions
   after decision-conflicts observed in others compared to self-experienced
   conflicts. Participants responded to the color of a stimulus, while its
   spatial position elicited either a conflicting or a congruent action.
   Participants were required either to respond to stimuli themselves or to
   observe the response of another participant. We studied the difference
   between interference effects following conflicting or congruent stimuli,
   an effect known as conflict adaptation. Consistent with earlier reports,
   we found that the implementation of reactive control, following
   congruent trials, was accompanied by activation of the right inferior
   frontal cortex. Individual differences in the efficacy of response
   inhibition covaried with the level of activation in that region.
   Sustaining proactive control, following incongruent trials, activated
   the left lateral prefrontal cortex. Most importantly, adaptive controls
   induced by decision-conflicts observed in others, as well as the
   associated prefrontal activations, were comparable to those induced by
   self-experienced conflicts. We show that in both behavioral and neural
   terms we adapt to conflicts happening to others just as if they happened

Abstract = {{Currently, potential jurors' racial biases are measured by explicit
   questioning-a poor measure because people often hide their views to
   adhere to social norms, and people have implicit views they are not
   consciously aware of. In this experiment, we investigated whether two
   alternative methods of measuring racial bias-a standard Black/White,
   good/bad Implicit Association Test (IAT) and neural activity, measured
   by fMRI, in response to seeing faces of Black and White
   individuals-could predict how much money subjects would award Black
   victims in hypothetical employment discrimination cases. IAT scores
   failed to predict how much money subjects awarded victims. However, in
   right inferior parietal lobule (BA 40) and in right superior/middle
   frontal gyrus (BA 9/10)-which have both previously been implicated in
   measuring biases and implicit preferences-the difference in neural
   activity between when subjects viewed Black faces paired with neutral
   adjectives and when subjects viewed White faces paired with neutral
   adjectives was positively correlated with the amount of money the
   subjects awarded victims. This suggests that brain activity measures
   racial bias with more practical validity, at least in this situation and
   with our sample size, than a common behavioral measure (the IAT).}},

Title = {{Seeing minds: A neurophilosophical investigation of the role of
   perception-action coupling in social perception}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{410-423}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes an empirical hypothesis that in some cases of social
   interaction we have an immediate perceptual access to others' minds in
   the perception of their embodied intentionality. Our point of departure
   is the phenomenological insight that there is an experiential difference
   in the perception of embodied intentionality and the perception of
   non-intentionality. The other's embodied intentionality is perceptually
   given in a way that is different from the givenness of
   non-intentionality. We claim that the phenomenological difference in the
   perception of embodied intentionality and non-intentionality translates
   into an account of how, in some cases of social cognition, we perceive
   mental properties in the perception of embodied intentionality. The
   hypothesis derives support from a host of recent empirical studies in
   social neuroscience which demonstrate the importance of embodied
   engagements in understanding other minds. These studies reveal that
   embodied intersubjective interaction often builds on our ability to
   understand other minds in an immediate perceptual way not adequately
   investigated by theory-theory (TT) and simulation theories (ST) of
   mind-reading. We argue that there is a genuine, nontrivial difference in
   the informational content of the perception of embodied intentionality
   and the perception of non-intentionality which leads to a further
   difference in the way information is processed in the case of perception
   of embodied intentionality as opposed to the perception of
   non-intentionality. The full significance of such difference is
   appreciated only within an account of perception which views perception
   and action as tightly coupled. Thus, we propose an ``action-oriented
   account of social perception{''} to develop a neurophilosophical account
   of the perceptual knowledge of other minds.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to attribute mental states to others and understand the
   basis of their decisions is essential for human social interaction. A
   controversial theory states that this is achieved by simulating
   another's information processing in one's own neural circuits. The
   anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is known to play an important role in
   the registration of discrepancies between the predicted and actual
   outcomes of decisions (prediction errors). When positive and negative
   feedback fails altogether, the failure may also signal errors in the
   prediction that the outcome of that decision would be informative and
   guide future decisions. Does the ACC signal that an outcome is
   unexpectedly uninformative? When an outcome directed to others is
   uninformative, do we understand their mental states by simulating them
   in the circuits of the ACC in our own brain? The aim of our study was to
   test for these two possibilities in the human brain with event-related
   fMRI. We tested whether the ACC processes errors in the prediction of
   informative feedback and whether the ACC is also activated when scanned
   subjects process the same outcomes of another's decisions. We show that
   each is processed by a separate subregion of the ACC.}},

Abstract = {{Both emotional images and human faces are particularly salient compared
   to other categories of visual stimuli. The late positive potential (LPP)
   is larger for emotional than neutral images, and some evidence suggests
   that the LPP is further enhanced for images containing people. Studies
   of emotion frequently compare pleasant and unpleasant IAPS pictures to
   neutral, without an explicit understanding of how the presence of faces
   in these images may affect attentional allocation and
   psychophysiological response. The present experiment examined the effect
   of faces on the LPP elicited by neutral and threatening IAPS images. The
   LPP was enhanced by faces in neutral images, but no difference was
   observed between threatening images with and without faces. These
   results demonstrate that the inclusion of faces in IAPS images
   significantly impacts the LPP; however, this effect is unique to neutral
   images.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) show impaired emotional
   responses to self-face processing, but the underlying neural bases are
   unclear. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated
   brain activity when 15 individuals with high-functioning ASD and 15
   controls rated the photogenicity of self-face images and photographs of
   others' faces. Controls showed a strong correlation between
   photogenicity ratings and extent of embarrassment evoked by self-face
   images; this correlation was weaker among ASD individuals, indicating a
   decoupling between the cognitive evaluation of self-face images and
   emotional responses. Individuals with ASD demonstrated relatively low
   self-related activity in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), which was
   related to specific autistic traits. There were significant group
   differences in the modulation of activity by embarrassment ratings in
   the right insular (IC) and lateral orbitofrontal cortices. Task-related
   activity in the right IC was lower in the ASD group. The reduced
   activity in the right IC for self-face images was associated with weak
   coupling between cognitive evaluation and emotional responses to
   self-face images. The PCC is responsible for self-referential
   processing, and the IC plays a role in emotional experience. Dysfunction
   in these areas could contribute to the lack of self-conscious behaviors
   in response to self-reflection in ASD individuals.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{240-251}},
Abstract = {{Previous research has demonstrated that early attentional components of
   the event-related potential (ERP) reflect differential attention to race
   during person perception. There is also evidence that inconsistency
   between stereotypic information following impression formation leads to
   greater neural processing in later ERP components. However, research has
   not examined how expectancy violations following impression formation
   affect the early attentional processing of race. The current study
   examined this issue by leading White participants to form impressions of
   targets based on positive or negative behaviors associated with
   stereotypes about Blacks or Whites, with the purpose of creating an
   expectation of Black or White targets. Following each impression
   formation trial, a target face whose race either violated or confirmed
   this expectancy was displayed. Participants indicated whether this
   target could have performed the previous behavior. Results demonstrated
   that reaction times and early attentional components of the ERP varied
   as a function of the match between expectancy and the race of target
   faces, with stereotypic expectancy violating trials yielding longer
   reaction times and greater N1 and N2 amplitudes than
   expectancy-confirming trials. Implications for impression formation and
   person perception are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We examined how individual differences in mood and anxiety in the early
   postpartum period are related to brain response to infant stimuli during
   fMRI, with particular focus on regions implicated in both maternal
   behavior and mood/anxiety, that is, the subgenual anterior cingulate
   cortex (sgACC) and the amygdala. At approximately 3 months postpartum,
   22 mothers completed an affect-rating task (ART) during fMRI, where
   their affective response to infant stimuli was explicitly probed.
   Mothers viewed/rated four infant face conditions: own positive (OP), own
   negative (ON), unfamiliar positive (UP), and unfamiliar negative (UN).
   Mood and anxiety were measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression
   Scale (EDPS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait Version
   (STAI-T); maternal factors related to parental stress and attachment
   were also assessed. Brain-imaging data underwent a random-effects
   analysis, and cluster-based statistical thresholding was applied to the
   following contrasts: OP-UP, ON-UN, OP-ON, and UP-UN. Our main finding
   was that poorer quality of maternal experience was significantly related
   to reduced amygdala response to OP compared to UP infant faces. Our
   results suggest that, in human mothers, infant-related amygdala function
   may be an important factor in maternal anxiety/mood, in quality of
   mothering, and in individual differences in the motivation to mother.}},

Title = {{Finding faults: How moral dilemmas illuminate cognitive structure}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{269-279}},
Abstract = {{Philosophy is rife with intractable moral dilemmas. We propose that
   these debates often exist because competing psychological systems yield
   different answers to the same problem. Consequently, philosophical
   debate points to the natural fault lines between dissociable
   psychological mechanisms, and as such provides a useful guide for
   cognitive neuroscience. We present two case studies from recent research
   into moral judgment: dilemmas concerning whether to harm a person in
   order to save several others, and whether to punish individuals for
   harms caused accidentally. Finally, we analyze two features of mental
   conflict that apparently contribute to philosophical discord: the
   insistence that one answer to a problem must be correct
   ({''}non-negotiability{''}) and the absence of an independent means of
   determining the correct answer ({''}non-adjudicability{''}).}},

   traits and social identities}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{280-291}},
Abstract = {{Cross-cultural studies have shown that personality traits are less
   central and social identities are more important to the selfhood of
   collectivistic people. However, most cultural neuroscience studies using
   the self-reference effect (SRE) paradigm have only used personality
   traits to explore cultural differences in the neural circuits of
   self-referential processes. In the present study, we used both
   personality traits and social identities as stimuli in the SRE paradigm
   and investigated whether and how one's cultural orientation (i.e.,
   individualism vs. collectivism) affects the SRE in the brain. The
   results showed that the medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate,
   bilateral temporoparietal regions, and precuneus were involved in
   self-representation for both personality traits and social identities.
   Importantly, cultural orientation predicted differential activation
   patterns in these regions. Collectivists showed stronger activation in
   the left temporoparietal regions than individualists, who mainly
   recruited the medial prefrontal regions. Our findings suggest that the
   personal and social self share common neural substrates, the activation
   of which can be modulated by one's cultural orientation.}},

Title = {{The impact of one night of sleep deprivation on moral judgments}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{292-300}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown the existence of a relationship between sleep
   and moral judgment. In this study, we investigated whether one night of
   sleep deprivation affects the ability to judge the appropriateness of
   moral dilemmas. Forty-eight students had to judge 30 moral dilemmas at
   test, after a night of home sleep, and another 30 dilemmas at retest,
   following one night of continuous wakefulness. The 60 dilemmas (20 moral
   impersonal, 20 moral personal, and 20 non-moral) were selected from
   Greene's dilemmas. Both groups judged the appropriateness of personal
   and impersonal dilemmas in the same way. A close to significant effect
   of sleep deprivation was observed on the reaction times for impersonal
   moral dilemmas, to which the deprived subjects responded faster (p =
   .05) than the control subjects. However, this was not the case for
   personal ones, for which no difference was significant. This result
   shows a greater ease/speed in responding to the (impersonal) dilemmas,
   which induce low emotional engagement after sleep deprivation, although
   the willingness to accept moral violations is not affected. This
   suggests that one night of sleep loss selectively influences the
   response speed only for moral impersonal dilemmas, probably due to
   disinhibition processes. The quality of moral judgment dilemmas does not
   seem to be easily influenced by a single night of sleep deprivation, but
   only by a longer lack of sleep.}},

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{301-310}},
Abstract = {{Typical adult observers demonstrate enhanced behavioral sensitivity to
   human movement compared to animal movement. Yet, the neural
   underpinnings of this effect are unknown. We examined the tuning of
   brain mechanisms for the perception of biological motion to the social
   relevance of this category of motion by comparing neural response to
   human and non-human biological motion. In particular, we tested the
   hypothesis that the response of the right posterior superior temporal
   sulcus (pSTS) varies according to the social relevance of the motion,
   responding most strongly to those biological motions with the greatest
   social relevance (human > dog). During a functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) session, typical adults viewed veridical point-light
   displays of human, dog, and tractor motions created from motion capture
   data. A conjunction analysis identified regions of significant
   activation during biological motion perception relative to object
   motion. Within each of these regions, only one brain area, the right
   pSTS, revealed an enhanced response to human motion relative to dog
   motion. This finding demonstrates that the pSTS response is sensitive to
   the social relevance of a biological motion stimulus.}},

Abstract = {{How specialized is the infant brain for processing voice within our

   cortical location of voice-selective activation, as well as the age of
   onset of this response. The current study used functional near-infrared
   spectroscopy (fNIRS) to further investigate voice processing in awake
   4-7-month-old infants. In listening to voice and non-voice sounds, there
   was robust and widespread activation in bilateral temporal cortex.
   Further, voice-selective regions of the bilateral anterior temporal
   cortex evidenced a steady increase in voice selective activation (voice
   > non-voice activation) over 4-7 months of age. These findings support a
   growing body of evidence that the emergence of cerebral specialization
   for human voice sounds evolves over the first 6 months of age.}},

   will discuss early assumptions of domain-specificity in moral

   Participants played the role of ``recipient{''} in the dictator game, in
   which an anonymous ``dictator{''} decides how to split an amount of
   money between himself and the recipient. A subset of recipients was
   given a monetary incentive to be angry at low-split offers. That subset
   demonstrated increased physiological arousal at low offers relative to
   high offers as well as more anger than other participants. These results

Abstract = {{Previous neuroimaging studies support the assumption of a strong link
   between perception and action, demonstrating that the motor system is
   involved when others' actions are observed. One question that is still
   open to debate is which aspects of observed actions engage the motor
   system. The present study tested whether motor activation corresponds to
   the difficulty of the observed action, using Fitts's law. This law
   postulates that the difficulty of any movement (ID) is a function of the
   distance to the target (A) and the target width (W). In an observation
   task, the ID of the observed action was manipulated orthogonally to W
   (by using five different As). The results revealed activity in the
   primary motor cortex, the supplementary motor area, and the basal
   ganglia in response to increasing ID levels, but not in response to
   different levels of A or W. Thus, activation in the motor system during
   action observation is not driven by perceptual parameters but by the
   motor difficulty of the observed action.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{42-58}},
Abstract = {{Social animals adjust their behavior according to social relationships
   and momentary circumstances. Dominant-submissive relationships modulate,
   but do not completely determine, their competitive behaviors. For
   example, a submissive monkey's decision to retrieve food depends not
   only on the presence of dominant partners but also on their observed
   behavior. Thus, behavioral expression requires a dynamic evaluation of
   reward outcome and momentary social states. The neural mechanisms
   underlying this evaluation remain elusive. The caudate nucleus (CN)
   plays a pivotal role in representing reward expectation and translating
   it into action selection. To investigate whether their activities encode
   social state information, we recorded from CN neurons in monkeys while
   they performed a competitive food-grab task against a dominant
   competitor. We found two groups of CN neurons: one primarily responded
   to reward outcome, while the other primarily tracked the monkey's social
   state. These social state-dependent neurons showed greater activity when
   the monkeys freely retrieved food without active challenges from the
   competitor and reduced activity when the monkeys were in a submissive
   state due to the competitor's active behavior. These results indicate
   that different neuronal activities in the CN encode social state
   information and reward-related information, which may contribute to
   adjusting competitive behavior in dynamic social contexts.}},

   difference, and self-assessment system}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{59-73}},
Abstract = {{Mate choice is an example of sophisticated daily decision making
   supported by multiple componential processes. In mate-choice literature,
   different characteristics of the value dimensions, including the sex
   difference in the value dimensions, and the involvement of
   self-assessment due to the mutual nature of the choice, have been
   suggested. We examined whether the brain-activation pattern during
   virtual mate choice would be congruent with these characteristics in
   terms of stimulus selectivity and activated brain regions. In measuring
   brain activity, young men and women were shown two pictures of either
   faces or behaviors, and they indicated which person they would choose
   either as a spouse or as a friend. Activation selective to spouse choice
   was observed face-selectively in men's amygdala and behavior-selectively
   in women's motor system. During both partner-choice conditions,
   behavior-selective activation was observed in the temporoparietal
   regions. Taking the available knowledge of these regions into account,
   these results are congruent with the suggested characteristics of value
   dimensions for physical attractiveness, parenting resources, and
   beneficial personality traits for a long-lasting relationship,
   respectively. The medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices
   were nonselectively activated during the partner choices, suggesting the
   involvement of a self-assessment process. The results thus provide
   neuroscientific support for the multi-component mate-choice mechanism.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{74-89}},
Abstract = {{Although shyness is presumed to be related to an increased sensitivity
   to detect motivationally salient social stimuli, we know little of how
   shyness affects the early perception of facial emotions. We demonstrate
   here that individual differences in normative shyness were related to
   brain responses to some emotional faces as early as the P1
   electrocortical component, 80-130 ms after stimulus onset. High-shy
   individuals showed reduced P1 amplitude for fearful faces compared to
   neutral faces. Low-shy individuals processed happy faces faster than
   other emotions and showed increased P1 amplitudes for happy faces over
   neutral faces. Regardless of shyness level, participants showed
   increased amplitudes in the N170 component (130-200 ms) for all emotions
   over neutral conditions, particularly for the emotion of fear. This
   study presents the first evidence that shyness is related to early
   electrocortical responses to the processing of fearful faces, consistent
   with a fast-path amygdala sensitivity model.}},

   Low-frequency rTMS reduces implicit gender stereotypes}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{90-104}},
Abstract = {{By nature, stereotypes require processes of categorization or semantic
   association, including social information about groups of people. There
   is empirical evidence that the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) processes
   domain-general semantic information, and supports social knowledge. A
   recent study showed that inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic
   stimulation (rTMS) to the ATL reduced racial stereotypes on an implicit
   association test (IAT). However, it was not determined whether this was
   caused by changes to specific social, or general semantic processing, or
   both. The current study addresses these theoretical issues. The design
   investigated the effect of rTMS to the left or right ATL, or a sham
   stimulation, on a social IAT (gender stereotypes), a non-social IAT
   (living versus non-living associations), and a non-semantic control
   (Stroop) task. The results showed that low-frequency rTMS to both left
   and right ATL significantly reduced D-scores on the gender IAT compared
   to the sham group; however, there were no differences on the non-social
   IAT or the Stroop. The findings show the ATL has a role in mediating
   stereotypes, and the decrease of bias after stimulation could be due to
   weakening of social stereotypical associations either within the ATL or
   via a network of brain regions connected with the ATL.}},

Title = {{Positive priming and intentional binding: Eye-blink rate predicts reward
   information effects on the sense of agency}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{105-112}},
Abstract = {{Human society is strongly rooted in people's experiences of agency; that
   is, the pervasive feeling that one engages in voluntary behavior and
   causes one's own actions and resulting outcomes. Rewards and positive
   affect play an important role in the control of voluntary action.
   However, the role of positive reward signals in the sense of agency is
   poorly understood. This study examined effects of reward-related
   information on the sense of agency by employing the intentional binding
   paradigm. This paradigm measures the extent to which actions and their
   effects subjectively shift together across time, reflecting a crucial
   component of people's sense of agency. Results showed that intentional
   binding is stronger when participants are primed with reward-related
   information via brief exposure to positive pictures. Interestingly, this
   positive priming effect was moderated by baseline eye-blink rates (an
   indirect marker of striatal dopaminergic functioning); reward-related
   information increased intentional binding mainly for participants
   displaying higher baseline eye-blink rates. These findings suggest a
   possible role for striatal dopamine activity in the process by which
   reward-related information shapes the way people see themselves as
   agents.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{113-125}},
Abstract = {{It has been suggested that differential use of configural processing
   strategies may underlie racially based recognition deficits (known as
   the ``other-race effect{''}). By employing a well-known configural
   manipulation (Thatcherization, i.e., rotating the eyes and mouth by 180
   degrees), we aimed to demonstrate, electrophysiologically, that
   configural processing is used to a greater extent when viewing same-race
   faces than when viewing other-race faces. Face-related event-related
   potential (ERP) responses were measured for participants viewing normal
   and Thatcherized faces of their own race (Caucasian) and of another race
   (African-American). The P1 and N170 components were modulated to a
   greater extent by Thatcherization for same-race faces, suggesting that
   the processing of these faces is, in fact, more reliant on configural
   information than other-race faces. Thatcherization also affected the
   P250 component more so for same-race faces independently of orientation.
   The race-dependent effects of Thatcherization as early as P1 suggest
   that configural encoding may be occurring much earlier than the
   well-cited N170.}},

Title = {{Medial prefrontal cortex supports source memory accuracy for
   self-referenced items}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{126-145}},
Abstract = {{Previous behavioral work suggests that processing information in
   relation to the self enhances subsequent item recognition. Neuroimaging
   evidence further suggests that regions along the cortical midline,
   particularly those of the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), underlie this
   benefit. There has been little work to date, however, on the effects of
   self-referential encoding on source memory accuracy or whether the
   medial PFC might contribute to source memory for self-referenced
   materials. In the current study, we used fMRI to measure neural activity
   while participants studied and subsequently retrieved pictures of common
   objects superimposed on one of two background scenes (sources) under
   either self-reference or self-external encoding instructions. Both item
   recognition and source recognition were better for objects encoded
   self-referentially than self-externally. Neural activity predictive of
   source accuracy was observed in the medial PFC (Brodmann area 10) at the
   time of study for self-referentially but not self-externally encoded
   objects. The results of this experiment suggest that processing
   information in relation to the self leads to a mnemonic benefit for
   source level features, and that activity in the medial PFC contributes
   to this source memory benefit. This evidence expands the purported role
   that the medial PFC plays in self-referencing.}},

Title = {{From simulation to reciprocity: The case of complementary actions}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{146-158}},
Abstract = {{A large body of research reports that perceiving body movements of other
   people activates motor representations in the observer's brain. This
   automatic resonance mechanism appears to be imitative in nature.
   However, action observation does not inevitably lead to symmetrical
   motor facilitation: Mirroring the observed movement might be
   disadvantageous for successfully performing joint actions. What remains
   unknown is how we are to resolve the possible conflict between the
   automatic tendency to ``mirror{''} and the need to perform different
   context-related complementary actions. By using single-pulse
   transcranial magnetic stimulation, we found that observation of a
   double-step action characterized by an implicit complementary request
   engendered a shift from symmetrical simulation to reciprocity in the
   participants' corticospinal activity. Accordingly, differential motor
   facilitation was revealed for the snapshots evoking imitative and
   complementary gestures despite the fact that the observed type of grasp
   was identical. Control conditions in which participants observed the
   same action sequence but in a context not implying a complementary
   request were included as well. The results provide compelling evidence
   that when an observed action calls for a nonidentical complementary
   action, an interplay between the automatic tendency to resonate with
   what is observed and to implicitly prepare for the complementary action
   does emerge. In other words, implicit complementary requests might have
   the ability to draw attention to specific features of the context
   affording nonidentical responses.}},

Title = {{Mental attributes and temporal brain dynamics during bargaining: EEG
   source localization and neuroinformatic mapping}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{159-177}},
Abstract = {{It was previously shown by fMRI studies that unfair offers during an
   ultimatum bargaining game activate regions in the brain associated with
   emotions and conflict, leading to decisions inconsistent with standard
   economic theory. The temporal dynamics of emotional processing and
   mental attributes were not clear due to the coarse temporal resolution
   in those studies (similar to 2 s). Here, the ultimatum game was studied
   by EEG recorded from the responders in 19 channels. EEG time series were
   first in-put to independent component analysis. An equivalent current
   dipole model was used to localize the sources of the independent
   components in EEGLAB. The Talairach coordinates of the dipoles were
   matched with references in the Brede neuroinformatics database. Dipole
   magnitudes, anatomical regions, and mental attributes were used to
   explain the rejection of the offers by applying multiple regression as a
   function of time in epochs with a median resolution of 250 ms. The
   results are consistent with previous studies regarding responder
   behavior and activated regions (e.g., anterior cingulate cortex, frontal
   gyrus, insular cortex). There are three main findings observed with the
   higher temporal resolution: (1) regression results from fine-scale
   temporal data showed activations not captured when the analysis was done
   by using time-averaged data; (2) temporal analysis detected the
   individual significant epochs and fluctuations (positive and negative
   correlations) in regions and for the associated mental attributes (e.g.,
   reward/harm perception, anger, unfairness); (3) there was a sequential
   activation of anterior cingulate cortex and insular cortex,
   respectively, leading to the rejection response. Overall, regression
   models could explain a large percentage (similar to 80\%) of
   out-of-sample behavioral responses. The results are promising for the
   prospect of using EEG and source localization techniques in
   neuroeconomics to study finer temporal dynamics of neural activation.}},

Title = {{Risky decision-making in older adults without cognitive deficits: An
   fMRI study of VMPFC using the Iowa Gambling Task}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{178-190}},
Abstract = {{Some older adults without neurological disease exhibit impaired
   decision-making in risky, nontransparent situations, like the Iowa
   Gambling Task (IGT). The prefrontal cortices are particularly vulnerable
   to age-related decline, and numerous studies implicate the ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) in successful IGT performance. However, the
   relationship between IGT performance and VMPFC function in older adults
   has not yet been tested by fMRI. In the present study, older adults with
   seemingly no cognitive impairments performed the IGT and a non-gambling
   control task during fMRI. Group analyses indicate that in these older
   adults, regardless of IGT performance level, a right VMPFC subregion is
   activated during the IGT, while successful IGT performance is correlated
   with left VMPFC activation, suggesting that bilateral VMPFC during
   risky, nontransparent situations may contribute to successful
   decision-making in older adults. Individual subject analyses reveal
   substantial variation regarding the extent and location of VMPFC
   activation during the IGT, a finding not captured in the group analysis:
   There is no correlation between IGT performance and extent of activation
   in the right VMPFC, although there is such a correlation between left
   VMPFC activation and IGT performance.}},

Title = {{The empathic, physiological resonance of stress}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{191-201}},
Abstract = {{Physiological resonance between individuals is considered fundamental to
   the biological capacity for empathy. Observers of pain and distress
   commonly exhibit increases in reported distress, autonomic arousal,
   facial mimicry, and overlapping neural activity. An important, unstudied
   question is whether physiological stress can also resonate.
   Physiological stress is operationalized as activation of the
   hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) and sympatho-adrenomedullary
   (SAM) axes. People often report an aversive state resulting from the
   stress of another, but this could be conveyed through resonating arousal
   or distress, without activating the physiological stress response.
   Physiological stress is particularly important to examine since it
   commonly occurs chronically, with known negative effects on health.
   Salivary cortisol and salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) were measured in both
   speakers and observers during a modified Trier Social Stress Test (TSST)
   to assess activation of the HPA and SAM axes (respectively). Cortisol
   (but not sAA) responses resonated between speakers and observers. The
   cortisol response of observers increased with trait empathy and was not
   related to the speaker's subjective fear or distress. This study
   provides a novel method for examining physiological resonance, and
   indicates that we can indeed catch another's physiological stress,
   suggesting a specific health risk for those in the social network of
   stressed individuals.}},

   addition, at encoding, eye movements and pupillary responses to Asian
   faces (i.e., the other race) were different from those to Caucasian
   faces (i.e., the own race). Processing of own-race faces was
   characterized by more active scanning, with a larger number of shorter

Abstract = {{The ability to use cognitive reappraisal to regulate emotions is an
   adaptive skill in adulthood, but little is known about its development.
   Because reappraisal is thought to be supported by linearly developing
   prefrontal regions, one prediction is that reappraisal ability develops
   linearly. However, recent investigations into socio-emotional
   development suggest that there are non-linear patterns that uniquely
   affect adolescents. We compared older children (10-13), adolescents
   (14-17) and young adults (18-22) on a task that distinguishes negative
   emotional reactivity from reappraisal ability. Behaviorally, we observed
   no age differences in self-reported emotional reactivity, but linear and
   quadratic relationships between reappraisal ability and age. Neurally,
   we observed linear age-related increases in activation in the left
   ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, previously identified in adult
   reappraisal. We observed a quadratic pattern of activation with age in
   regions associated with social cognitive processes like mental state
   attribution (medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex,
   anterior temporal cortex). In these regions, we observed relatively
   lower reactivity-related activation in adolescents, but higher
   reappraisal-related activation. This suggests that (i) engagement of the
   cognitive control components of reappraisal increases linearly with age
   and (ii) adolescents may not normally recruit regions associated with
   mental state attribution, but (iii) this can be reversed with
   reappraisal instructions.}},

   prefrontal cortex. In contrast, exposure to positive behavior across own
   and an unfamiliar mother (controlling for neutral behavior) was
   associated with superior temporal sulcus, occipital pole, amygdala and
   striatum activity. Adolescent depressive symptoms were associated with
   reduced rostral anterior cingulate activity during exposure to one's own
   (compared to an unfamiliar) mother's positive behavior, and reduced
   striatal activity during exposure to positive behavior in general. This
   study represents an important step in furthering our understanding of
   the neural basis of affective processing in adolescents. Further, the
   results support a disruption of reward function in depression.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescence is marked by profound psychosocial and physiological
   changes. Although investigations into the interactions between these
   forces have begun to shed light on the neural correlates of affective
   processing during the transition to adolescence, relatively little is
   known about the relationship between pubertal development and emotion
   perception at the neural level. In the current longitudinal study, 45
   neurotypical participants were shown affective facial displays while
   undergoing fMRI, at ages 10 and 13. Neural responses to emotional
   expressions at both time points were then correlated with a self-report
   measure of pubertal development, revealing positive associations with
   activity in amygdala, thalamus and visual cortical areas at age 10 that
   increased in magnitude and extent by age 13. At the latter time point,
   pubertal development was additionally correlated with enhanced responses
   to faces in temporal pole, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and
   dorsomedial PFC. Longitudinal comparisons revealed that the
   relationships between pubertal development and activity in the amygdala,
   hippocampus and temporal pole were significantly stronger during early
   adolescence than late childhood. These results suggest that pubertal
   development per se is linked to neural processing of socioemotional
   stimuli, particularly with respect to the integration of complex
   perceptual input and higher order cortical processing of affective
   content.}},

Abstract = {{The eyes provide important information for decoding the mental states of
   others. In this fMRI study we examined how reading the mind in the eyes
   develops across adolescence and we tested the developmental trajectories
   of brain regions involved in this basic perceptual mind-reading ability.
   Participants from three age groups (early adolescents, mid adolescents
   and young adults) participated in the study and performed an adapted
   version of the `Reading the Mind in the Eyes task', in which photographs
   of the eye region of faces were presented. Behavioral results show that
   the ability to decode the feelings and thoughts of others from the eyes
   develops before early adolescence. For all ages, brain activity was
   found in the posterior superior temporal sulcus during reading the mind
   in the eyes relative to a control condition requiring age and gender
   judgments using the same eyes stimuli. Only early adolescents showed
   additional involvement of the medial prefrontal cortex, the inferior
   frontal gyrus and the temporal pole. The results are discussed in the
   light of recent findings on the development of the social brain network.}},

Abstract = {{Theory of Mind (ToM) is the ability to attribute thoughts, intentions
   and beliefs to others. This involves component processes, including
   cognitive perspective taking (cognitive ToM) and understanding emotions
   (affective ToM). This study assessed the distinction and overlap of
   neural processes involved in these respective components, and also
   investigated their development between adolescence and adulthood. While
   data suggest that ToM develops between adolescence and adulthood, these
   populations have not been compared on cognitive and affective ToM
   domains. Using fMRI with 15 adolescent (aged 11-16 years) and 15 adult
   (aged 24-40 years) males, we assessed neural responses during cartoon
   vignettes requiring cognitive ToM, affective ToM or physical causality
   comprehension (control). An additional aim was to explore relationships
   between fMRI data and self-reported empathy. Both cognitive and
   affective ToM conditions were associated with neural responses in the
   classic ToM network across both groups, although only affective ToM
   recruited medial/ventromedial PFC (mPFC/vmPFC). Adolescents additionally
   activated vmPFC more than did adults during affective ToM. The
   specificity of the mPFC/vmPFC response during affective ToM supports
   evidence from lesion studies suggesting that vmPFC may integrate
   affective information during ToM. Furthermore, the differential neural
   response in vmPFC between adult and adolescent groups indicates
   developmental changes in affective ToM processing.}},

Abstract = {{Peer feedback affects adolescents' behaviors, cognitions and emotions.
   We examined neural circuitry underlying adolescents' emotional response
   to peer feedback using a functional neuroimaging paradigm whereby, 36
   adolescents (aged 9-17 years) believed they would interact with unknown
   peers postscan. Neural activity was expected to vary based on
   adolescents' perceptions of peers and feedback type. Ventrolateral
   prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) activity was found when adolescents indicated
   how they felt following feedback (acceptance or rejection) from peers of
   low vs high interest. Greater activation in both cortical (e.g. superior
   temporal gyrus, insula, anterior cingulate) and subcortical (e.g.
   striatum, thalamus) regions emerged in response to acceptance vs
   rejection feedback. Response to acceptance also varied by age and gender
   in similar regions (e.g. superior temporal gyrus, fusiform, insula),
   with greater age-related increases in activation to acceptance vs
   rejection for females than males. Affective response to rejection vs
   acceptance did not yield significantly greater neural activity in any
   region. vlPFC response suggests cognitive flexibility in reappraising
   initial perceptions of peers following feedback. Striatal response
   suggests that acceptance is a potent social reward for adolescents, an
   interpretation supported by more positive self-reported affective
   response to acceptance than rejection from high- but not low-interest
   peers.}},

Abstract = {{We developed an ecologically valid virtual peer interaction paradigm-the
   Chatroom Interact Task in which 60 pre-adolescents and adolescents (ages
   9-17 years) were led to believe that they were interacting with other
   youth in a simulated internet chatroom. Youth received rejection and
   acceptance feedback from virtual peers. Findings revealed increased
   pupil dilation, an index of increased activity in cognitive and
   affective processing regions of the brain, to rejection compared to
   acceptance trials, which was greater for older youth. Data from a
   cell-phone Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) protocol completed
   following the task indicated that increased pupillary reactivity to
   rejection trials was associated with lower feelings of social
   connectedness with peers in daily life. Eyetracking analyses revealed
   attentional biases toward acceptance feedback and away from rejection
   feedback. Biases toward acceptance feedback were stronger for older
   youth. Avoidance of rejection feedback was strongest among youth with
   increased pupillary reactivity to rejection, even in the seconds leading
   up to and following rejection feedback. These findings suggest that
   adolescents are sensitive to rejection feedback and seek to anticipate
   and avoid attending to rejection stimuli. Furthermore, the salience of
   social rejection and acceptance feedback appears to increase during

Abstract = {{Involvement with friends carries many advantages for adolescents,
   including protection from the detrimental effects of being rejected by
   peers. However, little is known about the mechanisms through which
   friendships may serve their protective role at this age, or the
   potential benefit of these friendships as adolescents transition to
   adulthood. As such, this investigation tested whether friend involvement
   during adolescence related to less neural sensitivity to social threats
   during young adulthood. Twenty-one adolescents reported the amount of
   time they spent with friends outside of school using a daily diary. Two
   years later they underwent an fMRI scan, during which they were
   ostensibly excluded from an online ball-tossing game by two same-age
   peers. Findings from region of interest and whole brain analyses
   revealed that spending more time with friends during adolescence related
   to less activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and anterior
   insula-regions previously linked with negative affect and pain
   processing-during an experience of peer rejection 2 years later. These
   findings are consistent with the notion that positive relationships
   during adolescence may relate to individuals being less sensitive to
   negative social experiences later on.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescent risk taking has been known to increase in the presence of
   peers. We hypothesized that peer interaction reduces the activation of
   the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that is required for self-regulation
   of reward-driven behavior. We also expected that mPFC activity would be
   reduced more in those with greater surgency, a composite trait of
   behavioral approach, sensation seeking and positive affect. In our
   study, 20 15-year-old boys played a simulated driving video game alone
   and in the presence of peers who were encouraged to call out advice
   while we recorded the feedback-related negativity (FRN) event-related
   potential in response to an impending car crash. FRN amplitude was
   reduced both as a function of peer presence and increased surgency. More
   importantly, we also calculated intracerebral current source density at
   the time of the FRNs, and found that both greater surgency and peer
   presence are associated with reduced activity specifically in the mPFC.
   Riskier performance resulting in more car crashes resulted from the
   presence of peers only as an interaction with surgency, this interaction
   being related strongly to reduced activity in the ventromedial PFC.}},

Abstract = {{Normal aging causes a decline in object recognition. Importantly,
   lesions of the perirhinal cortex produce similar deficits and also lead
   to object discrimination impairments when the test objects share common
   features, suggesting that the perirhinal cortex participates in
   perceptual discrimination. The current experiments investigated the
   ability of young and aged animals to distinguish between objects that
   shared features with tasks with limited mnemonic demands. In the first
   experiment, young and old rats performed a variant of the spontaneous
   object recognition task in which there was a minimal delay between the
   sample and the test phase. When the test objects did not share any
   features ({''}Easy{''} perceptual discrimination) both young and aged
   rats correctly identified the novel object. When the test objects
   contained overlapping features, however, only the young rats showed an
   exploratory preference for the novel object. In Experiment 2, young and
   aged monkeys were tested on an object discrimination task. When the
   object pairs were dissimilar, both the young and aged monkeys learned to
   select the rewarded object quickly. In contrast, when LEGOs (R) were
   used to create object pairs with overlapping features, the aged monkeys
   took significantly longer than did the young animals to learn to
   discriminate between the rewarded and the unrewarded object. Together,
   these data indicate that behaviors requiring the perirhinal cortex are
   disrupted in advanced age, and suggest that at least some of these
   impairments may be explained by changes in high-level perceptual
   processing in advanced age.}},

Abstract = {{The amygdala has been implicated in affective and social processing for
   more than a century. Animals with damage to the amygdala have altered
   affective and social behavior patterns, though the precise nature of
   these behavioral changes depends on a number of factors including lesion
   technique, age of the subject at the time of lesion, rearing, and
   housing environments. Interpretations of amygdala lesion studies are
   further complicated by the potentially confounded nature of affective
   and social stimuli (e. g., social interactions with a conspecific
   partner that is consistently aggressive). In the present study, we
   evaluated affective responding to affectively and socially evocative
   video stimuli in a group of rhesus macaques that received bilateral
   amygdala lesions as neonates. The stimuli were produced to vary
   independently in terms of their affective and social content. The
   responses of the amygdala-lesioned animals were compared with a group of
   age-matched controls and a group of animals that had sustained bilateral
   hippocampus damage as neonates. As compared with control animals,
   amygdala-lesioned animals had blunted responding to both positive and
   negative stimuli, regardless of social content, but did differentiate
   between levels of social content. Taken together, these findings suggest
   that early amygdala damage permanently compromises affective processing
   while leaving intact the ability to distinguish between socially
   meaningful contexts.}},

Abstract = {{Neonatal hippocampal damage in rodents impairs medial prefrontal working
   memory functions. To examine whether similar impairment will follow the
   same damage in primates, adult monkeys with neonatal hippocampal lesions
   and sham-operated controls were trained on two working memory tasks. The
   session-unique delayed nonmatch-to-sample (SU-DNMS) task measures
   maintenance of information in working memory mediated by the ventral
   lateral prefrontal cortex. The object self-ordered (Obj-SO) task
   measures monitoring of information in working memory mediated by the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Adult monkeys with neonatal hippocampal
   lesions performed as well as sham-operated controls on the SU-DNMS task
   at either the 5- or 30-s delays but were severely impaired on the Obj-SO
   task. These results extend the earlier findings in rodents by
   demonstrating that early lesions of the hippocampus in monkeys impair
   working memory processes known to require the integrity of the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex while sparing lower order working memory
   processes such as recency. Although the present results suggest that the
   lack of functional hippocampal inputs may have altered the maturation of
   the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, future studies will be needed to
   determine whether the nature of the observed working memory deficit is
   due to an absence of the hippocampus, a maldevelopment of the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, or both.}},

Abstract = {{The FVB/N (FVB) mouse has been a popular background strain for
   constructing transgenic mice. However, behavioral phenotyping of the
   resultant mice is complicated, due to severe visual impairment in the
   FVB background strain. Previous studies reported cognitive impairments
   with the FVB strain, suggesting the background as unsuitable for
   behavioral analysis. In this study, we compared FVB mice to the
   well-characterized C57BL/6 (B6) strain in a battery of
   hippocampus-dependent tasks that had several nonvisual cues. The tasks
   included: trace eyeblink conditioning, spontaneous alternation in the Y
   maze, social recognition, trace and contextual fear conditioning, and
   odor habituation-dishabituation. FVB mice were able to learn all the
   tasks, often to similar levels as B6 mice. In contrast to previous
   reports, our data suggest FVB mice are not cognitively deficient with
   temporal memory tasks, when the tasks do not rely heavily upon vision.
   Thus, the FVB strain may be used as the genetic background for
   behavioral phenotyping when nonvisual hippocampal-dependent tasks are
   utilized.}},

   Medial Prefrontal Cortex-Dependent Behaviors in Mice}},

Abstract = {{In humans, stroke or trauma-induced damage to the orbitofrontal cortex
   (OFC) or medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) results in impaired cognitive
   flexibility. Alcoholics also exhibit similar deficits in cognitive
   flexibility, suggesting that the OFC and mPFC are susceptible to
   alcohol-induced dysfunction. The present experiments investigated this
   issue using an attention set-shifting assay in ethanol dependent adult
   male C57BL/6J mice. Ethanol dependence was induced by exposing mice to
   repeated cycles of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor inhalation.
   Behavioral testing was conducted 72 hours or 10 days following CIE
   exposure to determine whether ethanol-induced changes in OFC-dependent
   (reversal learning) and mPFC-dependent (set-shifting) behaviors are long
   lasting. During early ethanol abstinence (72 hrs), CIE mice showed
   reduced reversal learning performance as compared to controls. Reversal
   learning deficits were revealed as greater number of trials to
   criterion, more errors made, and a greater difficulty in performing a
   reversal learning task relative to baseline performance. Furthermore,
   the magnitude of the impairment was greater during reversal of a simple
   discrimination rather than reversal of an intra-dimensional shift.
   Reversal learning deficits were no longer present when mice were tested
   10 days after CIE exposure, suggesting that ethanol-induced changes in
   OFC function can recover. Unexpectedly, performance on the set-shifting
   task was not impaired during abstinence from ethanol. These data suggest
   reversal learning, but not attention set-shifting, is transiently
   disrupted during short-term abstinence from CIE. Given that reversal
   learning requires an intact OFC, these findings support the idea that
   the OFC may be vulnerable to the cognitive impairing actions of ethanol.}},

Abstract = {{A good deal is known about psychological factors that contribute to
   reward value, but very little is known about how reward is computed in
   the brain. Integration in the circuit for brain stimulation reward may
   provide a simple model system. Parametric studies have favored the idea
   that the integration is linear, although a few have suggested that it
   involves adaptation. However, these studies have generally not focused
   on relevance to psychological factors such as temporal discounting of
   reward. To begin to address these issues, I gave rats a choice between a
   simple train of 2 seconds of stimulation at a uniform frequency and a
   compound train of 1 second of stimulation at either 50, 150, or 250 Hz
   immediately followed by 1 second of stimulation at 50, 150, or 250 Hz,
   for a total of nine compound trains. For each compound train, the
   frequency of the simple train was varied until a level was found that
   produced indifference. The order of the frequencies was important, with
   Hi-Lo compound stimulation having a higher matching frequency than the
   symmetrical Lo-Hi. Furthermore, there was an interaction between the
   first and second frequencies, with the second frequency counting less
   when the first frequency was high. The results could be fit by
   computational models incorporating the ideas of either (a) adaptation or
   (b) temporal discounting and a power function psychological scale. These
   results suggest that integration in the brain stimulation reward system
   is nonlinear, and involves either adaptation or temporal discounting of
   reward value.}},

Abstract = {{We know much about how rats use their whiskers to discriminate simple
   tactile properties, but little about how they are used in natural
   settings. Here we studied whisker motion during social interactions
   between rats in order to gain a better understanding of natural whisker
   use in this model system for sensorimotor integration. In the first set
   of experiments, an intruder was placed in a second rat's home cage.
   Anogenital sniffing immediately ensued; later in the trial, facial
   interactions occurred at least as frequently. Whereas much previous work
   has focused on the importance of anogenital sniffing during social
   interactions, these facial interactions were accompanied by some of the
   most intense whisker behaviors described to date. Whisker trimming
   increased biting but reduced boxing. In addition, whiskers were more
   protracted and whisking amplitude was larger in aggressive than in
   nonaggressive interactions. In a second set of experiments, rats
   interacted facially across a gap. As rats approached each other,
   whisking amplitude decreased and whiskers were more protracted. Whisker
   trimming disrupted facial alignment and reduced the frequency of
   interactions, indicating that whisker use, and possibly whisker
   protraction, is important for rats to orient themselves with respect to
   one another. We also found that females whisked with smaller amplitude
   when interacting with males than with females, and that they held their
   whiskers less protracted than males. The natural whisker use described
   here should further our understanding of this important somatosensory
   system during social interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Syrian hamsters readily form dominant-subordinate relationships under
   laboratory conditions. Winning or losing in agonistic encounters can
   have striking, long-term effects on social behavior, but the mechanisms
   underlying this experience-induced behavioral plasticity are unclear.
   The present study tested the hypothesis that changes in brain-derived
   neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may at least in part mediate this plasticity.
   Male hamsters were paired for 15-min using a resident-intruder model,
   and individuals were identified as winners or losers on the basis of
   their behavior. BDNF was examined with in situ hybridization 2 hr after
   treatment during the consolidation period of emotional learning. Losing
   animals had significantly more BDNF mRNA in the basolateral (BLA) and
   medial (MeA) nuclei of the amygdala when compared with winning animals
   as well as novel cage and home cage controls. Interestingly, winning
   animals had significantly more BDNF mRNA in the dentate gyrus of the
   dorsal hippocampus than did losing animals, novel, and home cage
   controls. No conflict-related changes in BDNF mRNA were observed in
   several other regions including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis
   and central amygdala. Next, we demonstrated that K252a, a Trk receptor
   antagonist, significantly reduced the acquisition of conditioned defeat
   when administered within the BLA. These data support a model in which
   BDNF-mediated plasticity within the BLA supports learning of submission
   or subordinate social status in losing animals, whereas BDNF-mediated
   plasticity within the hippocampus may instantiate aspects of winning
   such as control of a territory in dominant animals.}},

Abstract = {{Vision is an ancient sense essential for various aspects of animal
   behavior. Visual information not only leads to immediate, temporary, and
   rapid behavioral responses but also has lasting effects. Naive
   behavioral responses to light are not always identical but can be
   altered based on positive or negative experience-a process defined as
   visual learning. In this study, Drosophila larvae were used as a simple
   model to study visual classical conditioning. We show that larvae are
   able to associate positive or negative cues with either light or
   darkness, thus changing their native light-preference. This effect can
   be robustly provoked through gustatory stimuli and electric shock. We
   further show that light can not only be used as a conditioned stimulus
   but also as an unconditioned stimulus, as punishment in the olfactory
   classical conditioning procedure, possibly forming two different kinds
   of memories. Our findings show that even though larvae show a strong
   naive response when exposed to light, the animals display a comparably
   large repertoire of visual memories that can be formed. Therefore, our
   study provides an impacting entry point into the genetic dissection of
   the neuronal circuit that underlies different types of visual learning.}},

Title = {{A History of Bingeing on Fat Enhances Cocaine Seeking and Taking}},

Abstract = {{Binge eating and substance dependence are disorders characterized by a
   loss of control over consummatory behaviors. Given the common
   characteristics of these two types of disorders, it is not surprising
   that the comorbidity between eating disorders and substance abuse
   disorders is high (20-40\%; Conason et al., 2006). It is unknown,
   however, whether loss of control in one disorder predisposes an
   individual to loss of control in the other. The present study,
   therefore, used a rodent model to test whether a history of binge eating
   would augment subsequent responding for cocaine. Using the limited
   access protocol described by Corwin et al. (1998), 45 adult male
   Sprague-Dawley rats were maintained on one of four dietary protocols for
   a period of six weeks: chow only (Chow; n = 9), continuous access to an
   optional source of dietary fat (Ad Lib; n = 12), 1-h access to an
   optional source of dietary fat daily (Daily; n = 12), or 1-h access to
   an optional source of dietary fat on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday (MWF;
   n = 12). All four groups also had unrestricted access to a nutritionally
   complete diet of chow and water. Fat-bingeing behaviors developed in the
   MWF rats, the group with the most restricted access to the optional fat.
   Thereafter, cocaine-seeking and -taking behaviors were assessed in all
   rats using a self-administration protocol modified from that described
   by Deroche-Gamonet et al. (2004), which focused on the motivation for
   and preoccupation with obtaining and consuming drug (assessed using a
   progressive ratio {[}PR] schedule of reinforcement) and persistence in
   responding for drug during periods of signaled drug non-availability
   (SNA). Rats with the MWF history tended to take more cocaine late in
   fixed ratio (FR) training, they persisted in their efforts to obtain
   cocaine in the face of signaled non-availability, worked harder for
   cocaine on a PR schedule of reinforcement, and exhibited more
   goal-directed behavior toward the cocaine-associated operandum. These
   results demonstrate a link between binge-type intake of fat and the
   development of drug-seeking and -taking behaviors, suggesting that a
   history of fat bingeing may predispose individuals to exhibit more
   robust ``addiction-like{''} behaviors toward a substance of abuse. Thus,
   it appears that conditions promoting excessive behavior toward one
   substance (e. g., a palatable fatty food) beget excessive behavior
   toward another (e. g., cocaine).}},

Abstract = {{Regulation of energy intake depends in part on both memory for prior
   food intake and internal signals of hunger and satiety. These functions
   are both mediated by the hippocampus, a brain structure that animal
   studies have shown to be impaired after maintenance on high fat and
   refined sugar (HFS) diets. Study 1, using a cross-sectional design,
   revealed that self-reported HFS diet was associated with poorer
   performance on hippocampal sensitive memory tasks but not other
   neuropsychological control measures. Study 2 replicated this finding in
   two groups selected to differ in HFS intake, additionally showing that
   this effect is specific to hippocampal functioning and does not extend
   to measures of prefrontal cortex function. Furthermore, in a
   laboratory-based test of food intake, the HFS rich diet groups were less
   accurate in recalling what they had previously eaten and evidenced
   reduced sensitivity to internal signals of hunger and satiety, relative
   to a group consuming less HFS rich diets. Together, these findings
   reveal an association between HFS consumption and poorer hippocampal
   function in human participants, consistent with findings from
   animal-based studies. Moreover, our results suggest that this may be
   related to impaired regulation of energy intake via less accurate
   tracking of prior food intake and reduced sensitivity to hunger and
   satiety signals.}},

Abstract = {{During ingestion of water, chocolate, sucrose, and saccharin,
   pain-related behaviors are suppressed. This ingestion analgesic effect
   is reversed when the hedonic valence of a food is switched from
   ``good{''} to ``bad{''} as occurs during conditioned taste aversion.
   Here, we tested the converse hedonic shift to determine if ingestion
   analgesia occurs when 0.3 M NaCl is made palatable by inducing a sodium
   appetite. In Experiment 1, sham- and sodium-depleted rats were tested
   for paw withdrawal and lick latencies to brief noxious heat during quiet
   wake and intraoral NaCl ingestion. Only sodium-depleted rats showed a
   suppression of heat-evoked reactions during NaCl ingestion. In
   Experiment 2, we tested whether this analgesic effect is mediated by the
   brainstem nucleus raphe magnus (NRM). Inactivation of NRM with muscimol
   blocked ingestion analgesia during NaCl ingestion by sodium-depleted
   rats. This attenuation was not due to a hyperalgesic effect of NRM
   inactivation. Muscimol microinjections into a nearby region, the nucleus
   raphe obscurus (NRO), were ineffective. The present findings demonstrate
   that the internal milieu of an animal can modify ingestion analgesia,
   and that the analgesia during NaCl ingestion by sodium hungry rats is
   mediated by NRM.}},

Abstract = {{Fragile X syndrome (FXS; MIM \#300624), a well-recognized form of
   inherited human mental retardation is caused, in most cases, by a CGG
   trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5'-untranslated region of FMR1,
   resulting in reduced expression of the fragile X mental retardation
   protein (FMRP). Clinical features include macroorchidism, anxiety,
   mental retardation, motor coordination, and speech articulation
   deficits. The Fmr1 knockout (Fmr1-KO) mouse, a mouse model for FXS, has
   been shown to replicate the macroorchidism, cognitive deficits, and
   neuroanatomical abnormalities found in human FXS. Here we asked whether
   Fmr1-KO mice also display appendicular and oromotor deficits comparable
   to the ataxia and dysarthric speech seen in FXS patients. We employed
   standard motor tests for balance and appendicular motor coordination,
   and used a novel long-term fluid-licking assay to investigate oromotor
   function in Fmr1-KO mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates. Fmr1-KO
   mice performed equally well as their WT littermates on standard motor
   tests, with the exception of a raised-beam task. However, Fmr1-KO mice
   had a significantly slower licking rhythm than their WT littermates.
   Deficits in rhythmic fluid-licking in Fmr1-KO mice have been linked to
   cerebellar pathologies. It is believed that balance and motor
   coordination deficits in FXS patients are caused by cerebellar
   neurophathologies. The neuronal bases of speech articulation deficits in
   FXS patients are currently unknown. It is yet to be established whether
   similar neuronal circuits control rhythmic fluid-licking pattern in mice
   and speech articulation movement in humans.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescence is a risky business. Despite outstanding physical health,
   the risk of injury or death during adolescence is 2-3 times that of
   childhood. The primary cause of this increase in morbidity and mortality
   is heightened risky behavior including drinking, driving, drug-taking,
   smoking, and unprotected sex. Why is it that some adolescents take big
   risks, while others do not? One potential source of individual
   differences in risk-taking behavior may lie in individual differences in
   executive function including judgment, impulse control, self-monitoring,
   and planning. Researchers have hypothesized that limited brain system
   integration and efficiency, particularly in the prefrontal cortex and
   related structures, may be involved in the range and degree of risky
   behavior commonly exhibited by teens. In the present study, we examined
   the relation between risky behavior, personality factors, and
   performance on neuropsychological tests of executive function. The
   community sample of 136 adolescents aged 13- to 17-years-old and 57
   emerging adults aged 18- to 22-years-old exhibited marked individual
   differences in risk-taking behavior; participants' scores on a alcohol,
   smoking, drugs, sex, driving, and antisocial behavior questionnaire
   ranged from 0 to near the maximum value possible. We found that risky
   personality and performance on the neuropsychological tests were both
   significant predictors of real-world risk-taking. These data have
   important implications for current public policies involving adolescents
   and emerging adults.}},

Abstract = {{A deficit in inhibition may underlie some of the symptoms of
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), particularly
   impulsivity. However, the data on inhibitory deficits in children with
   ADHD are mixed. Moreover, there has been little characterization of
   inhibitory processes in animal models of ADHD. Pavlov's conditioned
   inhibition procedure allows a direct assessment of the inhibitory status
   of a stimulus via summation and retardation tests. Therefore, in the
   current study, we examined conditioned inhibition in spontaneously
   hypertensive rats (SHRs), the most well-validated animal model of ADHD.
   SHRs and Wistar rats were trained in a simultaneous feature-negative
   discrimination in eyeblink conditioning. Each session consisted of a
   mixture of 2 trial types: a tone paired with a periocular stimulation
   (A+) or a tone and light presented simultaneously without a periocular
   stimulation (XA-). Both SHRs and Wistars were able to discriminate A+
   from XA-trials. In subsequent summation (X presented simultaneously with
   a different conditioned excitor, B) and retardation (X paired with the
   periocular stimulation) tests, the presence of inhibition to X was
   confirmed in both SHRs and Wistars: X reduced responding to B, and X was
   slow to develop excitation when paired with periocular stimulation.
   These results are the first to demonstrate Pavlovian conditioned
   inhibition in SHRs and to use summation and retardation tests to confirm
   X as a conditioned inhibitor. The data indicate that conditioned
   inhibition is intact in SHRs; thus, inhibitory processes that do not
   require prefrontal cortex or cerebellum may be normal in this strain.}},

Abstract = {{The anterior cinculate cortex (ACC) is known to be implicated in
   pain-fear and reward expectations. Animals were given electrolytic
   lesions of the ACC and then trained in the consummatory successive
   negative contrast (cSNC) situation. In cSNC, animals exposed to an
   incentive downshift from 32\% to 4\% sucrose exhibit less consummatory
   behavior than animals always exposed to 4\% sucrose. The ACC lesion had
   no measurable effects on the consummatory performance of animals before
   the downshift (i.e., the lesion did not affect consumption of 32\% vs.
   4\% sucrose); on the performance of unshifted, 4\% sucrose animals; and
   on the first downshift trial. However, ACC animals exhibited a
   significant retardation of recovery from cSNC relative to downshifted
   shams. Within-trial analysis of consummatory behavior indicated that ACC
   lesions facilitated cSNC during both the initial and last 100 s of
   postshift trials after the first downshift experience, relative to sham
   controls. These results suggest that the ACC is part of the neural
   circuit normally involved in coping with the emotional response induced
   by the incentive downshift event by inducing learning of the new
   incentive conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Estrous cycle disruption after spinal cord injury (SCI) in female rats
   is a common phenomenon. It remains unknown, however, if the aberrant
   estrous cycle is a result of an injury to the spinal cord itself or due
   to the general stress associated with surgical interventions. We
   addressed this issue by determining estrous cyclicality in female rats
   after a spinal cord hemisection (HX), implantation of EMG wires into
   selected hind limb muscles, and/or injections of tracer dyes into the
   spinal cord. Because it is known that aerobic exercise can enhance the
   recovery of locomotor function in rodents with an incomplete SCI, we
   also determined if locomotor training positively impacts the disrupted
   estrous cycle after an HX. Estrous cycle assessments were made during a
   5-8 week period in 27 female rats before and after HX, EMG, and/or dye
   injection surgeries and in HX rats that recovered spontaneously or
   underwent locomotor training. Our results show that estrous cyclicality
   was disrupted (cycle length >5 days) in approximately 76\%, 46\%, and
   50\% of the rats after HX, EMG, and dye injection surgeries,
   respectively. The cyclicality, however, was disrupted for a longer
   period after HX than after EMG or dye injection surgeries. Furthermore,
   estrous cycle mean length was shorter in the trained than nontrained HX
   group. These results suggest that estrous cycle disruption after a major
   SCI is a consequence of both the direct injury to the spinal cord and to
   the associated stress. Moreover, moderate aerobic exercise initiated
   early after a spinal cord HX returns the duration of the estrous cycle
   toward normal.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescents spend a significant part of their leisure time watching TV
   programs and movies that portray violence. It is unknown, however, how
   the extent of violent media use and the severity of aggression displayed
   affect adolescents' brain function. We investigated skin conductance
   responses, brain activation and functional brain connectivity to media
   violence in healthy adolescents. In an event-related functional magnetic
   resonance imaging experiment, subjects repeatedly viewed normed videos
   that displayed different degrees of aggressive behavior. We found a
   downward linear adaptation in skin conductance responses with increasing
   aggression and desensitization towards more aggressive videos. Our
   results further revealed adaptation in a fronto-parietal network
   including the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC), right precuneus
   and bilateral inferior parietal lobules, again showing downward linear
   adaptations and desensitization towards more aggressive videos. Granger
   causality mapping analyses revealed attenuation in the left lOFC,
   indicating that activation during viewing aggressive media is driven by
   input from parietal regions that decreased over time, for more
   aggressive videos. We conclude that aggressive media activates an
   emotion-attention network that has the capability to blunt emotional
   responses through reduced attention with repeated viewing of aggressive
   media contents, which may restrict the linking of the consequences of
   aggression with an emotional response, and therefore potentially
   promotes aggressive attitudes and behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been characterized by excessive
   default-network activation and connectivity with the subgenual
   cingulate. These hyper-connectivities are often interpreted as
   reflecting rumination, where MDDs perseverate on negative,
   self-referential thoughts. However, the relationship between
   connectivity and rumination has not been established. Furthermore,
   previous research has not examined how connectivity with the subgenual
   cingulate differs when individuals are engaged in a task or not. The
   purpose of the present study was to examine connectivity of the default
   network specifically in the subgenual cingulate both on- and off-task,
   and to examine the relationship between connectivity and rumination.
   Analyses using a seed-based connectivity approach revealed that MDDs
   show more neural functional connectivity between the posterior-cingulate
   cortex and the subgenual-cingulate cortex than healthy individuals
   during rest periods, but not during task engagement. Importantly, these
   rest-period connectivities correlated with behavioral measures of
   rumination and brooding, but not reflection.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effects of intranasal oxytocin (OXT) on trust and
   cooperation in borderline personality disorder (BPD), a disorder marked
   by interpersonal instability and difficulties with cooperation. Although
   studies in healthy adults show that intranasal OXT increases trust,
   individuals with BPD may show an altered response to exogenous OXT
   because the effects of OXT on trust and pro-social behavior may vary
   depending on the relationship representations and expectations people
   possess and/or altered OXT system functioning in BPD. BPD and control
   participants received intranasal OXT and played a social dilemma game
   with a partner. Results showed that OXT produced divergent effects in
   BPD participants, decreasing trust and the likelihood of cooperative
   responses. Additional analyses focusing on individual differences in
   attachment anxiety and avoidance across BPD and control participants
   indicate that these divergent effects were driven by the anxiously
   attached, rejection-sensitive participants. These data suggest that OXT
   does not uniformly facilitate trust and pro-social behavior in humans;
   indeed, OXT may impede trust and pro-social behavior depending on
   chronic interpersonal insecurities, and/or possible neurochemical
   differences in the OXT system. Although popularly dubbed the `hormone of
   love', these data suggest a more circumspect answer to the question of
   who will benefit from OXT.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with autism spectrum disorders have highly characteristic
   impairments in social interaction and this is true also for those with
   high functioning autism or Asperger syndrome (AS). These social
   cognitive impairments are far from global and it seems likely that some
   of the building blocks of social cognition are intact. In our first
   experiment, we investigated whether high functioning adults who also had
   a diagnosis of AS would be similar to control participants in terms of
   their eye movements when watching animated triangles in short movies
   that normally evoke mentalizing. They were. Our second experiment using
   the same movies, tested whether both groups would spontaneously adopt
   the visuo-spatial perspective of a triangle protagonist. They did. At
   the same time autistic participants differed in their verbal accounts of
   the story line underlying the movies, confirming their specific
   difficulties in on-line mentalizing. In spite of this difficulty, two
   basic building blocks of social cognition appear to be intact:
   spontaneous agency perception and spontaneous visual perspective taking.}},

Abstract = {{We explored the neural correlates of learning about people when the
   affective value of both facial appearance and behavioral information is
   manipulated. Participants were presented with faces that were either
   rated as high or low on trustworthiness. Subsequently, we paired these
   faces with positive, negative, or no behavioral information. Prior to
   forming face-behavior associations, a cluster in the right amygdala
   responded more strongly to untrustworthy than to trustworthy faces.
   During learning, a cluster in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC)
   responded more strongly to faces paired with behaviors than faces not
   paired with behaviors. We also observed that the activity in the dmPFC
   was correlated with behavioral learning performance assessed after
   scanning. Interestingly, individual differences in the initial amygdala
   response to face trustworthiness prior to learning modulated the
   relationship between dmPFC activity and learning. This finding suggests
   that the activity of the amygdala can affect the interaction between
   dmPFC activity and learning.}},

Abstract = {{Coping with stressful life events requires a degree of skill in the
   ability to attend to, comprehend, label, communicate and regulate
   emotions. Individuals vary in the extent to which these skills are
   developed, with the term `alexithymia' often applied in the clinical and
   personality literature to those individuals most compromised in these
   skills. Although a frontal lobe model of alexithymia is emerging, it is
   unclear whether such a model satisfactorily reflects brain-related
   patterns associated with perceived emotional intelligence at the facet
   level. To determine whether these trait meta-mood facets (ability to
   attend to, have clarity of and repair emotions) have unique gray matter
   volume correlates, a voxel-based morphometry study was conducted in 30
   healthy adults using the Trait Meta Mood Scale while co-varying for
   potentially confounding sociodemographic variables. Poorer Attention to
   Emotion was associated with lower gray matter volume in clusters
   distributed primarily throughout the frontal lobe, with peak correlation
   in the left medial frontal gyrus. Poorer Mood Repair was related to
   lower gray matter volume in three clusters in frontal and inferior
   parietal areas, with peak correlation in the left anterior cingulate. No
   significant volumetric correlations emerged for the Clarity of Emotion
   facet. We discuss the localization of these areas in the context of
   cortical circuits known to be involved in processes of self-reflection
   and cognitive control.}},

Abstract = {{Earlier research found evidence for electro-cortical race bias towards
   black target faces in white American participants irrespective of the
   task relevance of race. The present study investigated whether an
   implicit race bias generalizes across cultural contexts and racial in-
   and out-groups. An Australian sample of 56 Chinese and Caucasian males
   and females completed four oddball tasks that required sex judgements
   for pictures of male and female Chinese and Caucasian posers. The nature
   of the background (across task) and of the deviant stimuli (within task)
   was fully counterbalanced. Event-related potentials (ERPs) to deviant
   stimuli recorded from three midline sites were quantified in terms of
   mean amplitude for four components: N1, P2, N2 and a late positive
   complex (LPC; 350-700 ms). Deviants that differed from the backgrounds
   in sex or race elicited enhanced LPC activity. These differences were
   not modulated by participant race or sex. The current results replicate
   earlier reports of effects of poser race relative to background race on
   the LPC component of the ERP waveform. In addition, they indicate that
   an implicit race bias occurs regardless of participant's or poser's race
   and is not confined to a particular cultural context.}},

   the pSTS is specialized for reasoning about the actions of social agents

   inanimate entities. Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging,
   we investigated activation in response to passive viewing of successful
   and unsuccessful animate and inanimate goal-directed actions. Activation
   in the right pSTS was stronger in response to failed actions compared to
   successful actions, suggesting that the pSTS plays a role in encoding
   the goals underlying actions. Activation in the pSTS did not
   differentiate between animate and inanimate actions, suggesting that the
   pSTS is sensitive to the goal-directed actions of both animate and
   inanimate entities.}},

Abstract = {{The premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle is associated with marked
   changes in normal and abnormal motivated behaviors. Animal studies
   suggest that such effects may result from actions of gonadal hormones on
   the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system. We therefore investigated
   premenstrual changes in reward-related neural activity in terminal
   regions of the DA system in humans. Twenty-eight healthy young women
   underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging on 2 days during the
   menstrual cycle, once during the late follicular phase and once during
   the premenstrual phase, in counterbalanced order. Using a modified
   version of the monetary incentive delay task, we assessed responsiveness
   of the ventral striatum to reward anticipation. Our results show
   enhanced ventral striatal responses during the premenstrual as compared
   to the follicular phase. Moreover, this effect was most pronounced in
   women reporting more premenstrual symptoms. These findings provide
   support for the notion that changes in functioning of mesolimbic
   incentive processing circuits may underlie premenstrual changes in
   motivated behaviors. Notably, increases in reward-cue responsiveness
   have previously been associated with DA withdrawal states. Our findings
   therefore suggest that the sharp decline of gonadal hormone levels in
   the premenstrual phase may trigger a similar withdrawal-like state.}},

Abstract = {{Previous theories have proposed that the amygdala is hyper-responsive to
   novel stimuli in persons with an inhibited temperament-a biologically
   based predisposition to respond to novelty with wariness or avoidance
   behavior. In the current study, we used functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) to assess amygdala blood oxygenation level-dependent
   (BOLD) response when viewing novel or recently familiarized faces in
   persons with an extreme inhibited or uninhibited temperament. In persons
   with an inhibited temperament, the amygdala showed increased BOLD
   response when viewing both novel and recently familiarized faces. In
   contrast, in persons with an uninhibited temperament, BOLD response in
   the amygdala was increased only when viewing novel faces. These findings
   suggest that inhibited temperament is characterized not by a simple
   exaggerated response to novel faces, but rather by a sustained increase
   in amygdala response to faces even after the faces have become
   familiarized. In individuals with an inhibited temperament, this
   sustained response may be related to the wariness of social situations
   that persists beyond initial exposure.}},

Abstract = {{Two neurodevelopmental disorders, Williams syndrome (WS) and autism, are
   both commonly described as having opposite social profiles: social
   avoidance in autism vs hypersociability in individuals with WS. The goal
   of this study was to contrast the brain activity associated with
   language processing in these two populations, in order to understand the
   very likely interplay between the use of language and the sociability
   dimension, on which these disorders diverge. Towards this aim, the N400
   component of the event-related potentials was used to quantify the
   processing of semantic integration in these two populations. Results
   revealed that individuals with WS showed a significantly larger N400
   effect, as compared to both typical controls and individuals with
   autism, while the latter group demonstrated the smallest N400 effect.
   The findings demonstrate quite opposite profiles of neural correlates of
   language processing in WS and autism, mirroring their contrasting social
   phenotypes.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial attention has been argued to be adaptive by enhancing the
   processing of visual stimuli within the `spotlight of attention'. We
   previously reported that crude threat cues (backward masked fearful
   faces) facilitate spatial attention through a network of brain regions
   consisting of the amygdala, anterior cingulate and contralateral visual
   cortex. However, results from previous functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) dot-probe studies have been inconclusive regarding a
   fearful face-elicited contralateral modulation of visual targets. Here,
   we tested the hypothesis that the capture of spatial attention by crude
   threat cues would facilitate processing of subsequently presented visual
   stimuli within the masked fearful face-elicited `spotlight of attention'
   in the contralateral visual cortex. Participants performed a backward
   masked fearful face dot-probe task while brain activity was measured
   with fMRI. Masked fearful face left visual field trials enhanced
   activity for spatially congruent targets in the right superior occipital
   gyrus, fusiform gyrus and lateral occipital complex, while masked
   fearful face right visual field trials enhanced activity in the left
   middle occipital gyrus. These data indicate that crude threat elicited
   spatial attention enhances the processing of subsequent visual stimuli
   in contralateral occipital cortex, which may occur by lowering neural
   activation thresholds in this retinotopic location.}},

Abstract = {{Medial frontal scalp-recorded negativity occurring similar to 200-300 ms

   attenuated following unpredicted reward and potentiated following

   reflect dopaminergic `reward-prediction-error' signalling. We examined
   the influence of a putatively dopamine-based personality trait,
   extraversion (N = 30), and a dopamine-related gene polymorphism,
   DRD2/ANKK1 (N = 24), on FRN during an associative reward-learning
   paradigm. FRN was most negative following unpredicted non-reward and
   least-negative following unpredicted reward. A difference wave
   contrasting these conditions was significantly more pronounced for
   extraverted participants than for introverts, with a similar but
   non-significant trend for participants carrying at least one copy of the
   A1 allele of the DRD2/ANKK1 gene compared with those without the allele.
   Extraversion was also significantly higher in A1 allele carriers.
   Results have broad relevance to neuroscience and personality research

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Self-referential evaluation of emotional stimuli has been shown to
   modify the way emotional stimuli are processed. This study aimed at a
   new approach by investigating whether self-reference alters emotion
   processing in the absence of explicit self-referential appraisal
   instructions. Event-related potentials were measured while subjects
   spontaneously viewed a series of emotional and neutral nouns. Nouns were
   preceded either by personal pronouns ('my') indicating self-reference or
   a definite article ('the') without self-reference. The early posterior
   negativity, a brain potential reflecting rapid attention capture by
   emotional stimuli was enhanced for unpleasant and pleasant nouns
   relative to neutral nouns irrespective of whether nouns were preceded by
   personal pronouns or articles. Later brain potentials such as the late
   positive potential were enhanced for unpleasant nouns only when preceded
   by personal pronouns. Unpleasant nouns were better remembered than
   pleasant or neutral nouns when paired with a personal pronoun.
   Correlation analysis showed that this bias in favor of self-related
   unpleasant concepts can be explained by participants' depression scores.
   Our results demonstrate that self-reference acts as a first processing
   filter for emotional material to receive higher order processing after
   an initial rapid attention capture by emotional content has been
   completed. Mood-congruent processing may contribute to this effect.}},

Abstract = {{Findings from twin studies yield heritability estimates of 0.50 for
   prosocial behaviours like empathy, cooperativeness and altruism. First
   molecular genetic studies underline the influence of polymorphisms
   located on genes coding for the receptors of the neuropeptides, oxytocin
   and vasopressin. However, the proportion of variance explained by these
   gene loci is rather low indicating that additional genetic variants must
   be involved. Pharmacological studies show that the dopaminergic system
   interacts with oxytocin and vasopressin. The present experimental study
   tests a dopaminergic candidate polymorphism for altruistic behaviour,
   the functional COMT Val158Met SNP. N = 101 healthy Caucasian subjects
   participated in the study. Altruism was assessed by the amount of money
   donated to a poor child in a developing country, after having earned
   money by participating in two straining computer experiments. Construct
   validity of the experimental data was given: the highest correlation
   between the amount of donations and personality was observed for
   cooperativeness (r = 0.32, P 0.001). Carriers of at least one Val allele
   donated about twice as much money as compared with those participants

Abstract = {{Eyeblink conditioning abnormalities have been reported in schizophrenia,
   but the extent to which these anomalies are evident across a range of
   delay intervals (i.e., interstimulus intervals; ISIs) is unknown. In
   addition, the effects of ISI shifts on learning are unknown, though such
   manipulations can be informative about the plasticity of cerebellar
   timing functions. Therefore, the primary purpose of the present study
   was to investigate the interactions between ISI manipulations and
   learning in schizophrenia. A standard delay eyeblink conditioning
   procedure with four different interstimulus intervals (ISIs; 250, 350,
   550, 850 ms) was employed. Each eyeblink conditioning experiment was
   immediately followed by another with a different ISI, thus permitting
   the characterization of conditioned response (CR) learning at one ISI
   and the extent to which CRs could be generated at a different latency
   following an ISI shift. Collapsing across all conditions, the
   schizophrenia group (n = 55) had significantly fewer conditioned
   responses and longer onset latencies than age-matched controls (n = 55).
   Surprisingly, shifting to a new ISI had negligible effects on
   conditioned response rates in both groups. These findings contribute to
   evidence of robust eyeblink conditioning abnormalities in schizophrenia
   and suggest impaired cerebellar function, but underscore the need for
   more research to clarify the source of these abnormalities and their
   relationship to clinical manifestations of schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{The retrieval of a consolidated, apparently stable memory can return it
   to a labile state, necessitating another period of stabilization, termed
   reconsolidation. During reconsolidation, memories are susceptible to
   modifications, thus providing the opportunity to change unwanted
   memories. In a test of whether the possibility to alter retrieved
   memories depends on the age of the memories, participants learned a set
   of emotional and neutral pictures and recalled it 1, 7, or 28 days
   later. Immediately after retrieval, participants learned a second set of
   pictures. Memory retrieval per se enhanced 28-day-old memories but had
   no effect on 1-day-or 7-day-old memories. Learning new pictures
   interfered with 1-day-old and 28-day-old memories but not with 7-day-old
   memories. Evidence for reconsolidation effects was generally rather weak
   and at most present for 7-day-old memories. These findings show that
   retrieval and interference have opposite effects on memory that depend
   on the remoteness of the memories and raise the question under which
   conditions reconsolidation effects occur in human memory.}},

Abstract = {{Various lines of evidence suggest that disruptions in brain dopamine
   (DA) transmission produce behavioral impairments that can be overcome by
   salient response-eliciting environmental stimuli. We examined here
   whether D1 receptor blockade within striatal or frontal cortical DA
   target regions would differentially affect head entry responses elicited
   by an auditory cue compared with those occurring during noncued
   intertrial intervals. Rats received 2 drug-free 28-trial daily sessions
   in which an auditory cue was immediately followed by food delivery. On
   the following day, separate groups of rats received bilateral infusions
   of D1 antagonist SCH23390 to the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), nucleus
   accumbens (NAcc) core, or the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). SCH23390
   infused into the DMS and NAcc core suppressed noncued head entries but
   had no effect on head entries in response to the auditory cue. SCH23390
   infused to the mPFC did not reduce either cued or noncued approach
   responses. Systemic administration of the drug, in contrast, reduced the
   frequency of both cued and noncued approaches. The results are
   consistent with the notion that has emerged from the Parkinson's
   literature that reduced DA transmission produces behavioral suppression
   that can be overcome by salient environmental response elicitors, and
   extends this notion by showing that D1 receptor transmission within the
   striatum strongly suppresses noncued responses while leaving the
   identical behavior intact when cued by an environmental stimulus.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{125}},

Abstract = {{Accumulating evidence proposes that the striatum, known to control
   voluntary movement, may also play a role in learning and memory.
   Striatum learning is thought to require long-lasting reorganization of
   striatal circuits and changes in the strength of synaptic connections
   during the memorization of a complex motor task. Whether the ionotropic
   glutamate receptor N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDAR) contributes to the
   molecular mechanisms of these memory processes is still unclear. The aim
   of the present study was to investigate the role of striatal NMDAR and
   its subunit composition during the learning of the accelerating rotarod
   task in mice. To this end, we injected directly into the dorsal striatum
   of mice, via chronically implanted cannula, the NMDAR channel blocker
   MK-801 as well as the NR2A and NR2B subunit-selective antagonists
   NVP-AAM077 and Ro 25-6981, respectively, before rotarod training. There
   was no effect in the motor performances of mice treated with 1.0 mu
   g/side of MK-801, 0.1 mu g/side of NVP-AAM077, or 5 and 10 mu g/side of
   Ro 25-6981. In contrast, injections of 2.5 and 5 mu g/side of MK-801 or
   0.5 and 1 mu g/side of NVP-AAM077 impaired motor learning at Day 3 and
   8. Interestingly, treatments with MK-801 and NVP-AAM077 did not alter
   the general motor capacities of mice as revealed by the stepping, wire
   suspension, and pole tests. Our study demonstrates that the NMDAR of the
   dorsal striatum contributes to motor learning, especially during the
   slow acquisition phase, and that NR2A subunits play a critical role in
   this process.}},

Abstract = {{The glucocorticoid hormone cortisol has been shown to impair episodic
   memory performance. The present study examined the effect of two doses
   of hydrocortisone (synthetic cortisol) administration on
   autobiographical memory retrieval. Healthy volunteers (n = 66) were
   studied on two separate visits, during which they received placebo and
   either moderate-dose (0.15 mg/kg IV; n = 33) or high-dose (0.45 mg/kg
   IV; n = 33) hydrocortisone infusion. From 75 to 150 min post-infusion
   subjects performed an Autobiographical Memory Test and the California
   Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). The high-dose hydrocortisone administration
   reduced the percent of specific memories recalled (p =.04), increased
   the percent of categorical (nonspecific) memories recalled (p <.001),
   and slowed response times for categorical memories (p <.001), compared
   with placebo performance. Under moderate-dose hydrocortisone the
   autobiographical memory performance did not change significantly with
   respect to percent of specific or categorical memories recalled or
   reaction times. Performance on the CVLT was not affected by
   hydrocortisone. These findings suggest that cortisol affects
   accessibility of autobiographical memories in a dose-dependent manner.
   Specifically, administration of hydrocortisone at doses analogous to
   those achieved under severe psychosocial stress impaired the specificity
   and speed of retrieval of autobiographical memories.}},

Abstract = {{The current article examines the effect of administering
   dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) on visualspatial performance in
   postmenopausal women (N = 24, ages 55-80). The concurrent reduction of
   serum DHEA levels and visual-spatial performance in this population,
   coupled with the documented effects of DHEA's androgenic metabolites on
   visual-spatial performance, suggests that DHEA administration may
   enhance visual-spatial performance. The current experiment used a
   double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design in which 50 mg of oral
   DHEA was administered daily in the drug condition to explore this
   hypothesis. Performance on the Mental Rotation, Subject-Ordered
   Pointing, Fragmented Picture Identification, Perceptual Identification,
   Same-Different Judgment, and Visual Search tasks and serum levels of
   DHEA, DHEAS, testosterone, estrone, and cortisol were measured in the
   DHEA and placebo conditions. In contrast to prior experiments using the

Abstract = {{Adolescent exposure to anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) alters the
   development and activity of the glutamate neural system in the
   latero-anterior hypothalamus (LAH) in hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus);
   that is, an important neural component of the adolescent AAS-induced
   aggressive response. In this article, we used retrograde tracing to
   investigate glutamate-specific alterations in the connections between
   the LAH and several other nuclei implicated in adolescent AAS-induced
   aggression. Briefly, hamsters were treated with AAS or sesame-oil
   control during adolescence and then microinjected with retrograde tracer
   into the medial amygdala (MeA), lateral septum (LS), or bed nucleus of
   the stria terminalis (BNST). Brains were then processed for vesicular
   glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2) and examined for AAS-induced changes in
   the number VGLUT2 cells containing retrograde tracer (VGLUT2/tracer)
   within the LAH. It is interesting to note that while aggressive
   AAS-treated hamsters injected retrograde tracer into the MeA showed a
   significant reduction in the number of VGLUT2/tracer cells in the LAH,
   aggressive AAS-treated hamsters injected tracer into the BNST showed a
   significant increase in the number of VGLUT2/tracer cells in the LAH
   when compared with controls. Last, AAS hamsters injected with tracer
   into the LS had a comparable number of LAH-VGLUT2/tracer cells to
   controls. The current results indicate that glutamate likely functions
   as the major aggression output system from the LAH and that adolescent
   AAS treatment significantly alters the neural circuitry modulating
   aggression. Moreover, increases in the number of glutamate projections
   from the LAH to the BNST in AAS hamsters identify the BNST as an area
   particularly important for the regulation of AAS-induced aggression.}},

Abstract = {{The 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) is a valuable cognitive
   test that permits the simultaneous assessment of several different
   cognitive modalities, including attention, impulse control, processing
   speed, and cognitive flexibility. Increasing task difficulty on test
   days through various challenges can further enhance the versatility of
   this test by selectively enhancing the cognitive load on different
   aspects of the task. Systematic comparisons of the effects of different
   test day challenges on 5-CSRTT performance are essential to verify how
   these challenges affect different task measures and which manipulations
   are best suited for future studies of different aspects of cognition. We
   trained Wistar rats in the 5-CSRTT under standard conditions, then
   challenged them on the test days by (1) decreasing the duration of the
   stimulus to be detected, (2) increasing the time interval between trials
   (intertrial interval, ITI), (3) randomly varying the ITI, or (4) adding
   a flashing light distractor. All test day challenges produced distinct
   profiles of performance disruption that reflected differential effects
   on different cognitive modalities. Decreased stimulus duration
   selectively impaired attentional performance, while increased ITI
   increased impulsive-like premature responses and decreased trials
   completed. Variable ITI induced only mild, nonsignificant disruptions in
   response inhibition and processing speed, while the flashing light
   distractor produced comprehensive impairment affecting multiple aspects
   of 5-CSRTT performance, including disrupted attention and increased
   premature and timeout responses. This improved understanding of the
   effects of different test day challenges in the 5-CSRTT will allow
   researchers to use these manipulations of a valuable cognitive test to
   their full potential.}},

Abstract = {{A bias to allocate attention to the left hemispace, similar to the
   well-known pseudoneglect phenomenon shown by humans, has been recently
   reported in domestic chicks and other species of birds. Asymmetrical
   light exposure of the embryo of the domestic chick in a critical period
   before hatching is known to be responsible for a structural asymmetry in
   the visual ascending projections of the thalamofugal pathway and for
   lateralization of some visual behaviors. Thus the animal model provided
   by the chick makes possible investigation of the prenatal factors that
   may influence asymmetry in spatial attention. Here chicks coming from
   eggs exposed to light (light incubated, Li-chicks) and chicks incubated
   in darkness (dark incubated, Di-chicks) were tested in a task in which
   they were required to explore an area in front of them and to sample
   grains of food. The results showed that Li-chicks attended more to
   target stimuli located in the left hemispace, whereas no asymmetry was
   shown by Di-chicks. When grains of food were presented with small novel
   pebbles as distractors, both Li-and Di-chicks tended to allocate
   attention toward the left hemispace. When, however, chicks were tested
   after familiarization with pebbles, no bias was shown by either Li-and
   Di-chicks. Hence it seems that cerebral lateralization associated with
   right hemispheric involvement in response to novelty, interacts with the
   modulatory effect of asymmetric embryonic light stimulation on
   preferential allocation of spatial attention in the left hemispace
   (right hemisphere) and right eye (left hemisphere) control of visual
   discrimination during feeding.}},

Abstract = {{Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) are G protein-coupled
   receptors (M1-M5), grouped together into two functional classes, based
   on their G protein interaction. Although ubiquitously expressed in the
   CNS, the M4 protein shows highest expression in the neostriatum, cortex,
   and hippocampus. Electrophysiological and biochemical studies have
   provided evidence for overactive mAChR signaling in the fragile X
   knock-out (Fmr1KO) mouse model, and this has been hypothesized to
   contribute to the phenotypes seen in Fmr1KO mice. To address this
   hypothesis we used an M4 antagonist, tropicamide, to reduce the activity
   through the M4 mAChR and investigated the behavioral response in the
   Fmr1KO animals. Data from the marble-burying assay have shown that
   tropicamide treatment resulted in a decreased number of marbles buried
   in the wild-type (WT) and in the knockout (KO) animals. Results from the
   open field assay indicated that tropicamide increases activity in both
   the WT and KO mice. In the passive avoidance assay, tropicamide
   treatment resulted in the improvement of performance in both the WT and
   the KO animals at the lower doses (2 and 5 mg/kg), and the drug was
   shown to be important for the acquisition and not the consolidation
   process. Lastly, we observed that tropicamide causes a significant
   decrease in the percentage of audiogenic seizures in the Fmr1KO animals.
   These results suggest that pharmacological antagonism of the M4 receptor
   modulates select behavioral responses in the Fmr1KO mice.}},

Abstract = {{Mice and rats are often used interchangeably in neuroscience research.
   However, species differences in brain structure and connectivity exist
   within the medial temporal lobe circuits that contribute to learning and
   memory. The hippocampus in particular contributes to both spatial
   learning and recognition memory, but the extent to which rats and mice
   are comparable in these two cognitive domains remains unclear. To
   evaluate potential species differences in spatial memory and object
   recognition, young adult male Sprague-Dawley rats and male C57Bl/6J mice
   were tested in the water maze and novel object recognition tasks.
   Following six days of training, with four trials per day, there was no
   difference in the ability of rats and mice to learn the location of a
   hidden platform. However, rats performed better than mice on the probe
   trial, indicative of superior retention. In the novel object preference
   test, no species differences in recognition memory were detected,
   although rats spent more time exploring the arena and took longer to
   approach the objects. These observations suggest that while species
   differences in spatial memory retention are present, they do not
   correlate with differences in object recognition memory.}},

Abstract = {{Previous evidence suggests that `social gaze' can not only cause shifts
   in attention, but also can change the perception of objects located in
   the direction of gaze and how these objects will be manipulated by an
   observer. These findings implicate differences in the neural networks
   sub-serving action control driven by social cues as compared with
   nonsocial cues. Here, we sought to explore this hypothesis by using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging and a stimulus-response
   compatibility paradigm in which participants were asked to generate
   spatially congruent or incongruent motor responses to both social and
   nonsocial stimuli. Data analysis revealed recruitment of a dorsal
   frontoparietal network and the locus coeruleus for the generation of
   incongruent motor responses, areas previously implicated in controlling
   attention. As a correlate for the effect of `social gaze' on action
   control, an interaction effect was observed for incongruent responses to
   social stimuli in sub-cortical structures, anterior cingulate and
   inferior frontal cortex. Our results, therefore, suggest that performing
   actions in a-albeit minimal-social context significantly changes the
   neural underpinnings of action control and recruits brain regions
   previously implicated in action monitoring, the reorienting of attention
   and social cognition.}},

   perception of emotion. We borrowed a phenomenon from film theory which
   states that presentation of an as such neutral visual scene intensifies
   the percept of fear or suspense induced by a different channel of
   information, such as language. Our main aim was to investigate how
   neutral visual scenes can enhance responses to fearful language content
   in parts of the brain involved in the perception of emotion. Healthy
   participants' brain activity was measured (using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging) while they read fearful and less fearful sentences
   presented with or without a neutral visual scene. The main idea is that
   the visual scenes intensify the fearful content of the language by
   subtly implying and concretizing what is described in the sentence.
   Activation levels in the right anterior temporal pole were selectively
   increased when a neutral visual scene was paired with a fearful
   sentence, compared to reading the sentence alone, as well as to reading
   of non-fearful sentences presented with the same neutral scene. We
   conclude that the right anterior temporal pole serves a binding function
   of emotional information across domains such as visual and linguistic
   information.}},

Abstract = {{Social cues have subtle effects on a person, often without them being
   aware. One explanation for this influence involves implicit priming of
   trait associations. To study this effect, we activated implicit
   associations in participants of `being Clever' or `being Stupid' that
   were task relevant, and studied its behavioural impact on an independent
   cognitive task (the n-back task). Activating a representation of
   `Clever' caused participants to slow their reaction times after errors
   on the working memory task, while the reverse pattern was seen for
   associations to `Stupid'. Critically, these behavioural effects were
   absent in control conditions. Using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging, we show that the neural basis of this effect involves the
   anterior paracingulate cortex (area 32) where activity tracked the
   observed behavioural pattern, increasing its activity during error
   monitoring in the `Clever' condition and decreasing in the `Stupid'
   condition. The data provide a quantitative demonstration of how implicit
   cues, which specifically target a person's self-concept, influences the
   way we react to our own behaviour and point to the anterior
   paracingulate cortex as a critical cortical locus for mediating these
   self-concept related behavioural regulations.}},

Abstract = {{The neural bases of the association between negative affectivity and
   self-focus remain unknown in healthy subjects. Building on the role of
   the cortical midline structures (CMS) in self-referential processing, we
   hypothesized that negative affectivity in healthy subjects would be
   associated with an increased activation of the CMS during
   self-referential processing. We presented positive and negative pictures
   to 45 healthy subjects during fMRI and asked them to judge whether the
   pictures were related to themselves or not (self condition), or whether
   the pictures were positive or negative (general condition). Negative
   affectivity was measured by the level of harm avoidance (HA) with the
   Temperament and Character Inventory. Self-referential processing
   activated the CMS, including the dorsal and ventral medial prefrontal
   cortex (MPFC) and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). A higher HA
   score was associated with a greater activation of the dorsal MPFC and
   PCC during self-referential processing, this greater activation being
   more pronounced for negative pictures in the dorsal MPFC. This increased
   activation of the CMS may embody the association between negative
   affectivity and self-focus in healthy subjects, as previously observed
   in major depression. Within the CMS, the dorsal MPFC may play a key role
   in negative affectivity, integrating an increased attention to negative
   stimuli with an increased attention to the self.}},

Abstract = {{Emotional stimuli have been shown to preferentially engage initial
   attention but their sustained effects on neural processing remain
   largely unknown. The present study evaluated whether emotional faces
   engage sustained neural processing by examining the attenuation of
   neural repetition suppression to repeated emotional faces. Repetition
   suppression of neural function refers to the general reduction of neural
   activity when processing a repeated stimulus. Preferential processing of
   emotional face stimuli, however, should elicit sustained neural
   processing such that repetition suppression to repeated emotional faces
   is attenuated relative to faces with no emotional content. We measured
   the reduction of functional magnetic resonance imaging signals
   associated with immediate repetition of neutral, angry and happy faces.
   Whereas neutral faces elicited the greatest suppression in ventral
   visual cortex, followed by angry faces, repetition suppression was the
   most attenuated for happy faces. Indeed, happy faces showed almost no
   repetition suppression in part of the right-inferior occipital and
   fusiform gyri, which play an important role in face-identity processing.
   Our findings suggest that happy faces are associated with sustained
   visual encoding of face identity and thereby assist in the formation of
   more elaborate representations of the faces, congruent with findings in
   the behavioral literature.}},

Abstract = {{Self-face recognition is a sign of higher order self-awareness. Research
   into the neuronal network argues that the visual pathway of recognizing
   one's own face differs from recognizing others. The present study aimed
   at investigating the cortical network of self-other discrimination by
   producing virtual lesions over the temporo-parietal junction and the
   prefrontal cortex using low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic
   stimulation (rTMS) in a sham-controlled design. Frontal and parietal
   areas were stimulated separately in consecutive sessions one week apart
   in 10 healthy subjects. We designed a video-task comprising morphings of
   famous, unfamiliar and the subjects' own faces that transformed into
   each other over a time period of six seconds. Reaction time (RT) was
   measured by pushing a mouse-button once a change of identity was
   recognized. rTMS over the right temporo-parietal junction led to a
   decrease in RT when a subject's own face emerged from a familiar face; a
   similar effect was observed after rTMS over right-prefrontal and
   left-parietal cortices, when the subjects' ratings of own likeability
   were taken into account. The transition from an unfamiliar face to one's
   own face indicated a left frontal lateralization.}},

Abstract = {{Subjective experience suggests that negatively arousing memories are
   harder to control than neutral ones. Here, we investigate this issue in
   an item-cued directed forgetting experiment. Electroencephalogram
   event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded as participants viewed
   un-arousing neutral and highly arousing negative photographs, each
   followed by a cue to remember or forget it. Directed forgetting, that is
   reduced recognition of `to-be-forgotten' items, occurred for neutral but
   not negative pictures. ERPs revealed three underlying effects: first,
   during picture viewing a late parietal positive potential (LPP) was more
   pronounced for negative than for neutral pictures. Second, `remember'
   cues were associated with larger LPPs than `forget' cues. Third, an
   enhanced frontal positivity appeared for `forget' cues. This frontal
   positivity was generated in right dorso-lateral prefrontal regions
   following neutral pictures and in medial frontal cortex following
   negative pictures. LPP magnitude when viewing negative pictures was
   correlated with reduced directed forgetting, whereas both the enhanced
   frontal positivity for forget cues and the larger parietal positivity
   for remember cues predicted more directed forgetting. This study
   indicates that both processes of selective rehearsal (parietal
   positivities) and frontally controlled inhibition contribute to
   successful directed forgetting. However, due to their deeper incidental
   processing, highly arousing negative pictures are exempt from directed
   forgetting.}},

Abstract = {{People rationalize the choices they make when confronted with difficult
   decisions by claiming they never wanted the option they did not choose.
   Behavioral studies on cognitive dissonance provide evidence for
   decision-induced attitude change, but these studies cannot fully uncover
   the mechanisms driving the attitude change because only pre- and
   post-decision attitudes are measured, rather than the process of change
   itself. In the first fMRI study to examine the decision phase in a
   decision-based cognitive dissonance paradigm, we observed that increased
   activity in right-inferior frontal gyrus, medial fronto-parietal regions
   and ventral striatum, and decreased activity in anterior insula were
   associated with subsequent decision-related attitude change. These
   findings suggest the characteristic rationalization processes that are
   associated with decision-making may be engaged very quickly at the
   moment of the decision, without extended deliberation and may involve
   reappraisal-like emotion regulation processes.}},

Abstract = {{The implicit association test (IAT) has been widely used in social
   cognitive research over the past decade. Controversies have arisen over
   what cognitive processes are being tapped into using this task. While
   most models use behavioral (RT) results to support their claims, little
   research has examined neurocognitive correlates of these behavioral
   measures. The present study measured event-related brain potentials
   (ERPs) of participants while completing a gay-straight IAT in order to
   further understand the processes involved in a typical group bias IAT.
   Results indicated significantly smaller N400 amplitudes and
   significantly larger LPP amplitudes for compatible trials than for
   incompatible trials, suggesting that both the semantic and emotional
   congruence of stimuli paired together in an IAT trial contribute to the
   typical RT differences found, while no differences were present for
   earlier ERP components including the N2. These findings are discussed
   with respect to early and late processing in group bias IATs.}},

Abstract = {{To examine the time course and automaticity of our attention bias
   towards attractive opposite sex faces, event-related potentials (ERPs)
   were recorded from 20 males and 20 females while they carried out a
   covert orienting task. Faces that were high, low or average in
   attractiveness, were presented in focus of attention, but were unrelated
   to task goals. Across the entire sample larger P2 amplitudes were found
   in response to both attractive and unattractive opposite sex faces,
   presumably reflecting early implicit selective attention to distinctive
   faces. In male but not female participants this was followed by an
   increased late slow wave for the attractive faces, signifying heightened
   processing linked to motivated attention. This latter finding is
   consistent with sexual strategy theory, which suggests that men and
   women have evolved to pursue different mating strategies with men being
   more attentive to cues such as facial beauty. In general, our ERP
   results suggest that, in addition to threat-related stimuli, other
   evolutionary-relevant information is also prioritized by our attention

Abstract = {{Several recent studies have begun to examine the neurocognitive
   mechanisms involved in perceiving and responding to eye contact, a
   salient social signal of interest and readiness for interaction.
   Laboratory experiments measuring observers' responses to pictorial
   instead of live eye gaze cues may, however, only vaguely approximate the
   real-life affective significance of gaze direction cues. To take this
   into account, we measured event-related brain potentials and subjective
   affective responses in healthy adults while viewing live faces with a
   neutral expression through an electronic shutter and faces as pictures
   on a computer screen. Direct gaze elicited greater face-sensitive N170
   amplitudes and early posterior negativity potentials than averted gaze
   or closed eyes, but only in the live condition. The results show that
   early-stage processing of facial information is enhanced by another
   person's direct gaze when the person is faced live. We propose that
   seeing a live face with a direct gaze is processed more intensely than a
   face with averted gaze or closed eyes, as the direct gaze is capable of
   intensifying the feeling of being the target of the other's interest and
   intentions. These results may have implications for the use of pictorial
   stimuli in the social cognition studies.}},

Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{In an fMRI study, effects of contingency awareness on conditioned
   responses were assessed in three groups comprising 118 subjects. A
   differential fear-conditioning paradigm with visual conditioned stimuli,
   an electrical unconditioned stimulus and two distractors was applied.
   The instructed aware group was informed about the contingencies, whereas
   the distractors prevented contingency detection in the unaware group.
   The third group (learned aware) was not informed about the
   contingencies, but learned them despite the distractors. Main effects of
   contingency awareness on conditioned responses emerged in several brain
   structures. Post hoc tests revealed differential dorsal anterior
   cingulate, insula and ventral striatum responses in aware conditioning
   only, whereas the amygdala was activated independent of contingency
   awareness. Differential responses of the hippocampus were specifically
   observed in learned aware subjects, indicating a role in the development
   of contingency awareness. The orbitofrontal cortex showed varying
   response patterns: lateral structures showed higher responses in
   instructed aware than unaware subjects, the opposite was true for medial
   parts. Conditioned subjective and electrodermal responses emerged only
   in the two aware groups. These results confirm the independence of
   conditioned amygdala responses from contingency awareness and indicate
   specific neural circuits for different aspects of fear acquisition in
   unaware, learned aware and instructed aware subjects.}},

Abstract = {{Trust lies at the heart of person perception and interpersonal decision
   making. In two studies, we investigated physical temperature as one
   factor that can influence human trust behavior, and the insula as a
   possible neural substrate. Participants briefly touched either a cold or
   warm pack, and then played an economic trust game. Those primed with
   cold invested less with an anonymous partner, revealing lesser
   interpersonal trust, as compared to those who touched a warm pack. In
   Study 2, we examined neural activity during trust-related processes
   after a temperature manipulation using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging. The left-anterior insular region activated more strongly than
   baseline only when the trust decision was preceded by touching a cold
   pack, and not a warm pack. In addition, greater activation within
   bilateral insula was identified during the decision phase followed by a
   cold manipulation, contrasted to warm. These results suggest that the
   insula may be a key shared neural substrate that mediates the influence

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Neural correlates involved in the formation of negative impression from
   face were investigated using event-related functional magnetic resonance
   imaging and a partial conditioning paradigm. Eighteen normal volunteers
   underwent imaging while they viewed the faces of two unfamiliar
   individuals: one individual's face was partially accompanied by negative
   emotion but the other's was not. After the volunteers learned the
   relationship between the faces and the emotion, they formed a more
   negative impression of the person's face when the emotion was presented.
   Subtraction analysis of the individuals' neutral faces revealed
   activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and superior temporal
   sulcus, but this activity did not correlate with the change of
   impression from face. On the other hand, the response in the left
   amygdala negatively correlated with the change of impression from face
   in the first run. Time modulation analysis revealed that activity in the
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex associated with negative emotion was the
   largest in the initial part of the acquisition. These results suggest
   that a negative impression from face may be formed by orchestrated
   activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate
   cortex and amygdala, and that the activity has a prominent role in the
   initial acquisition of negative emotion.}},

Abstract = {{The `own-age bias' in face processing suggests that the age of a face
   constitutes one important factor that influences attention to and memory
   for faces. The present experiment investigated electrophysiological
   correlates of processing faces of younger and older individuals. Younger
   participants were presented with pictures of unfamiliar younger and
   older faces in the context of a gender categorization task. A comparison
   of event-related potentials showed that early components are sensitive
   to faces of different ages: (i) larger positive potential peaking at 160
   ms (P200) for older than younger faces at fronto-central electrodes;
   (ii) larger negative potential peaking at 252 ms (N200) for younger than
   older faces at fronto-central electrodes; (iii) larger negative-going
   deflection peaking at 320 ms (N250) for younger than older faces at
   occipito-temporal electrodes; and (iv) larger late positive potential
   peaking at 420 ms (LPP 420) for older than younger faces at parietal and

   a previously published study of faces of different races as suggesting

   rats were provided with replacement somatosensory stimulation intended
   to simulate maternal licking. There are at least 2 forms of impulsivity
   and we compared rats on 1 test of impulsive action (differential
   reinforcement of low rates of responding-DRL-20s) and 2 tests of
   impulsive choice (delay discounting and fixed consecutive number
   schedule-FCN). We found that AR rats are more action impulsive; however,
   this effect can be reduced by maternal licking-like stimulation. In
   contrast, AR rats did not display an increase in impulsive choice.
   Overall, these experiments show that early life maternal and social
   separation have different effects on the 2 forms of impulsivity.}},

Abstract = {{Risk-taking behavior is characterized by pursuit of reward in spite of
   potential negative consequences. Dopamine neurotransmission along the
   mesocorticolimbic pathway is a potential modulator of risk behavior. In
   patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), impulse control disorder (ICD)
   can result from dopaminergic medication use, particularly dopamine
   agonists (DAA). Behaviors associated with ICD include hypersexuality as
   well as compulsive gambling, shopping, and eating, and these behaviors
   are potentially linked to alterations to risk processing. Using the
   Balloon Analogue Risk Task, we assessed the role of agonist therapy on
   risk-taking behavior in PD patients with (n = 22) and without (n = 19)
   active ICD symptoms. Patients performed the task both ``on{''} and
   ``off{''} DAA. DAA increased risk-taking in PD patients with active ICD
   symptoms, but it did not affect risk behavior of PD controls. DAA dose
   was also important in explaining risk behavior. Both groups similarly
   reduced their risk-taking in high compared to low risk conditions and
   following the occurrence of a negative consequence, suggesting that ICD
   patients do not necessarily differ in their abilities to process and
   adjust to some aspects of negative consequences. Our findings suggest
   dopaminergic augmentation of risk-taking behavior as a potential
   contributing mechanism for the emergence of ICD in PD patients.}},

Abstract = {{The neuromodulator serotonin regulates auditory processing and can
   increase within minutes in response to stimuli like broadband noise as
   well as nonauditory stressors. Little is known about the serotonergic
   response in the auditory system to more natural stimuli such as social
   interactions. Using carbon-fiber voltammetry, we measured extracellular
   serotonin in the auditory midbrain of resident male mice during
   encounters with a male intruder. Serotonin increased in the inferior
   colliculus (IC) over the course of a 15 minute interaction, but not when
   mice were separated with a perforated barrier. Several behaviors,
   including the amount of immobility and anogenital investigation
   performed by the resident, were correlated with the serotonergic
   response. Multiple intrinsic factors associated with individual mice
   also correlated with the serotonergic response. One of these was age:
   older mice had smaller serotonergic responses to the social interaction.
   In a second interaction, individual identity predicted serotonergic
   responses that were highly consistent with those in the first
   interaction, even when mice were paired with different intruders.
   Serotonin was also significantly elevated in the second social
   interaction relative to the first, suggesting a role for social
   experience. These findings show that during social interaction,
   serotonin in the IC is influenced by extrinsic factors such as the
   directness of social interaction and intrinsic factors including age,
   individual identity, and experience.}},

Abstract = {{The use of food products designed to mimic the sensory properties of
   sweet and fat while providing fewer calories has been promoted as a
   method for reducing food intake and body weight. However, such products
   may interfere with a learned relationship between the sensory properties
   of food and the caloric consequences of consuming those foods. In the
   present experiment, we examined whether use of the fat substitute,
   olestra, affect energy balance by comparing the effects of consuming
   high-fat, high-calorie potato chips to the effects of consuming potato
   chips that sometimes signaled high calories (using high-fat potato
   chips) and that sometimes signaled lower calories (using nonfat potato
   chips manufactured with the fat substitute olestra). Food intake, body
   weight gain and adiposity were greater for rats that consumed both the
   high-calorie chips and the low-calorie chips with olestra compared to
   rats that consumed consuming only the high-calorie chips, but only if
   animals were also consuming a chow diet that was high in fat and
   calories. However, rats previously exposed to both the high-and
   low-calorie chips exhibited increased body weight gain, food intake and
   adiposity when they were subsequently provided with a high fat, high
   calorie chow diet suggesting that experience with the chips containing
   olestra affected the ability to predict high calories based on the
   sensory properties of fat. These results extend the generality of
   previous findings that interfering with a predictive relationship
   between sensory properties of foods and calories may contribute to
   dysregulation of energy balance, overweight and obesity.}},

Title = {{Glossopharyngeal Nerve Transection Impairs Unconditioned Avoidance of

Volume = {{125}},

Abstract = {{There is growing evidence of heterogeneity among responses to bitter
   stimuli at the peripheral, central and behavioral levels. For instance,
   the glossopharyngeal (GL) nerve and neurons receiving its projections
   are more responsive to bitter stimuli than the chorda tympani (CT)
   nerve, and this is particularly true for some bitter stimuli like PROP
   \& cycloheximide that stimulate the GL to a far greater extent. Given
   this information, we hypothesized that cutting the GL would have a
   greater effect on behavioral avoidance of cycloheximide and PROP than
   quinine and denatonium, which also stimulate the CT, albeit to a lesser
   degree than salts and acids. Forty male SD rats were divided into four
   surgery groups: bilateral GL transection (GLX), chorda tympani
   transection (CTX), SHAM surgery, and combined transection (CTX + GLX).
   Postsurgical avoidance functions were generated for the four bitter
   stimuli using a brief-access test. GLX significantly compromised
   avoidance compared to both CTX and SHAM groups for all stimuli (p <
   .02), while CTX and SHAM groups did not differ. Contrary to our
   hypothesis, GLX had a greater effect on quinine than cycloheximide (mean
   shift of 1.02 vs. 0.27 log(10) units). Moreover, combined CTX + GLX
   transection shifted the concentration-response function further than GLX
   alone for every stimulus except cycloheximide (ps < .03), suggesting
   that the GSP nerve is capable of maintaining avoidance of this stimulus
   to a large degree. This hypothesis is supported by reports of
   cycloheximide-responsive cells with GSP-innervated receptive fields in
   the NST and PBN.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that microinjections of the GABA-A agonist
   muscimol into the median raphe nucleus (MR) result in large increases in
   the intake of solid foods. In the current study, we used microstructural
   techniques to characterize the effects of intra-MR muscimol injections
   on the consumption of either a 0.05 M or a 0.29 M sucrose solution.
   After injections of either saline or muscimol, animals consumed more of
   the 0.29 M than the 0.05 M solution, an effect which resulted primarily
   from increases in the initial rate of consumption with no change in the
   rate at which licking decayed across the test session. In contrast,
   intra-MR muscimol injections had little effect on the initial licking
   rate, but greatly increased meal duration, indicating that this
   treatment affected ingestion in a different way than did altering the
   sucrose concentration. Muscimol injections produced a significantly
   larger increase in the intake of the 0.29 M than of the 0.05 M solution.
   Intra-MR muscimol injections did not alter the within burst rate of
   licking, suggesting that they did not affect the functioning of the
   licking pattern generator. In contrast, these injections did increase
   the number of licks contained within ``clusters,{''} that is groups of
   licks separated from each other by intervals of more than 0.5 sec. These
   findings show that inactivation of the MR produces a powerful effect on
   the intake of liquid diets, and that the nature of this effect is
   different from that produced here by changes in sucrose concentration
   and from those reported after pharmacological manipulations of a number
   of other brain systems. We additionally discuss several theoretical
   issues arising in the interpretation of microstructural data.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the role of context in reacquisition of extinguished

   mixed history of reinforcement. Reacquisition was also rapid after
   extended extinction training. Nonetheless, context did significantly
   influence reacquisition via affecting latency to first response: rats
   took significantly longer to initiate responding when tested in the
   extinction context. These results suggest that reacquisition of drug and
   reward seeking is determined by an inhibitory influence caused by the
   extinction context and a facilitatory influence caused by reintroduction
   of the reinforcer (Bouton, 1993).}},

Abstract = {{Four experiments with rat subjects examined whether D-cycloserine (DCS),
   a partial NMDA agonist, facilitates the extinction of operant
   lever-pressing reinforced by food. Previous research has demonstrated
   that DCS facilitates extinction learning with methods that involve
   Pavlovian extinction. In the current experiments, operant conditioning
   occurred in Context A, extinction in Context B, and then testing
   occurred in both the extinction and conditioning contexts. Experiments
   1A and 1B tested the effects of three doses of DCS (5, 15, and 30 mg/kg)
   on the extinction of lever pressing trained as a free operant.
   Experiment 2 examined their effects when extinction of the free operant
   was conducted in the presence of nonresponse-contingent deliveries of
   the reinforcer (that theoretically reduced the role of generalization
   decrement in suppressing responding). Experiment 3 examined their
   effects on extinction of a discriminated operant, that is, one that had
   been reinforced in the presence of a discriminative stimulus, but not in
   its absence. A strong ABA renewal effect was observed in all four
   experiments during testing. However, despite the use of DCS doses and a
   drug administration procedure that facilitates the extinction of
   Pavlovian learning, there was no evidence in any experiment that DCS
   facilitated operant extinction learning assessed in either the
   extinction or the conditioning context. DCS may primarily facilitate
   learning processes that underlie Pavlovian, rather than purely operant,
   extinction.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the role of the Caenorhabditis elegans CREB (cAMP
   response element binding protein) homologue, crh-1, in response to tap
   (nonlocalized mechanosensory stimulation) and tap habituation. Worms
   with a loss-of-function mutation in crh-1 performed smaller reversals in
   response to tap than did wild-type worms and did not show long-term
   memory for spaced training 24-hr posttraining; however, they did show
   short-term habituation to tap stimuli when stimuli were presented at
   both 10-s and 60-s interstimulus intervals, and showed 12-hr
   intermediate memory for spaced habituation training (intermediate-term
   memory). Expressing CRH-1 broadly throughout the nervous system and in a
   subset of interneurons of the tap withdrawal circuit, but not in the
   mechanosensory neurons, rescued the long-term memory defects observed in
   crh-1 mutants. Here we show for the first time that CREB is required for
   long-term habituation and show that the interneurons of the tap
   withdrawal response circuit are the locus of plasticity for long-term
   mechanosensory habituation in C. elegans.}},

Abstract = {{The formation of an integrated memory for a pattern of stimulation could
   be based on the elements of that pattern becoming directly linked to one
   another, or by each of the elements becoming linked to a shared separate
   configural representation. These 2 accounts have proven difficult to
   discriminate between. Here, rats received exposure to four patterns of
   stimulation, each consisting of an auditory stimulus, a visual context,
   and a time of day; and we examined whether pre-training lesions to the
   hippocampus influenced memory for the patterns. These lesions abolished
   pattern memory that required configural processes (Experiments 1A and
   1B) but had no effect on pattern memory that could be supported by
   elemental processes (Experiment 2). This dissociation provides support
   for the views that elemental and configural processes ordinarily support
   pattern memory and that rats with lesions to the hippocampus are left
   reliant on elemental processes.}},

Abstract = {{The retrosplenial cortex (RSP) is highly interconnected with medial
   temporal lobe structures, yet relatively little is known about its
   specific contributions to learning and memory. One possibility is that
   RSP is involved in forming associations between multiple sensory
   stimuli. Indeed, damage to RSP disrupts learning about spatial or
   contextual cues and also impairs learning about co-occurring conditioned
   stimuli (CSs). Two experiments were conducted to test this notion more
   rigorously. In Experiment 1, rats were trained in a serial feature
   negative discrimination task consisting of reinforced presentations of a
   tone alone and nonreinforced serial presentations of a light followed by
   the tone. Thus, in contrast to prior studies, this paradigm involved
   serial presentation of conditioned stimuli (CS), rather than
   simultaneous presentation. Rats with damage to RSP failed to acquire the
   discrimination, indicating that RSP is required for forming associations
   between sensory stimuli regardless of whether they occur serially or
   simultaneously. In Experiment 2, a sensory preconditioning task was used
   to determine if RSP was necessary for forming associations between
   stimuli even in the absence of reinforcement. During the first phase of
   this procedure, one auditory stimulus was paired with a light while a
   second auditory stimulus was presented alone. In the next phase of
   training, the same light was paired with food. During the final phase of
   the procedure both auditory stimuli were presented alone during a single
   session. Control, but not RSP-lesioned rats, exhibited more food cup
   behavior following presentation of the auditory cue that was previously
   paired with light compared with the unpaired auditory stimulus,
   indicating that a stimulus-stimulus association was formed during the
   first phase of training. These results support the idea that RSP has a
   fundamental role in forming associations between environmental stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{To elucidate the cognitive structures of animals, neuroscientists use
   several behavioral tasks. Therefore, it is imperative to have a firm
   understanding of each task's behavioral parameters in order to parse out
   possible task effects. We compare two operant discrimination tasks
   (Go/No-Go: GNG; Two-Alternative Choice: TAC) that are commonly used in
   olfactory research. Past research has suggested that solving the two
   tasks requires divergent cognitive strategies. One hypothesis is that
   the two tasks differ in how an animal optimizes reward rate by means of
   a speed-accuracy trade-off (SAT). If this is true, then changing tasks
   could give researchers an additional tool to understand animal
   cognition. However, no study has systematically analyzed the two tasks
   in parallel using odor stimuli. Using standardized training protocols,
   we test GNG and TAC in parallel. Our protocols allow us to isolate the
   stimulus sampling period from a general reaction time period. We find
   that the two tasks do not differ with regard to the stimulus sampling
   period and conclude that the two tasks do not differ in the amount of
   time it takes an animal to perform a discrimination. Instead, tasks
   differ in the time it takes to make an overt behavioral response, with
   GNG showing shorter periods than TAC. We also find no evidence of rats
   using either task-specific or intertrial interval-dependent SAT schema
   in order to optimize reward rate. We show that similarities between
   dependent variables, with the possible exception of response delay,
   appear to be under experimenter control.}},

Volume = {{125}},

Abstract = {{Heart rate conditioning is used as an index of conditioned fear and is
   important for understanding disorders of anxiety and stress, including
   post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). One important feature of PTSD is
   that patients generalize conditioned fear from danger signals to safety
   signals especially when the two signals have overlapping features. What
   has not been determined is whether generalization occurs between
   unconditioned stimuli with overlapping features. In the current
   experiment, heart rate conditioning and conditioning-specific reflex
   modification of rabbit heart rate were examined as a function of two
   different unconditioned stimulus locations. Heart rate conditioning
   occurred at identical terminal levels whether electrical stimulation was
   presented near the eye or on the back. Despite different heart rate
   response topographies to electrical stimulation at the two locations,
   conditioning-specific reflex modification was detected near the eye and
   on the back and appeared to generalize between the locations.
   Interestingly, only conditioning-specific reflex modification detected
   on the back persisted for a week after heart rate conditioning. This
   persistence may be a model for some features of post traumatic stress
   disorder. Overgeneralization of unconditioned responses to unconditioned
   stimuli similar to the trauma may also be an important aspect of PTSD
   modeled here.}},

Title = {{Spontaneous Recovery But Not Reinstatement of the Extinguished

Abstract = {{Reinstatement-the return of an extinguished conditioned response (CR)
   after reexposure to the unconditioned stimulus (US)-and spontaneous
   recovery-the return of an extinguished CR with the passage of time-are 2
   of 4 well-established phenomena that demonstrate that extinction does
   not erase the conditioned stimulus (CS)-US association. However,
   reinstatement of extinguished eyeblink CRs has never been demonstrated,
   and spontaneous recovery of extinguished eyeblink CRs has not been
   systematically demonstrated in rodent eyeblink conditioning. In
   Experiment 1, US reexposure was administered 24 hr prior to a
   reinstatement test. In Experiment 2, US reexposure was administered 5
   min prior to a reinstatement test. In Experiment 3, a long, discrete cue
   (a houselight), present in all phases of training and testing, served as
   a context within which each trial occurred to maximize context
   processing, which in other preparations has been shown to be required
   for reinstatement. In Experiment 4, an additional group was included
   that received footshock exposure, rather than US reexposure, between
   extinction and test, and contextual freezing was measured prior to test.
   Spontaneous recovery was robust in Experiments 3 and 4. In Experiment 4,
   context freezing was strong in a group given footshock exposure but not
   in a group given eye shock US reexposure. There was no reinstatement
   observed in any experiment. With stimulus conditions that produce
   eyeblink conditioning and research designs that produce reinstatement in
   other forms of classical conditioning, we observed spontaneous recovery
   but not reinstatement of extinguished eyeblink CRs. This suggests that
   reinstatement, but not spontaneous recovery, is a preparation-or
   substrate-dependent phenomenon.}},

Volume = {{125}},

Abstract = {{During Pavlovian conditioning the expression of a conditioned response
   typically serves as evidence that an association between a conditioned
   stimulus (CS) and an unconditioned stimulus (UCS) has been learned.
   However, learning-related changes in the unconditioned response (UCR)
   produced by a predictable UCS can also develop. In the present study, we
   investigated learning-related reductions in the magnitude of the
   unconditioned skin conductance response (SCR). Healthy volunteers
   participated in a differential conditioning study in which one tone
   (CS+) was paired with a loud white-noise UCS and a second tone (CS-) was
   presented alone. In addition, probe trials that consisted of UCS
   presentations paired with the CS+ (CS + UCS) and CS- (CS - UCS), as well
   as presentations of the UCS alone were included to assess UCR
   diminution. SCR and participants' expectations of UCS presentation were
   monitored during conditioning. Greater diminution of the UCR was
   observed to the UCS when it followed the CS+ compared to when it
   followed the CS- or was presented alone. Further, UCR amplitude showed
   an inverse relationship with the participants' ratings of UCS
   expectancy. However, conditioned UCR diminution was also observed
   independent of differential UCS expectancies. Our findings demonstrate
   conditioned diminution of the unconditioned SCR. Further, these findings
   suggest that although UCR amplitude is modified by conscious
   expectations of the UCS, conditioned diminution of the UCR can be
   expressed independent of learning-related changes in these expectations.}},

Abstract = {{Reducing reconsolidation of reactivated traumatic memories may offer a
   novel pharmacological treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder
   (PTSD). Preclinical research is needed to identify candidate drugs. We
   evaluated the ability of postreactivation mifepristone (RU38486, a
   glucocorticoid antagonist), alone and in combination with propranolol (a
   beta-adrenergic blocker), both given systemically, to reduce
   cue-conditioned fear in rats. On Day 1, a 30-s tone conditioned stimulus
   (CS) was paired with an electric shock unconditioned stimulus (US). On
   Day 2, the CS was presented without the US (reactivation), and the
   freezing conditioned response (CR) was measured. This was immediately
   followed by subcutaneous injection of vehicle, mifepristone 30 mg/kg,
   propranolol 10 mg/kg, or both. On Day 3, the CR was again measured as a
   test of postreactivation long-term memory (PR-LTM). On Day 10, the CR
   was again measured to evaluate spontaneous recovery. On Day 11, the US
   was presented alone (reinstatement). On Day 12, the CR was again
   measured. A fifth group received mifepristone without the CS
   presentation (nonreactivation) on Day 2. A sixth group was tested four
   hours after the Day 2 mifepristone injection to measure postreactivation
   short-term memory. Postreactivation, but not nonreactivation,
   mifepristone produced a decrement in the CR that did not undergo
   spontaneous recovery and underwent only modest reinstatement.
   Mifepristone did not exert its effect when administered concurrently
   with propranolol. Postreactivation mifepristone did not impair
   short-term memory. Systemic mifepristone blocks the reconsolidation of
   cue-conditioned fear in rats. Concurrent administration of propranolol
   prevents this effect. Postreactivation mifepristone may be a promising
   treatment for PTSD, but not necessarily in combination with propranolol.}},

Abstract = {{A broader understanding of the neural basis of social behavior in
   primates requires the use of species-specific stimuli that elicit
   spontaneous, but reproducible and tractable behaviors. In this context
   of natural behaviors, individual variation can further inform about the
   factors that influence social interactions. To approximate natural
   social interactions similar to those documented by field studies, we
   used unedited video footage to induce in viewer monkeys spontaneous
   facial expressions and looking patterns in the laboratory setting. Three
   adult male monkeys (Macaca mulatta), previously behaviorally and
   genetically (5-HTTLPR) characterized, were monitored while they watched
   10 s video segments depicting unfamiliar monkeys (movie monkeys)
   displaying affiliative, neutral, and aggressive behaviors. The gaze and
   head orientation of the movie monkeys alternated between ``averted{''}
   and ``directed{''} at the viewer. The viewers were not reinforced for
   watching the movies, thus their looking patterns indicated their
   interest and social engagement with the stimuli. The behavior of the
   movie monkey accounted for differences in the looking patterns and
   facial expressions displayed by the viewers. We also found multiple
   significant differences in the behavior of the viewers that correlated
   with their interest in these stimuli. These socially relevant dynamic
   stimuli elicited spontaneous social behaviors, such as eye-contact
   induced reciprocation of facial expression, gaze aversion, and gaze
   following, that were previously not observed in response to static
   images. This approach opens a unique opportunity to understanding the
   mechanisms that trigger spontaneous social behaviors in humans and
   nonhuman primates.}},

Abstract = {{Whether nonhuman primates exhibit population level right manual bias
   remains a controversial topic. In captive baboons, population-level
   right-handedness has been reported for both coordinated bimanual actions
   and communicative gestures. However, some authors remain skeptical of
   these findings on both methodological and theoretical grounds. Here, we
   demonstrated the robustness and the consistency across time of the
   pattern of right-handedness for a species-specific communicative gesture
   in olive baboons (Papio anubis). First, we showed significant
   correlations in the 26 retested baboons for the measures of hand
   preferences between the first and the second session conducted 4 years
   later (2005-2009) by an observer blind to the previous handedness data.
   Second, the replication of the study in 96 novel individuals revealed a
   similar degree of population-level right-handedness than the one
   expressed in the first group of 66 subjects investigated in 2005. The
   implications of the findings are discussed within a theoretical
   framework about the origin of hemispheric specialization for language.}},

Abstract = {{Age-specific behavioral and neural characteristics may predispose
   adolescents to initiate and escalate use of alcohol and drugs.
   Adolescents may avidly seek novel experiences, including drugs of abuse,
   because of enhanced incentive motivation for drugs and natural rewards,
   perhaps especially when that incentive motivation is sensitized by prior
   drug exposure. Using a Pavlovian conditioned approach (PCA) procedure,
   sign-tracking (ST) and goal-tracking (GT) behavior was examined in
   amphetamine-sensitized and control adolescent and adult female
   Sprague-Dawley rats, with expression of elevated ST behavior used to
   index enhanced incentive motivation for reward-associated cues. Rats
   were first exposed to a sensitizing regimen of amphetamine injections
   (3.0 mg/kg/ml d-amphetamine per day) or given saline (0.9\% wt/vol) once
   daily for 4 days. Expression of ST and GT was then examined over 8 days
   of PCA training consisting of 25 pairings of an 8-s presentation of an
   illuminated lever immediately followed by response-independent delivery
   of a banana-flavored food pellet. Results showed that adults clearly
   displayed more ST behavior than adolescents, reflected via both more
   contacts with, and shorter latencies to approach, the lever. Prior
   amphetamine sensitization increased ST (but not GT) behaviors regardless
   of age. Thus, when indexed via ST, incentive motivation was found to be
   greater in adults than adolescents, with a prior history of amphetamine
   exposure generally sensitizing incentive motivation for cues predicting
   a food reward regardless of age.}},

Abstract = {{The pelvic nerve is known to play a role in the behavioral and

   present study extended the analysis of the contribution of the

   bilateral hypogastric nerve transection, bilateral pelvic nerve
   transection, or transection of both the hypogastric and pelvic nerves.
   Rats with pelvic nerve transection were less likely to exit the male
   compartment, took longer to exit the male compartment following
   intromissions, and returned to the male more quickly following
   intromissions compared to rats with an intact pelvic nerve. In contrast,
   hypogastric nerve transection alone did not affect paced mating and had
   no modulating effect on the paced mating behavior of rats with pelvic
   nerve transection. Our results support the view that key aspects of

Abstract = {{Traditional models of drug-seeking behavior have shown that exposure to
   associated environmental cues can trigger relapse. These learned
   associations take place during repeated drug administration, resulting
   in conditioned reinforcement. Although considerable investigation has
   occurred regarding simple conditioned stimuli, less is known about
   complex environmental cues, particularly those that may be salient in
   human addiction. Recent studies indicate that music can serve as a
   contextual conditioned stimulus in rats and influence drug-seeking
   behavior during abstinence. The purpose of the present study was to
   further assess the effectiveness of music as a conditioned stimulus in
   rats, to determine rats' preferences for two contrasting pieces of
   music, and to determine rats' preferences for music versus silence. To
   this end, we created an apparatus that gave instrumental control of
   musical choice (Miles Davis vs. Beethoven) to the rats themselves. After
   determining baseline musical preference, animals were conditioned with
   cocaine (10 mg/kg) to the music they initially preferred least, with
   alternating conditioning sessions pairing saline with the music
   preferred most. The animals were subsequently tested in a drug-free
   state to determine what effect this conditioning had on musical
   preference. The results indicate that music serves as an effective
   contextual conditioned stimulus, significantly increasing both musical
   preference and locomotor activity after repeated cocaine conditioning.
   Furthermore, we found that rats initially favor silence over music, but
   that this preference can be altered as a result of cocaine-paired
   conditioning. These findings demonstrate that, after repeated
   association with reward (cocaine), music can engender a conditioned
   context preference in rats; these findings are consistent with other
   evidence showing that musical contextual cues can reinstate drug-seeking
   behavior in rats.}},

Abstract = {{Dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a central feature of many
   psychiatric disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
   (ADHD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia, and bipolar
   disorder. Thus, understanding molecular influences on PFC function
   through basic research in animals is essential to rational drug
   development. In this review, we discuss the molecular signaling events
   initiated by norepinephrine and dopamine that strengthen working memory
   function mediated by the dorsolateral PFC under optimal conditions, and
   weaken working memory function during uncontrollable stress. We also
   discuss how these intracellular mechanisms can be compromised in
   psychiatric disorders, and how novel treatments based on these findings
   may restore a molecular environment conducive to PFC regulation of
   behavior, thought and emotion. Examples of successful translation from
   animals to humans include guanfacine for the treatment of ADHD and
   related PFC disorders, and prazosin for the treatment of PTSD.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with damage to the prefrontal cortex (PFC)-especially the
   ventral and medial parts of PFC often show a marked inability to make
   choices that meet their needs and goals. These decision-making
   impairments often reflect both a deficit in learning concerning the
   consequences of a choice, as well as deficits in the ability to adapt
   future choices based on experienced value of the current choice. Thus,
   areas of PFC must support some value computations that are necessary for
   optimal choice. However, recent frameworks of decision making have

Abstract = {{Several studies in nonhuman primates have shown that neurons in the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex have activity that persists throughout
   the delay period in delayed matching to sample tasks, and age-related
   changes in the microcolumnar organization of the prefrontal cortex are
   significantly correlated with age-related declines in cognition.
   Activity that persists beyond the presentation of a stimulus could
   mediate working memory processes, and disruption of those processes
   could account for memory deficits that often accompany the aging
   process. These potential memory and aging mechanisms are being
   systematically examined with eyeblink conditioning paradigms in
   nonprimate mammalian animal models including the rabbit. The trace
   version of the conditioning paradigm is a particularly good system to
   explore declarative memory since humans do not acquire trace
   conditioning if they are unable to become cognitively aware of the
   association between a conditioning tone and an airpuff to the eye. This
   conditioning paradigm has been used to show that the hippocampus and
   cerebellum interact functionally since both conditioned responses and
   conditioned hippocampal pyramidal neuron activity are abolished
   following lesions of the cerebellar nuclei and since hippocampal lesions
   prevent or abolish trace conditioned blinks. However, because there are
   no direct connections between the hippocampal formation and the
   cerebellum, and because the hippocampus is not necessary for trace
   conditioning after a period of consolidation has elapsed, we and others
   have been examining the prefrontal cortex for its role in
   forebrain-dependent trace eyeblink conditioning. This review examines
   some of the literature which suggests that the prefrontal cortex serves
   to orchestrate a neuronal network that interacts with the cerebellum to
   mediate adaptively timed conditioned responses.}},

Abstract = {{Executive function allows us to interact with the world in a purposive,
   goal-directed manner. It relies on several cognitive control operations
   that are mediated by different regions of the prefrontal cortex. While
   much of our knowledge about the functional subdivisions of the
   prefrontal cortex comes from the systematic assessment of patients with
   brain damage, animal models have served as the predominant tool for
   investigating specific structure function relationships within the
   prefrontal cortex, especially as they relate to complex executive
   behaviors. These studies generally involve the targeted disruption of
   neural circuits combined with behavioral testing using carefully
   designed cognitive paradigms. In this review, I will describe a broad
   range of such experiments conducted in rats and monkeys that together
   reveal the distinct contributions of dorsal, medial, and ventral
   prefrontal cortex to different aspects of executive function. The
   effects of lesions and local pharmacological manipulations have provided
   valuable insights into the neural underpinnings of executive function
   and its neurochemical modulation. Despite the challenges associated with
   establishing a precise homology between animal models of prefrontal
   function and the human brain, such models currently offer the best means
   to systematically investigate the cognitive building blocks of executive
   function. This helps define the neural circuits that lead to a range of
   neurological and psychiatric disorders and facilitate the development of
   effective therapeutic strategies to ameliorate the associated cognitive
   impairments.}},

Abstract = {{It has been proposed that the cognitive dysfunction observed in patients
   with schizophrenia reflects a failure in cognitive control, in
   particular an inability to use task-relevant information to guide
   behavior. Using a prefrontal-dependent task designed to reflect aspects
   of cue and response conflict seen in human cognitive paradigms, we
   examined the influence of prefrontal dopamine receptor manipulation on
   the contextual control of response conflict. Rats were trained on two
   biconditional discrimination tasks, one auditory and one visual, in two
   discriminably different contexts. At test, audiovisual compounds of
   these training stimuli were presented, in extinction, in each of the
   training contexts. These compounds were formed in such a way that the
   individual elements previously dictated different responses during
   training, termed incongruent trials. Studies have shown that rats use
   contextual information to disambiguate the conflicting information
   provided by incongruent compounds, responding in manner that is
   appropriate to the stimulus element that was trained in the test
   context. Direct infusion of the D1 receptor agonist SKF-38393 into the
   prelimbic cortex was found to modulate incongruent trial performance in
   a manner that was dependent upon baseline performance: animals in the
   low baseline group demonstrated improved incongruent performance
   following infusion of SKF-38393 into the prelimbic cortex. In contrast,
   high performers showed a reduction in accuracy during incongruent
   compounds. This paradigm provides a reliable framework for assessing the
   efficacy of preclinical agents in treating the cognitive impairments
   seen in frontal-related disorders such as schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and basolateral nucleus of the amygdala
   (BLA) are important neural regions in responding adaptively to changes
   in the incentive value of reward. Recent evidence suggests these
   structures may be differentially engaged in effort and cue-guided choice
   behavior. In 2 T-maze experiments, we examined the effects of bilateral
   lesions of either BLA or OFC on (1) effortful choices in which rats
   could climb a barrier for a high reward or select a low reward with no
   effort and (2) effortful choices when a visual cue signaled changes in
   reward magnitude. In both experiments, BLA rats displayed transient work
   aversion, choosing the effortless low reward option. OFC rats were work
   averse only in the no cue conditions, displaying a pattern of attenuated
   recovery from the cue conditions signaling reward unavailability in the
   effortful arm. Control measures rule out an inability to discriminate
   the cue in either lesion group.}},

Abstract = {{Morphological changes in the anterior cingulate cortex are found in
   subjects with schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
   and obsessive compulsive disorder. These changes are hypothesized to
   underlie the impairments these individuals show on tasks that require
   cognitive control. The anterior cingulate cortex has previously been
   shown to be active in situations involving high conflict, presentation
   of salient, distracting stimuli, and error processing, that is,
   situations that occur when a shift in attention or responding is
   required. However, there is some uncertainty as to what specific role
   the anterior cingulate cortex plays in these situations. The current
   study used converging evidence from two behavioral paradigms to
   determine the effects of excitotoxic lesions in the anterior cingulate
   cortex on executive control. The first assay tests reversal learning,
   attentional set formation and shifting. The second assesses sustained
   attention with and without distractors. Animals with anterior cingulate
   cortex lesions were impaired during reinforcement reversals,
   discriminations that required subjects to disregard previously relevant
   stimulus attributes and showed a more rapid decline in attentional
   ability than Sham-Lesioned subjects when maintaining sustained attention
   for extended periods of time. These results are consistent with the
   hypothesis that the anterior cingulate cortex is involved in attending
   to stimulus attributes that currently predict reinforcement in the
   presence of previously relevant, salient distractors and maintaining
   sustained attention over prolonged time on task.}},

Abstract = {{Two experiments compared spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs; a rodent
   model of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) and Wistar rats (a
   normoactive control strain), on the acquisition of a set-shifting
   strategy. In Experiment 1, SHRs and Wistar rats were equivalent in
   trials to criterion to learn a brightness or a texture discrimination
   but SHRs were faster than Wistar rats in shifting to the opposite
   discrimination when there was 1 or 2 days between the initial
   discrimination and the shift. In Experiment 2, SHRs and Wistar rats were
   equivalent in shifting when the shift between discriminations occurred
   immediately after a criterion had been met in the first discrimination.
   The results are discussed in terms of a failure of SHRs to store or
   retrieve an initial discrimination and/or latent inhibition over a
   delay, leading to faster acquisition of a set-shift. This failure in
   storage or retrieval may be the result of a hypoactive dopamine system
   in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens shell as well as
   abnormalities in entorhinal cortex in SHRs.}},

Abstract = {{The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been implicated in various
   attentional functions. This experiment examined the involvement of mPFC
   subregions in the allocation of attention in learning and action as a
   function of the predictive accuracy of cues. Rats with dorsal
   (encompassing anterior cingulate, prelimbic, and infralimbic cortices)
   or ventral (encompassing mainly infralimbic and dorsopeduncular cortices
   and tenia tecta) mPFC lesions were trained in a multiple-choice
   discrimination task in which operant nosepoke responses to some visual
   cues were consistently (100\%) reinforced (CRF) with food, whereas
   responses to other visual cues were partially (50\%) reinforced (PRF).
   In challenge tests designed to assess attention in the control of
   action, responding was directed more to CRF cues than to PRF cues in
   sham and dorsal rnPFC-lesioned rats, but ventral mPFC-lesioned rats
   showed similar levels of responding to both CRF and PRF cues.
   Nevertheless, when given a choice between simultaneously presented CRF
   and PRF cues in a cue competition test, all groups responded more to CRF
   cues. In a subsequent Pavlovian overshadowing phase designed to assess
   attention in the acquisition of new learning, previously trained CRF
   cues overshadowed conditioning to novel auditory cues more than did PRF
   cues in dorsal mPFC-lesioned rats, whereas the opposite pattern was
   observed in sham and ventral mPFC-lesioned rats. These results suggest a
   dissociation within the mPFC in the use of reinforcement prediction
   information to allocate attention for new learning and for the control
   of action.}},

Abstract = {{There is good evidence that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is
   involved in different aspects of recognition memory. However, the mPFC
   is a heterogeneous structure, and the contribution of the prelimbic (PL)
   and infralimbic (IL) cortices to recognition memory has not been
   investigated. Similarly, the role of different neuromodulators within
   the mPFC in these processes is poorly understood. To this end, we tested
   animals with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of the PL and IL mPFC on
   three tests of object recognition memory that required judgments about
   recency, object location, and object identity. In the recency task,
   lesions to both PL and IL severely impaired animals' ability to
   differentiate between old (earlier presented) and recently presented
   familiar objects. Relative to sham and PL animals, the IL lesion also
   disrupted performance on the object location task. However, both lesions
   left novel object recognition intact. These data confirm previous
   reports that the mPFC is not required for discriminations based on the
   relative familiarity of individual objects. However, these results
   demonstrate that catecholamines within the PL cortex are crucial for
   relative recency judgments and suggest a possible role for neural
   processing within the IL in the integration of information about object
   location.}},

   postnatal Purkinje cell degeneration (Wang et al., 2010), and standard
   delay eyeblink conditioning was performed in the conditional knockout
   mice. Learning was impaired, yet not completely prevented. Histological
   studies showed a reduction in the cell number and the size of the
   anterior interpositus nucleus. When the anterior interpositus nucleus
   was lesioned bilaterally, eyeblink conditioning was completely
   prevented. The important roles of both cerebellar cortex and AIP nucleus

Abstract = {{The onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is often accompanied by changes in
   emotion, motivation, and goal-directed behavior. The production of
   beta-amyloid is thought to be a major and early contributor to the
   pathogenesis of AD. The present study tested the hypothesis that amyloid
   pathology present in the amygdala, frontal cortex, and hippocampus of
   Tg2576 mice would disrupt the development of instrumental- and/or
   Pavlovian-outcome associations. The results showed that both
   instrumental- and Pavlovian-conditioned behaviors were sensitive to
   outcome devaluation (Experiments 1 \& 2) and that Pavlovian cues
   influenced goal-directed actions associated with the same outcome
   (Experiment 2) in Tg2576 mice. In contrast, context mediated
   Pavlovian-conditioned behaviors in aged (Experiment 3a) but not young
   (Experiment 3b) Tg2576 mice were insensitive to outcome devaluation.
   Aged Tg2576, nevertheless, successfully acquired a simple context
   discrimination at the same rate as control mice. We conclude that
   amyloid pathology in aged Tg2576 mice may specifically disrupt
   context-outcome associations supported by the hippocampus and/or its
   interaction with the amygdala.}},

Abstract = {{When guinea pig pups are isolated for a few hours in a novel
   environment, they exhibit a distinctive passive behavioral response that
   appears to be mediated by proinflammatory activity. Recently, we
   observed that pups separated on two consecutive days show an enhanced
   (sensitized) passive response on the second day. In Experiment 1, pups
   receiving intracerebroventricular infusion of 50 ng of the
   anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 prior to a first separation
   failed to show a sensitized behavioral response to separation the next
   day. In Experiment 2, pups separated on Days 1 and 2, or just 2, showed
   an increase in passive responding during separation on Day 5. Pups
   injected with the bacterial antigen lipopolysacchride (LPS; 75 mu g/kg
   body weight, intraperitoneal) prior to separation on Day 1 showed an
   increase in passive behavior several days later not shown by pups
   injected with saline prior to Day 1 separation. However, injection of
   LPS without separation on the first day did not enhance responding
   during an initial separation on the second day. These results suggest
   that immune activation is necessary, but not sufficient, to account for
   the sensitization of passive behavior of isolated guinea pig pups the
   following day, that boosting proinflammatory activity during an initial
   separation may promote sensitization several days later, and that the
   sensitized response persists for at least several days.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal defense (offspring protection) is a critical and highly
   conserved component of maternal care in mammalian systems that involves
   dramatic shifts in a female's behavioral response to social cues.
   Numerous changes occur in neuronal signaling and connectivity in the
   postpartum female, including decreases in norepinephrine (NE) signaling
   in subregions of the CNS. In this study using a strain of mice selected
   for maternal defense, we examined whether possible changes in NE
   signaling in the lateral septum (LS) could facilitate expression of
   maternal aggression. In separate studies that utilized a repeated
   measures design, mice were tested for maternal defense following
   intra-LS injections of either the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist
   isoproterenol (10 mu g or 30 mu g) or vehicle (Experiment 1), the
   beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol (2 mu g) or vehicle
   (Experiment 2), or the beta 1-receptor antagonist, atenolol (Experiment
   3). Mice were also evaluated for light dark performance and pup
   retrieval. Thirty micrograms of the agonist isoproterenol significantly
   decreased number of attacks and time aggressive relative to vehicle
   without affecting pup retrieval or light dark box performance. In
   contrast, the antagonist propranolol significantly increased maternal
   aggression (lowered latency to attack and increased total attack time)
   without altering light dark box test. The beta 1-specific antagonist,
   atenolol, significantly decreased latency to attack (1 mu g vs. vehicle)
   without altering other measures. Although the findings were identified
   in a unique strain of mice, the results of these studies support the
   hypothesis that changes in NE signaling in LS during the postpartum
   period contribute to the expression of offspring protection.}},

Abstract = {{The sexually active female rat solicits the male to approach for
   copulation, while the maternal dam displays aggression to expel him from
   the nest, suggesting that both behaviors are mutually exclusive.
   However, the rat has a postpartum estrus during which she is sexual and
   maternally motivated. Can she perceive the male as attractive and
   aversive, soliciting and attacking him at the same time? This study
   shows that postpartum estrous females exhibit a merge of sexual and
   maternal aggressive responses toward male intruders in the home cage.
   The concurrent expression of these behaviors did not affect their
   intensities, although the stimulation of maternal behavior increased
   maternal aggression without modifying sexual solicitation. These results
   indicate that the postpartum estrous rat can optimally express two
   opposite and independently regulated motivations, and that the male can
   be perceived as an ambivalent stimulus.}},

Abstract = {{In the Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) glutamate activity has been
   implicated in the modulation of adolescent anabolic-androgenic steroid
   (AAS)-induced aggression. The current study investigated the time course
   of adolescent AAS-induced neurodevelopmental and withdrawal effects on
   the glutamatergic system and examined whether these changes paralleled
   those of adolescent AAS-induced aggression. Glutamate activity in brain
   areas comprising the aggression circuit in hamsters and aggression
   levels were examined following 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks of AAS treatment or
   I, 2, 3, and 4 weeks following the cessation of AAS exposure. In these
   studies glutamate activity was examined using vesicular glutamate
   transporter 2 (VGLUT2). The onset of aggression was observed following 2
   weeks exposure to AAS and continued to increase showing maximal
   aggression levels after 4 weeks of AAS treatment. This aggressive
   phenotype was detected after 2 weeks of withdrawal from AAS. The
   time-course of AAS-induced changes in latero-anterior hypothalamus
   (LAH)-VGLUT2 closely paralleled increases in aggression. Increases in
   LAH-VGLUT2 were first detected in animals exposed to AAS for 2 weeks and
   were maintained up to 3 weeks following the cessation of AAS treatment.
   AAS treatment also produced developmental and long-term alterations in
   VGLUT2 expression within other aggression areas. However, AAS-induced
   changes in glutamate activity within these regions did not coincide with
   changes in aggression. Together, these data indicate that adolescent AAS
   treatment leads to alterations in the glutamatergic system in brain
   areas implicated in aggression control, yet only alterations in
   LAH-glutamate parallel the time course of AAS-induced changes in the
   aggressive phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{Rho-kinase (ROCK) is a downstream effector of RhoA, which has been
   associated with growth cone collapse and retraction in neurons. ROCK
   inhibition has been shown to protect against ischemic damage, thereby
   improving short-term collateral flow, inhibiting platelet aggregation,
   leukocyte adhesion, and preventing neuronal death. However, little is
   known about the long-term effects of ROCK inhibition on behavior and
   neuroprotection. The consequence of ROCK inhibition on ischemic rats'
   learning and spatial memory after 30 days of intracerebroventricular
   treatment was evaluated. It was found that Y27632 (ROCK inhibitor)
   reduced neurodegenerative markers, such as Fluoro-Jade, PHF (paired
   helicoidal filaments) immunoreactivity, and p25 protein levels, in the
   hippocampus of ischemic animals and improved learning and spatial memory
   tasks. However, Y27632 alone impaired sham animals' long-term memory.
   These findings demonstrated the beneficial impact of ROCK inhibition on
   tauopathy and altered p25 protein levels following global cerebral
   ischemia.}},

Title = {{Discrimination Learning and Attentional Set Formation in a Mouse Model

Volume = {{125}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{473-479}},

Abstract = {{Fragile X Syndrome is the most prevalent genetic cause of mental
   retardation. Selective deficits in executive function, including
   inhibitory control and attention, are core features of the disorder. In
   humans, Fragile X results from a trinucleotide repeat in the Fmr1 gene
   that renders it functionally silent and has been modeled in mice by
   targeted deletion of the Fmr1 gene. Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice recapitulate
   many features of Fragile X syndrome, but evidence for deficits in
   executive function is inconsistent. To address this issue, we trained
   wild-type and Fmr1 KO mice on an experimental paradigm that assesses
   attentional set-shifting. Mice learned to discriminate between stimuli
   differing in two of three perceptual dimensions. Successful
   discrimination required attending only to the relevant dimension, while
   ignoring irrelevant dimensions. Mice were trained on three
   discriminations in the same perceptual dimension, each followed by a
   reversal. This procedure normally results in the formation of an
   attentional set to the relevant dimension. Mice were then required to
   shift attention and discriminate based on a previously irrelevant
   perceptual dimension. Wild-type mice exhibited the increase in trials to
   criterion expected when shifting attention from one perceptual dimension
   to another. In contrast, the Fmr1 KO group failed to show the expected
   increase, suggesting impairment in forming an attentional set. Fmr1 KO
   mice also exhibited a general impairment in learning discriminations and
   reversals. This is the first demonstration that Fmr1 KO mice show a
   deficit in attentional set formation.}},

Abstract = {{Neurophysiological and imaging studies suggest that the inferior frontal
   cortex (IFC) implements a mechanism that matches perceived actions to
   one's motor representation of similar actions (mirror mechanism) and
   recent lesion studies have also established that IFC is critical for

   perception requires activation within the same populations of IFC
   neurons involved in action execution is lacking. In this issue, Cattaneo
   and colleagues provide the first direct evidence that mirror mechanisms
   in IFC influence action perception. We discuss the implications of these
   findings for the understanding of the functional role of mirror

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Activation in frontopolar cortex (FPC; BA 10) has been associated both
   with attending to mental states and with integrating multiple mental
   relations. However, few previous studies have manipulated both of these
   cognitive processes, precluding a clear functional distinction among
   regions within FPC. To address this issue, we developed an fMRI task
   that combined mentalizing and relational integration processes.
   Participants saw blocks of single words and performed one of three
   judgments: how pleasant or unpleasant they found each word (Self
   condition), how a specific friend would evaluate the pleasantness of the
   word (Other condition), or the difference between their own pleasantness
   judgment and that of their friend (Relational condition). We found that
   medial FPC was modulated by Other relative to Self judgments, consistent
   with a role in mentalizing. Lateral FPC was significantly activated
   during Relational compared to Self judgements, suggesting that this
   region is particularly involved in relational integration. The results
   point to a strong functional dissociation between medial and lateral
   FPC. In addition, the data demonstrate a role for lateral FPC in the
   social domain, provided that the task requires the integration of one's
   preferences with those of others.}},

Abstract = {{A functional variant of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) has
   been associated with increased risk for major depression in the context
   of stress. In attempting to understand the mechanisms underlying this
   relation, we tested the hypothesis that 5-HTTLPR genotype affects the
   speed with which amygdala is recruited during emotional processing in
   young girls with no history of psychiatric disorder. We used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging to compare the rise time to peak amygdala
   activation in 5-HTTLPR short-allele carriers and long-allele homozygotes
   during enhancement of sad mood. Relative to long-allele homozygotes,
   participants with at least one copy of the 5-HTTLPR short allele showed
   both stronger and earlier activation in left amygdala as they increased
   a sad mood state. Individuals carrying the short allele appear to
   exhibit a neural `readiness' to engage and enhance negative affect.
   Future research should examine how exposure to negative life events and
   more chronic sadness modify the time course of amygdala activity during
   the experience of negative emotion.}},

Abstract = {{Ostracism arouses negative affect. However, little is known about
   variables that influence the intensity of these negative affective
   responses. Two studies fill this void by incorporating work on approach-
   and withdrawal-related emotional states and their associated cortical
   activations. Study 1 found that following ostracism anger related
   directly to relative left frontal cortical activation. Study 2 used
   unilateral hand contractions to manipulate frontal cortical activity
   prior to an ostracizing event. Right-hand contractions, compared to
   left-hand contractions, caused greater relative left frontal cortical
   activation during the hand contractions as well as ostracism. Also,
   right-hand contractions caused more self-reported anger in response to
   being ostracized. Within-condition correlations revealed patterns of
   associations between ostracism-induced frontal asymmetry and emotive
   responses to ostracism consistent with Study 1. Taken together, these
   results suggest that asymmetrical frontal cortical activity is related
   to angry responses to ostracism, with greater relative left frontal
   cortical activity being associated with increased anger.}},

Abstract = {{Prior research has shown that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) plays an

   have proposed that the OFC serves a common currency function, allowing
   for the direct comparison of different types of perceptual stimuli (e.g.
   food, drink, money). The present study was designed to extend this
   research and investigate whether these same regions of OFC that have
   been identified in previous research are involved in evaluating imagined
   stimuli. Specifically, we asked participants to draw on prior
   attitudinal knowledge to generate internal representations of liked and
   disliked exemplars from different categories during functional magnetic
   resonance imaging. The results of this study support the idea that
   imagined stimuli (regardless of stimulus category) are evaluated in the
   OFC using a common system that has been identified in previous research

   suggested to be related to more sensitive parenting, whereas depressive
   symptoms may affect sensitivity negatively. We examined the role of OXTR
   and the influence of depressive symptoms in explaining differences in
   physiological reactivity to infant crying. Heart rate responses of 40
   healthy females without children (age 19-47 years, randomly selected
   half of twin pairs) were measured during the presentation of three
   episodes of infant cry sounds. Participants with the presumably more
   efficient variant of the oxytonergic system gene (OXTR GG) had more
   pronounced physiological reactivity to repeated cry sounds, except when
   they showed more symptoms of depression. Results were replicated in the
   second half of the twin sample. This is the first study to suggest
   effects of OXTR genotype on physiological reactivity to infant crying.
   Depressive symptoms may however suppress the effect of the OXTR GG
   genotype.}},

Abstract = {{Neurons firing both during self and other's motor behavior (mirror
   neurons) have been described in the brain of vertebrates including
   humans. The activation of somatic motor programs driven by perceived
   behavior has been taken as evidence for mirror neurons' contribution to
   cognition. The inverse relation, that is the influence of motor behavior
   on perception, is needed for demonstrating the long-hypothesized causal
   role of mirror neurons in action understanding. We provide here
   conclusive behavioral and neurophysiological evidence for that causal
   role by means of cross-modal adaptation coupled with a novel
   transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-adaptation paradigm. Blindfolded
   repeated motor performance of an object-directed action (push or pull)
   induced in healthy participants a strong visual after-effect when
   categorizing others' actions, as a result of motor-to-visual adaptation
   of visuo-motor neurons. TMS over the ventral premotor cortex, but not
   over the primary motor cortex, suppressed the after-effect, thus
   localizing the population of adapted visuo-motor neurons in the premotor
   cortex. These data are exquisitely consistent in humans with the
   existence of premotor mirror neurons that have access to the action
   meaning. We also show that controlled manipulation of the firing
   properties of this neural population produces strong predictable changes
   in the way we categorize others' actions.}},

Abstract = {{Static pictures of emotional facial expressions have been found to
   activate brain structures involved in the processing of emotional
   stimuli. However, in everyday live, emotional expressions are changing
   rapidly, and the processing of the onset vs the offset of the very same
   emotional expression might rely on different brain networks, presumably
   leading to different behavioral and physiological reactions (e.g.
   approach or avoidance). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging,
   this was examined by presenting video clips depicting onsets and offsets
   of happy and angry facial expressions. Subjective valence and threat
   ratings clearly depended on the direction of change. Blood oxygen level
   dependent responses indicate both reward- and threat-related activations
   for the offset of angry expressions. Comparing onsets and offsets, angry
   offsets were associated with stronger ventral striatum activation than
   angry onsets. Additionally, the offset of happy and the onset of angry
   expressions showed strong common activity in the lateral orbitofrontal
   cortex bilaterally, the left amygdala and the left insula, whereas the
   onset of happy and the offset of angry expressions induced significant
   activation in the left dorsal striatum. In sum, the results confirm
   different activity in motivation-related brain areas in response to the
   onset and offset of the same emotional expression and highlight the
   importance of temporal characteristics of facial expressions for social
   communication.}},

Abstract = {{The human amygdalae are involved in processing visual information about
   the eyes within faces, and play an essential role in the use of
   information from the eye region of the face in order to judge emotional
   expressions, as well as in directing gaze to the eyes in conversations
   with real people. However, the roles played here by the left and right
   amygdala individually remain unknown. Here we investigated this question
   by applying the `Bubbles' method, which asks viewers to discriminate
   facial emotions from randomly sampled small regions of a face, to 23
   neurological participants with focal, unilateral amygdala damage (10 to
   the right amygdala). We found a statistically significant asymmetry in
   the use of eye information when comparing those with unilateral left
   lesions to those with unilateral right lesions, specifically during
   emotion judgments. The findings have implications for the amygdala's
   role in emotion recognition and gaze direction during face processing.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperation among genetically unrelated individuals is a fundamental
   aspect of society, but it has been a longstanding puzzle in biological
   and social sciences. Recently, theoretical studies in biology and
   economics showed that conditional cooperation-cooperating only with
   those who have exhibited cooperative behavior-can spread over a society.
   Furthermore, experimental studies in psychology demonstrated that people
   are actually conditional cooperators. In this study, we used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neural system underlying
   conditional cooperation by scanning participants during interaction with
   cooperative, neutral and non-cooperative opponents in prisoner's dilemma
   games. The results showed that: (i) participants cooperated more
   frequently with both cooperative and neutral opponents than with
   non-cooperative opponents; and (ii) a brain area related to cognitive
   inhibition of pre-potent responses (right dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex) showed greater activation, especially when participants
   confronted non-cooperative opponents. Consequently, we suggest that
   cognitive inhibition of the motivation to cooperate with non-cooperators
   drives the conditional behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and semantic
   dementia (SD) are neurodegenerative diseases that differ in their
   socioemotional presentations. Mutual gaze (i.e. when two individuals
   make eye contact) is a building block of social behavior that may be
   differentially affected by these diseases. We studied 13 AD patients, 11
   FTD patients, 9 SD patients and 22 normal controls as they engaged in
   conversations with partners about relationship conflicts. Physiological
   reactivity was monitored during the conversations and trained raters
   coded mutual gaze from videotaped recordings. Results indicated that
   mutual gaze was preserved in AD couples. Mutual gaze was diminished in
   FTD couples while SD couples showed evidence of greater mutual gaze. SD
   couples also showed lower physiological reactivity compared to controls.
   Across patient groups, reduced mutual gaze was associated with greater
   behavioral disturbance as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory,
   especially on the disinhibition and apathy subscales. These results
   point to subtle differences between the three types of dementia in the
   social realm that help to illuminate the nature of the disease process
   and could aid in differential diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{Facial expressions can trigger emotions: when we smile we feel happy,
   when we frown we feel sad. However, the mimicry literature also shows
   that we feel happy when our interaction partner behaves the way we do.
   Thus what happens if we express our sadness and we perceive somebody who
   is imitating us? In the current study, participants were presented with
   either happy or sad faces, while expressing one of these emotions
   themselves. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure
   neural responses on trials where the observed emotion was either
   congruent or incongruent with the expressed emotion. Our results
   indicate that being in a congruent emotional state, irrespective of the
   emotion, activates the medial orbitofrontal cortex and ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex, brain areas that have been associated with positive
   feelings and reward processing. However, incongruent emotional states
   activated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as well as posterior
   superior temporal gyrus/sulcus, both playing a role in conflict
   processing.}},

Abstract = {{Emotion theory emphasizes the distinction between social vs non-social
   emotional-processing (E-P) although few functional neuroimaging studies
   have examined whether the neural systems that mediate social vs
   non-social E-P are similar or distinct. The present fMRI study of
   script-driven imagery in 20 women demonstrates that social E-P,
   independent of valence, more strongly recruits brain regions involved in
   social- and self-referential processing, specifically the dorsomedial
   prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate/precuneus, bilateral temporal
   poles, bilateral temporoparietal junction and right amygdala. Functional
   response within brain regions involved in E-P was also significantly
   more pronounced during negatively relative to positively valenced E-P.
   Finally, the effect for social E-P was increased for positive relative
   to negative stimuli in many of these same regions. Future research
   directions for social and affective neuroscience are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Older adults, compared to younger adults, focus on emotional well-being.
   While the lifespan trajectory of emotional processing and its regulation
   has been characterized behaviorally, few studies have investigated the
   underlying neural mechanisms. Here, older adults (range: 59-73 years)
   and younger adults (range: 19-33 years) participated in a cognitive
   reappraisal task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   scanning. On each trial, participants viewed positive, negative or
   neutral pictures and either naturally experienced the image
   ('Experience' condition) or attempted to detach themselves from the
   image ('Reappraise' condition). Across both age groups, cognitive
   reappraisal activated prefrontal regions similar to those reported in
   prior studies of emotion regulation, while emotional experience
   activated the bilateral amygdala. Psychophysiological interaction
   analyses revealed that the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and
   amygdala demonstrated greater inverse connectivity during the
   `Reappraise' condition relative to the `Experience' condition. The only
   regions exhibiting significant age differences were the left IFG and the
   left superior temporal gyrus, for which greater regulation-related
   activation was observed in younger adults. Controlling for age,
   increased performance on measures of cognition predicted greater
   regulation-related decreases in amygdala activation. Thus, while older
   and younger adults use similar brain structures for emotion regulation
   and experience, the functional efficacy of those structures depends on
   underlying cognitive ability.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on aging and emotion suggest an increase in reported positive
   affect, a processing bias of positive over negative information, as well
   as increasingly adaptive regulation in response to negative events with
   advancing age. These findings imply that older individuals evaluate
   information differently, resulting in lowered reactivity to, and/or
   faster recovery from, negative information, while maintaining more
   positive responding to positive information. We examined this hypothesis
   in an ongoing study on Midlife in the US (MIDUS II) where emotional
   reactivity and recovery were assessed in a large number of respondents
   (N = 159) from a wide age range (36-84 years). We recorded eye-blink
   startle magnitudes and corrugator activity during and after the
   presentation of positive, neutral and negative pictures. The most robust
   age effect was found in response to neutral stimuli, where increasing
   age is associated with a decreased corrugator and eyeblink startle
   response to neutral stimuli. These data suggest that an age-related
   positivity effect does not essentially alter the response to
   emotion-laden information, but is reflected in a more positive
   interpretation of affectively ambiguous information. Furthermore, older
   women showed reduced corrugator recovery from negative pictures relative
   to the younger women and men, suggesting that an age-related
   prioritization of well-being is not necessarily reflected in adaptive
   regulation of negative affect.}},

Abstract = {{Although previous research suggests that overall emotional reactivity
   does not change with normal aging, it is possible that different
   emotions follow different developmental courses. We examined emotional
   reactivity to films selected to elicit sadness, disgust, and a neutral
   state in young, middle-aged and older adults (total N = 222). Physiology
   and expressive behavior were measured continuously and reports of
   subjective emotional experience were obtained following each film.
   Results indicated that older adults reported greater sadness in response
   to all films and greater physiological responses to the sadness film
   than did the younger age groups. There were no age differences found in
   self-reported disgust or in behavioral expressions of sadness or disgust
   in response to any film. The age differences that were found were
   maintained even after controlling for pre-film self-reported sadness and
   for personal experiences of loss. These findings support the notion that
   sadness reactivity is heightened with age.}},

Abstract = {{Financial planning decisionss are fundamentally affective in nature;
   they are decisions related to money, longevity and quality of life. Over
   the next several decades people will be increasingly responsible for
   managing their own assets and investments, and they will be subject to
   the affective influences on active, personal decision-making. Many of
   these crucial decisions are made and revised across the lifespan,
   including when to buy or sell a home, how to save for childrens'
   education, how to manage healthcare costs, when to retire, how much to
   save for retirement and how to allocate retirement funds. As average
   life expectancy increases, many retirees will be faced with inadequate
   savings to live comfortably until the end of their lives. In the current
   article, we examine the problems of and potential solutions to
   inadequate financial planning through the lens of affective science,
   with an emphasis on how brain-based changes in affective processing with
   age might contribute to the challenge of financial planning.}},

Abstract = {{When making decisions, individuals must often compensate for cognitive
   limitations, particularly in the face of advanced age. Recent findings
   suggest that age-related variability in striatal activity may increase
   financial risk-taking mistakes in older adults. In two studies, we
   sought to further characterize neural contributions to optimal financial
   risk taking and to determine whether decision aids could improve
   financial risk taking. In Study 1, neuroimaging analyses revealed that
   individuals whose mesolimbic activation correlated with the expected
   value estimates of a rational actor made more optimal financial
   decisions. In Study 2, presentation of expected value information
   improved decision making in both younger and older adults, but the
   addition of a distracting secondary task had little impact on decision
   quality. Remarkably, provision of expected value information improved
   the performance of older adults to match that of younger adults at
   baseline. These findings are consistent with the notion that mesolimbic
   circuits play a critical role in optimal choice, and imply that
   providing simplified information about expected value may improve
   financial risk taking across the adult life span.}},

Abstract = {{People have present-biased preferences: they choose more impatiently

   G., Cohen, J.D. (2004). Separate neural systems value immediate and
   delayed monetary rewards. Science, 306, 503.], we find that areas in the
   dopaminergic reward system show greater activation when a binary choice
   set includes both an immediate reward and a delayed reward in contrast
   to activation measured when the binary choice set contains only delayed
   rewards. The presence of an immediate reward in the choice set elevates
   activation of the ventral striatum, pregenual anterior cingulate cortex
   and anterior medial prefrontal cortex. These dopaminergic reward areas
   are also responsive to the identity of the recipient of the reward. Even
   an immediate reward does not activate these dopaminergic regions when
   the decision is being made for another person. Our results support the
   hypotheses that participants show less affective engagement (i) when

Abstract = {{There are complex reciprocal relationships between health and social,
   emotional and economic factors in aging populations. Social and
   affective neurosciences are rapidly developing an understanding of the
   mechanisms underlying these phenomena using sophisticated behavioural,
   neuroimaging and psychophysiological methods. These techniques are often
   complex and expensive, so are generally used in relatively small
   selected samples rather than in large-scale cohort studies. However, an
   understanding of the significance of these processes in health and
   well-being depends on integrating findings from social and affective
   neuroscience into population-level studies. The aim of this article is
   to describe how a population perspective on the determinants of health
   and well-being in old age articulates with the agenda of social,
   affective and economic neuroscience, particularly through the
   application of psychosocial biomarker research. Social and affective
   neuroscience and epidemiological approaches provide complementary
   research strategies for understanding the mechanisms linking social,
   emotional and economic factors with health risk. This will be
   illustrated primarily from findings from two studies conducted at
   University College London, the Whitehall II Study and the English
   Longitudinal Study of Ageing.}},

Abstract = {{Ostracism is ubiquitous across the lifespan. From social exclusion on
   the playground, to romantic rejection, to workplace expulsion, to social
   disregard for the aged, ostracism threatens a fundamental human need to
   belong that reflexively elicits social pain and sadness. Older adults
   may be particularly vulnerable to ostracism because of loss of network
   members and meaningful societal roles. On the other hand, socioemotional
   selectivity theory suggests that older adults may be less impacted by
   ostracism because of an age-related positivity bias. We examined these
   hypotheses in two independent studies, and tested mechanisms that may
   account for age differences in the affective experience of ostracism. A
   study of 18- to 86-year-old participants in the Time-Sharing Experiments
   for the Social Sciences program showed an age-related decrease in the
   impact of ostracism on needs satisfaction and negative affectivity. A
   study of 53- to 71-year-old participants in the Chicago Health, Aging,
   and Social Relations Study (CHASRS) showed that ostracism diminished
   positive affectivity in younger (<60 years) but not older adults. Age
   group differences in response to ostracism were consistent with the
   positivity bias hypothesis, were partly explained by age differences in
   the impact of physical pain, but were not explained by autonomic nervous
   system activity, computer experience, or intimate social loss or
   stressful life experiences.}},

   Reports of both very affectionate and very unaffectionate parental
   relations in childhood were associated with flatter diurnal rhythms,
   suggesting potential dysregulation of the HPA axis at both extremes of

Abstract = {{In the 1960s, Mischel and colleagues developed a simple `marshmallow
   test' to measure preschoolers' ability to delay gratification. In
   numerous follow-up studies over 40 years, this `test' proved to have
   surprisingly significant predictive validity for consequential social,
   cognitive and mental health outcomes over the life course. In this
   article, we review key findings from the longitudinal work and from
   earlier delay-of-gratification experiments examining the cognitive
   appraisal and attention control strategies that underlie this ability.
   Further, we outline a set of hypotheses that emerge from the
   intersection of these findings with research on `cognitive control'
   mechanisms and their neural bases. We discuss implications of these
   hypotheses for decomposing the phenomena of `willpower' and the lifelong
   individual differences in self-regulatory ability that were identified
   in the earlier research and that are currently being pursued.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the genetic and neuroendocrine basis of the mother-infant
   bond is critical to understanding mammalian affiliation and attachment.
   Functionally similar nonsynonymous mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1) SNPs have
   arisen and been maintained in humans (A118G) and rhesus macaques Macaca
   mulatta (C77G). In rhesus macaques, variation in OPRM1 predicts
   individual differences in infant affiliation for mothers. Specifically,
   infants carrying the G allele show increased distress on separation from
   their mothers, and spend more time with them upon reunion, than
   individuals homozygous for the C allele. In humans, individuals
   possessing the G allele report higher perceptions of emotional pain on
   receiving rejection by social partners. We studied maternal behavior
   over the course of a year among free-ranging female rhesus macaques on
   Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico. We then trapped females and collected blood
   samples from which we assessed OPRM1 genotype; we also collected
   cerebrospinal fluid samples from which we measured oxytocin (OT) levels.
   We show that females possessing the G allele restrain their infants more
   (i.e., prevent infants from separating from them by pulling them back)
   than females homozygous for the C allele. Females possessing the G
   allele also show higher OT levels when lactating, and lower OT levels
   when neither lactating nor pregnant, than females homozygous for the C
   allele. This is the first study to demonstrate an association between
   OPRM1 genotype and maternal attachment for infants, and is one of the
   first studies of any free-ranging primate population to link functional
   genetic variation to behavior via potentially related neuroendocrine
   mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Earlier studies in monkeys have reported mild impairment in recognition
   memory after nonselective neonatal hippocampal lesions. To assess
   whether the memory impairment could have resulted from damage to
   cortical areas adjacent to the hippocampus, we tested adult monkeys with
   neonatal focal hippocampal lesions and sham-operated controls in three
   recognition tasks: delayed nonmatching-to-sample, object memory span,
   and spatial memory span. Further, to rule out that normal performance on
   these tasks may relate to functional sparing following neonatal
   hippocampal lesions, we tested adult monkeys that had received the same
   focal hippocampal lesions in adulthood and their controls in the same
   three memory tasks. Both early and late onset focal hippocampal damage
   did not alter performance on any of the three tasks, suggesting that
   damage to cortical areas adjacent to the hippocampus was likely
   responsible for the recognition impairment reported by the earlier
   studies. In addition, given that animals with early and late onset
   hippocampal lesions showed object and spatial recognition impairment
   when tested in a visual paired comparison task, the data suggest that
   not all object and spatial recognition tasks are solved by
   hippocampal-dependent memory processes. The current data may not only
   help explain the neural substrate for the partial recognition memory
   impairment reported in cases of developmental amnesia, but they are also
   clinically relevant given that the object and spatial memory tasks used
   in monkeys are often translated to investigate memory functions in
   several populations of human infants and children in which dysfunction
   of the hippocampus is suspected.}},

Abstract = {{Despite its importance for development, relatively little is known about
   how allelic variation interacts with both pre- and postnatal stress. We
   examined the interaction between serotonin transporter (5-HTT) genotype,
   prenatal and postnatal stress on glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA
   expression, corticosteroid stress responses, and behavior in adult male
   rats. Prenatal stress involved a daily restraint of pregnant dams from
   gestational Day 10-21. Postnatal stress involved raising pups after
   parturition either by their mothers (MR) or in the artificial rearing
   (AR) paradigm, with or without additional ``licking-like{''} stroking
   stimulation. 5-HTT genotype, hippocampal GR mRNA level, corticosteroid
   stress response, and behaviors including startle response, prepulse
   inhibition (PPI), and locomotor activity were measured in adult male rat
   offspring. We found significant genotype by prenatal stress interactions
   for hippocampal GR mRNA levels and for the corticosterone stress
   responses in adulthood. In contrast, behavioral endpoints tended to be
   more clearly affected by an interaction between genotype and postnatal
   environment. These findings suggest that allelic variation in the 5-HTT
   gene interacts with the prenatal environment to affect the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis physiology and the postnatal
   environment to affect behavior. These results are the first to indicate
   a role for genetic variation in the 5-HTT gene in physiology and
   behavior in the rat.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the effect of postnatal tactile stimulation (TS)
   on juvenile behavior, adult amphetamine (AMPH) sensitization, and the
   interaction of IS and AMPH on prefrontal cortical (PFC) thickness and
   striatum size. Pups received TS by stroking daily with a feather duster
   from birth till weaning and were tested, as juveniles, in behavioral
   tasks including open field locomotion, elevated maze, novel object
   recognition, and play fighting behavior. Development and persistence of
   drug-induced behavioral sensitization was tested by chronic AMPH
   administration and challenge, respectively. PFC thickness and striatum
   size were assessed from serial brain sections. The findings showed that
   TS rats spent less time with novel objects on first exposure but open
   field locomotion and elevated plus maze tasks were not affected
   substantially. TS reduced the frequency of play fighting and enhanced
   evasion in response to a playful attack, but only in males. The
   probability of complete rotation defense, leading to a supine posture
   during play, was reduced in both sexes. AMPH administration resulted in
   gradual increase in behavioral sensitization that persisted at least for
   2 weeks. However, TS rats exhibited attenuated AMPH sensitization
   compared to sex-matched controls. Neuroanatomically. AMPH reduced the
   PFC thickness in control females but enlarged the posterior striatum in
   control males. TS experience blocked these effects. In summary, TS
   during development modulated the response to novel objects and altered
   social behaviors and attenuated AMPH-induced behavioral sensitization by
   preventing drug-induced structural alteration in the PFC and the
   striatum, brain regions implicated in drug abuse.}},

Abstract = {{Impairment of nitric oxide (NO) production, ryanodine receptor (RyR)
   calcium channel function and adrenoceptor activation have been found to
   prevent the formation of the long-term memory stage in young chicks
   trained on a single-trial discrimination avoidance task. The current
   study investigated whether these three activities were linked, and if
   so, the sequence of activation. Young chicks were trained using either a
   strongly or weakly reinforced variant of the single-trial discrimination
   avoidance task, yielding either a persistent or labile memory trace,
   respectively. Following strongly reinforced training, retention loss
   induced by a RyR inhibitor was prevented by a NO donor or noradrenaline
   (NA). A RyR agonist also prevented retention loss induced by either NO
   synthase or beta(1+2)-adrenoceptor inhibition. These findings were
   interpreted to reflect the capacity of NO, RyR-dependent calcium release
   and NA to modulate memory by preventing retention loss. A second set of
   studies used weakly reinforced training. Although the administration of
   a RyR agonist promoted long-term memory formation, this facilitation was
   compromised in the presence of a beta(1+2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, but
   not a NO synthase inhibitor. Similarly, the inhibition of RyRs
   interfered with the facilitation of retention induced by a NO donor, but
   not NA. These differential findings with weakly reinforced training
   suggest that NO facilitates memory formation through mechanisms
   involving RyR-dependent calcium release. The findings also indicate that
   RyRs may promote memory formation through noradrenergic activation of
   beta(2)-adrenoceptors. This study demonstrates an intricate role for
   RyRs underlying memory formation.}},

Abstract = {{Exposing rats to differential rearing conditions during early
   postweaning development has been shown to produce changes in a number of
   behaviors displayed during adulthood. The purpose of the present studies
   was to investigate whether rearing alcohol-preferring (P) and
   nonpreferring (NP) rats in an environmental enrichment condition (EC), a
   social condition (SC), or an impoverished condition (IC) would
   differentially affect self-administration of 10\% ethanol. In Experiment
   1, rats were tested for consumption of 10\% ethanol in limited- and
   free-access tests. For Experiment 2, rats were trained to respond in an
   operant chamber for ethanol and then provided concurrent access to 10\%
   ethanol and water. Each solution was presented in a separate liquid
   dipper after meeting the schedule of reinforcement on distinct levers.
   After concurrent access tests, the water lever/dipper was inactivated
   and a progressive ratio (PR) schedule was initiated. Three successive
   solutions (10\% ethanol, 15\% ethanol, and 10\% sucrose) were tested
   under the PR. For P rats, rearing in an EC reduced ethanol consumption,
   preference, and motivation to obtain ethanol, relative to P rats reared
   in an IC. Thus, exposure to a novel environment immediately after
   weaning acted to decrease the reinforcing properties of ethanol in an
   animal model for alcoholism.}},

Abstract = {{Impulsivity is a defining characteristic of adolescence. Compared to
   adults, for example, adolescents engage in higher rates of drug and
   alcohol experimentation, risky sexual practices, and criminal activity.
   Such behavior may reflect reduced sensitivity to long-term consequences
   of behavior during adolescence. Recently, our lab has attempted to
   refine mouse procedures to study developmental trends in decision making
   in the laboratory. In the present experiment, we examined sensitivity to
   delayed rewards in C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) mice during adolescence
   and adulthood using an adaptation of a 2-week delay discounting
   procedure developed by Adriani and Laviola (2003). During training, mice
   could choose between a 20- or 100 mu l drop of milk delivered after a
   1-s delay. During testing. the delay to the large drop of milk was
   increased from 1 to 100 seconds. As the delay to the larger volume
   increased, preference shifted to the smaller, more immediate option. In
   adolescence, both strains showed similar shifts in preference. In
   contrast, adult B6 mice were less sensitive to increasing delays than
   were adult D2 mice, who continued to perform much as their adolescent
   counterparts. A subsequent resistance-to-extinction test ruled out the
   possibility that the slower change in the adult B6 mice was due to
   perseverative responding. The present findings suggest that B6 and D2
   strains may be differentially suited to uncovering the biological
   mechanism of short-term and long-term patterns of impulsive behavior.}},

   presented. A response on lever A was reinforced if t < 25 s, and a
   response on lever B was reinforced if r > 25 s. A second group was
   trained on a light-intensity discrimination procedure, in which a light
   of variable intensity, i (3.6-128.5 cd/m(2)) was presented for 25 s. A
   response on lever A was reinforced if i < 22 cd/m(2), and a response on
   lever B was reinforced if i > 22 cd/m(2). In Experiment 2, bisection
   procedures were used to assess temporal (200-800 ms, 22 cd/m(2)) and
   light-intensity (3.6-128.5 cd/m(2), 400 ms) discrimination. The increase
   in proportional choice of lever B as a function of stimulus duration or
   intensity conformed to a two-parameter logistic equation. Fos expression
   in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens was higher in rats
   performing temporal discrimination tasks than in those performing
   light-intensity discrimination tasks, indicating greater neuronal
   activation in these areas during temporal discrimination tasks. Fos
   expression in the dorsal striatum did not differ between rats performing
   temporal and light-intensity discrimination tasks. These results suggest
   that the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens are involved in
   temporal discrimination.}},

Abstract = {{While previous work has demonstrated that systemic dopamine
   manipulations can modulate temporal perception by altering the speed of
   internal clock processes, the neural site of this modulation remains
   unclear. Based on recent research suggesting that changes in incentive
   salience can alter the perception of time, as well as work showing that
   nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell dopamine (DA) levels modulate the
   incentive salience of discriminative stimuli that predict instrumental
   outcomes, we assessed whether microinjections of DA agents into the NAc
   shell would impact temporal perception. Rats were trained on either a
   10-s or 30-s temporal production procedure and received intra-NAc shell
   microinfusions of sulpiride, amphetamine, and saline. Results showed
   that NAc DA modulations had no effect on response timing, but intra-NAc
   shell sulpiride microinfusions significantly decreased response rates
   relative to saline and amphetamine. Our findings therefore suggest that
   neither NAc shell DA levels, nor the resultant changes in incentive
   salience signaled by this structure, impact temporal control.}},

Abstract = {{To examine sequential movement preparation, participants practiced

   used to probe the preparation process. For simple RI, we found increased

   1, which was minimized with practice. During startle trials, all
   movements were triggered at a short latency with similar consistency to
   control trials, suggesting full advance preparation of all movements.
   For choice RI, we also found increased premotor RI for control trials
   for the two component movement. As advance preparation could not occur,
   the startling stimulus did not trigger any of the movements. We
   hypothesized that complexity may relate to the neural commands needed to
   produce the movement, rather than a sequencing requirement.}},

Abstract = {{The feedback-related negativity (FRN), an event-related potential (ERP)
   component reflecting feedback processing in the anterior cingulate
   cortex (ACC), has consistently been found to be reduced in healthy
   aging, whereas behavioral findings regarding age-related changes in
   decision making and feedback-based learning are inconsistent. This study
   aimed to elucidate similarities and differences between healthy younger
   and older subjects in the processing of monetary performance feedback
   focusing on effects of reward expectancy. Eighteen younger and 20 older
   subjects completed a feedback learning task, in which a rule could be
   learned to predict the reward probabilities associated with particular
   stimuli. Older subjects showed evidence of slower learning than younger
   subjects. In both younger and older subjects, the amplitude difference
   between nonreward and reward in the FRN time window was larger for
   unexpected than expected outcomes, driven by modulations of negative
   feedback ERPs. Consistent with previous findings, the amplitude
   difference tended to be generally reduced in older subjects. P300
   amplitude was larger for reward than nonreward in both groups, and
   interactions between valence and probability indicated that only the
   P300 for reward was modulated by expectancy. Despite general changes of
   outcome-related ERPs in healthy aging, older subjects show evidence of
   preserved effects of expectancy on the processing of monetary feedback.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of executive load on working memory performance during sleep
   inertia after morning or afternoon naps were assessed using a mixed
   design with nap/wake as a between-subjects factor and morning/afternoon
   condition as a within-subject factor. Thirty-two healthy adults (mean
   22.5 +/- 3.0 years) attended two laboratory sessions after a night of
   restricted sleep (6 hrs), and at first visit, were randomly assigned to
   the Nap or Wake group. Working memory (n-back) and subjective workload
   were assessed approximately 5 and 25 minutes after 90-minute morning and
   afternoon nap opportunities and at the corresponding times in the Wake
   condition. Actigraphically assessed noctumal sleep duration, subjective
   sleepiness, and psychomotor vigilance performance before daytime
   assessments did not vary across conditions. Afternoon naps showed
   shorter EEG assessed sleep latencies, longer sleep duration, and more
   Slow Wave Sleep than morning naps. Working memory performance
   deteriorated, and subjective mental workload increased at higher
   executive loadings. After afternoon naps, participants performed less
   well on more executive-function intensive working memory tasks (i.e.,
   3-back), but waking and napping participants performed equally well on
   simpler tasks. After some 30 minutes of cognitive activity, there were
   no longer performance differences between the waking and napping groups.
   Subjective Task Difficulty and Mental Effort requirements were less
   affected by sleep inertia and dissociated from objective measures when
   participants had napped in the afternoon. We conclude that executive
   functions take longer to return to asymptotic performance after sleep
   than does performance of simpler tasks which are less reliant on
   executive functions.}},

Abstract = {{The powerful, long-lasting association between the rewarding effects of
   a drug and contextual cues associated with drug administration can be
   studied using conditioned place preference (CPP). The GABA(B) receptor
   agonist baclofen facilitates the extinction of morphine-induced CPP in
   mice. The current study extended this work by determining if baclofen
   could enhance the extinction of methamphetamine (Meth) CPP. CPP was
   established using a six-day conditioning protocol wherein Meth-pairings
   were alternated with saline-pairings. Rats were subsequently
   administered baclofen (2 mg/kg i.p. or vehicle) immediately after each
   daily forced extinction session, which consisted of a saline injection
   immediately prior to being placed into the previously Meth- or
   saline-paired chamber. One extinction training cycle, consisted of six
   once-daily forced extinction sessions, mimicking the alternating
   procedure established during conditioning, followed by a test for
   preference (Ext test). CPP persisted for at least four extinction cycles
   in vehicle-treated rats. In contrast, CPP was inhibited following a
   single extinction training cycle. These data indicate that Meth-induced
   CPP was resistant to extinction, but extinction training was rendered
   effective when the training was combined with baclofen. These findings
   converge with the prior demonstration of baclofen facilitating the
   extinction of morphine-induced CPP indicating that GABA(B) receptor
   actions are independent of the primary (unconditioned) stimulus (i.e.,
   the opiate or the stimulant) and likely reflect mechanisms engaged by
   extinction learning processes per se. Thus, baclofen administered in
   conjunction with extinction training may be of value for addiction
   therapy regardless of the class of drug being abused.}},

Abstract = {{Unmedicated schizophrenia patients exhibit deficits in prepulse
   inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response. Similar deficits can
   be induced in rodents via a variety of manipulations and these deficits
   can be reversed by antipsychotics. Brown Norway (BN) rats exhibit
   natural PPI deficits under certain parametric conditions. We treated BN
   rats with haloperidol or clozapine to determine if the BN rat is a
   useful animal model with predictive validity for the effects of
   antipsychotics. In addition, we also tested PD149163, a neurotensin-1
   receptor agonist, which has been shown to exhibit antipsychotic-like
   effects in several other animal models. BN rats received subcutaneous
   injections of either saline or one of two doses of haloperidol (0.5
   mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg), clozapine (7.5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg) or PD149163 (1.0
   mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg). PPI was measured in startle chambers 30 min after
   injection. Systemic clozapine and PD149163 but not haloperidol
   facilitated PPI in BN rats (p < .001). This drug response profile
   suggests that the BN rat may be useful for detecting atypical
   antipsychotics and antipsychotics with novel mechanisms of action. The
   results also add to the evidence suggesting that PD149163 may have
   antipsychotic properties.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term aerobic exercise improves cognition in both human and nonhuman
   animals and induces plastic changes in the central nervous system (CNS),
   including neurogenesis and angiogenesis. However, the early and
   immediate effects of exercise on the CNS have not been adequately
   explored. There is some evidence to suggest that exercise is initially
   challenging to the nervous system and that the plastic changes commonly
   associated with chronic exercise may result as adaptations to this
   challenge. The current experiment assessed levels of apoptosis,
   angiogenesis, and neurogenesis during the first week of an exercise
   regimen in the adult rat. The results indicate that exercise rapidly
   induces these processes in the hippocampus and cerebellum. The temporal
   pattern of these events suggests that voluntary exercise in the adult
   rat rapidly and transiently induces apoptosis, followed by angiogenesis.
   Neurogenesis is an immediate and independent consequence of exercise in
   the hippocampus that may require the additional metabolic support
   supplied by angiogenesis. This is the first report of CNS neuronal
   apoptosis as a consequence of exercise in the adult rat and suggests
   that this process is a potential mediator of rapid exercise-induced
   plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies in rats have shown that extinction occurring early in
   life is resistant to relapse and may represent the erasure of fear
   memories. In the present study we examined the effects of early life
   stress on extinction in the developing rat, which could have important
   implications for the treatment of anxiety disorders in those who have
   experienced early life stress. In the present study, we used
   maternal-separation on postnatal days (P) 2-14 as an early life
   stressor. On P17. maternally separated and standard-reared animals were
   trained to fear a noise associated with a footshock. The fear of this
   noise was then extinguished (through repeated nonreinforced noise
   presentations) on P18. Animals were tested for contextually mediated,
   stress-mediated, and GABA-mediated fear relapse the day after
   extinction. We found that young animals exposed to maternal-separation
   were more likely to exhibit context- and stress-mediated relapse after
   extinction than standard-reared animals (Experiments 1 and 2). Further,
   unlike standard-reared animals, maternally separated rats exhibited a
   return of fear when the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA was blocked at
   test (Experiment 3). These effects were not the result of maternal
   separation increasing rats' sensitivity to footshock (Experiment 5) and
   may in part be related to superior long-term memory for contexts in P17
   maternally separated rats (Experiment 4). Taken together, these results
   suggest that early life adversity may prepare young animals to respond
   more cautiously toward fear signals in their environment.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the vocalization and the thermogenic responses to cold
   during hypoxia in chicken hatchlings during the first postnatal day.
   Calls were quantified in number and sound characteristics (amplitude and
   frequency); the change in oxygen (O-2) consumption, measured by an
   open-flow methodology, represented thermogenesis. The cold challenge
   consisted of a decrease in ambient temperature (Ta) from similar to 39
   to 28 degrees C, in steps of 2 degrees C, or an acute exposure to
   similar to 28 degrees C, either in normoxia or hypoxia (10\% O-2).
   Hypoxia lowered thermogenesis and the critical Ta, suggesting a decrease
   in the set point for thermoregulation. The vocalization response to cold
   was rapid; did not progress with the duration or intensity of the cold
   stimulus; was similar in very young (< 8 hr old) and older (12-24 hr)
   hatchlings despite their differences in thermogenic capacity; and was
   essentially unaffected by hypoxia. We conclude that the hatchling's
   vocalization in the cold follows a stereotyped pattern not related to
   the thermogenic regulation of body temperature. The dissociation between
   vocalization and thermogenesis might carry some advantage in conditions
   of cold and hypoxia.}},

Abstract = {{In the separated arms conditioned cue preference (CCP) task rats are
   trained by confining them in one arm of an eight-arm radial maze with
   food and in another arm on the opposite side of the maze with no food on
   alternate days. After two such trials, rats prefer the food-paired arm
   when allowed to move freely between the two arms, neither of which
   contains food. However, if the rats are preexposed to the maze by
   exploring it without food before training, no preference is observed and
   at least 4 training trials are required to produce a CCP, suggesting
   that unreinforced preexposure to the maze latently inhibits acquisition.
   If this interpretation is correct, preexposure should reduce the size of
   the preference acquired with both 2 and 4 training trials. In Experiment
   1, this prediction was replicated for 2 training trials; however, with 4
   training trials, eliminating preexposure also eliminated the CCP. A
   previous finding that basolateral amygdala lesions impair the CCP with
   preexposure and 4 training trials was replicated in Experiment 2, but
   similar lesions had no effect on the CCP in nonpreexposed rats given 2
   training trials. In contrast, lesions of the central nucleus impaired
   the 2 training trial CCP but had no effect on the 4 training trial CCP.
   This double dissociation suggests that the BLA-mediated 4 training trial
   CCP may be due to learning about the reward features of the maze space,
   while the central-nucleus-mediated 2 training trial CCP may be due to a
   conditioned approach response.}},

Abstract = {{Poor self-control, lack of inhibition, and impulsivity contribute to the
   propensity of adolescents to engage in risky or dangerous behaviors.
   Brain regions (e.g., prefrontal cortex) involved in impulse-control,
   reward-processing, and decision-making continue to develop during
   adolescence, raising the possibility that an immature brain contributes
   to dangerous behavior during adolescence. However, very few validated
   animal behavioral models are available for behavioral neuroscientists to
   explore the relationship between brain development and behavior. To that
   end, a valid model must be conducted in the relatively brief window of
   adolescence and not use manipulations that potentially compromise
   development. The present experiments used three operant arrangements to
   assess whether adolescent rats differ from adults in measures of
   learning, behavioral inhibition, and impulsivity, within the
   aforementioned time frame without substantial food restriction. In
   Experiment 1, separate squads of rats were trained to lever-press and
   then transitioned to two types of extinction. Relative to their
   baselines, adolescent rats responded more during extinction than adults,
   suggesting that they were less sensitive to the abolishment of the
   reinforcement contingency. Experiment 2 demonstrated similar age-related
   differences during exposure to a differential reinforcement of low rates
   schedule, a test of behavioral inhibition. Lastly, in Experiment 3,
   adolescent's responding decreased more slowly than adults during
   exposure to a resetting delay of reinforcement schedule, suggesting
   impaired self-control. Results from these experiments suggest that
   adolescents exhibit impaired learning, behavioral inhibition and
   self-control, and in concert with recent reports, provide researchers
   with three behavioral models to more fully explore neurobiology of
   risk-taking behavior in adolescence.}},

Abstract = {{Prior undrugged exposure to the elevated plus-maze (EPM) alters future
   behavioral strategy as well as responsivity to conventional anxiolytic
   agents. This EPM retest phenomenon appears to be dependent upon learning
   the spatial configuration of the maze on initial exposure and, in
   particular, the location of the relatively safe enclosed arms. As
   posttraining administration of the glycine, receptor partial agonist,
   D-cycloserine (DCS), has been shown to enhance the consolidation of many
   forms of memory, we have examined the effects of this compound on the
   EPM retest effect in male mice. The results of Experiment 1 confirmed
   that 5 min undrugged exposure to the EPM completed abolishes the
   anxiolytic efficacy of chlordiazepoxide (CDP; 15 mg/kg) on 24 hr retest.
   In Experiment 2, posttraining administration of DCS (7.5 and 15 mg/kg),
   but not CDP (15 mg/kg) or DCS (30 mg/kg), significantly and selectively
   increased time spent in the enclosed arms (and reciprocally decreased
   open arm exploration) on 24 hr retest, a finding consistent with an
   enhancement of consolidation. Experiment 3 used a modified EPM retest
   protocol to assess the effects of posttraining DCS (15 mg/kg) on
   behavioral responses to CDP (15 mg/kg) challenge on 24 hr retest. Using
   a 1-min prior exposure regimen that did not compromise the anxiolytic
   efficacy of CDP in control mice, the results showed that posttraining
   administration of DCS abolished the anxiolytic response to CDP
   challenge. These data strongly suggest that the EPM retest effect
   involves glycine(B)/NMDA receptor-dependent neuroplasticity. Further
   studies will be required to identify the neural circuitry involved.}},

   odorant evoked no significant alteration in behavior. Furthermore, ex
   vivo induction of long-term potentiation within the medial nucleus of
   the amygdala, a principal area involved in olfactory perception, was
   significantly reduced after exposure to natural, but not synthetic,

Abstract = {{Extinction of classically and instrumentally conditioned behaviors, such
   as conditioned fear and drug-seeking behavior, is a process of active
   learning, and recent studies indicate that potentiation of glutamatergic
   transmission facilitates extinction learning. In this study, the authors
   investigated the effects of the Type-5 metabotropic glutamate receptors
   (mGluR5) positive allosteric modulator
   3-cyano-N-(1,3-diphenyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)benzamide (CDPPB) on the
   extinction of cocaine-seeking behavior in rats with a history of
   intravenous cocaine self-administration. To assess its effects on
   acquisition and consolidation of extinction learning, CDPPB (60 mg/kg)
   or vehicle was administered either 20 min prior to, or immediately
   following, each of 10 extinction sessions, respectively. When
   administered prior to each extinction session, CDPPB produced a
   significant reduction in the number of active lever presses on all 10
   days of extinction training as compared to vehicle-treated animals. When
   administered following each extinction session, a significant reduction
   in the number of active lever presses was observed on the 2nd through
   10th day of extinction. Both treatment regimens also reduced the number
   of extinction-training sessions required to meet extinction criteria.
   Pre- or postextinction-training administration of CDPPB did not alter
   responding on the inactive lever and had no effects on open field
   locomotor activity. These data indicate that positive allosteric
   modulation of mGluR5 receptors facilitates the acquisition and
   consolidation of extinction learning following cocaine
   self-administration and may provide a novel pharmacological approach to
   enhancing extinction learning when combined with cue exposure therapy
   for the treatment of cocaine addiction.}},

Abstract = {{Early life stress is a prominent risk factor for the development of
   adult psychopathology. Numerous studies have shown that early life
   stress leads to persistent changes in behavioral and endocrine responses
   to stress. However, despite recent findings of gene expression changes
   and structural abnormalities in neurons of the forebrain neocortex,
   little is known about specific cognitive deficits that can result from
   early life stress. Here we examined five cognitive functions in two
   inbred strains of mice, the stress-resilient strain C57Bl/6 and the
   stress-susceptible strain Balb/c, which were exposed to an infant
   maternal separation paradigm and raised to adulthood. Between postnatal
   ages P60 to P90, mice underwent a series of tests examining five
   cognitive functions: Recognition memory, spatial working memory,
   associative learning, shifts of attentional sets, and reversal learning.
   None of these functions were impaired in IMS C57Bl/6 mice. In contrast,
   IMS Balb/c mice exhibited deficits in spatial working memory and
   extradimensional shifts of attention, that is, functions governed
   primarily by the medial prefrontal cortex. Thus, like recently
   discovered changes in frontocortical gene expression, the emergence of
   specific cognitive deficits associated with the medial prefrontal cortex
   is also strain-specific. These findings illustrate that early life
   stress can indeed affect specific cognitive functions in adulthood, and
   they support the hypothesis that the genetic background and
   environmental factors are critical determinants in the development of
   adult cognitive deficits in subjects with a history of early life
   stress.}},

Abstract = {{In the absence of brain input, spinal systems can adapt to new
   environmental relations. For example, spinally transected rats given a
   legshock each time the leg is extended exhibit a progressive increase in
   flexion duration that minimizes net shock exposure, a simple form of
   instrumental learning. This capacity for learning is modulated by prior
   stimulation; both variable shock and inflammation produce a lasting
   inhibition of learning. An extended exposure to fixed spaced shock has
   no adverse effect on learning and opposes the consequences of variable
   shock. The present studies expand on these findings and demonstrate that
   fixed stimulation ameliorates the impact of peripheral inflammation.
   Spinally transected rats were administered 900 fixed spaced legshocks
   before (Experiment 1) or 1,800 legshocks after (Experiment 2) a
   subcutaneous hindpaw injection of capsaicin. Learning was assessed 24 hr
   later. Treatment with fixed shock attenuated the capsaicin-induced
   inhibition of learning. These findings suggest that fixed stimulation
   promotes adaptive plasticity and may foster recovery after injury.}},

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{125}},

Abstract = {{The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) has been implicated in a range
   of associative learning phenomena often attributed to changes in
   attentional processing of events. Experiments using a number of
   behavioral tasks have shown that rats with lesions of CeA fail to show
   the enhancements of stimulus associability that are normally induced by
   the surprising omission of expected events. By contrast, in other tasks,
   rats with lesions of CeA show normal enhancements of associability when
   events are presented unexpectedly. In this experiment, we examined the
   effects of CeA lesions on changes in cue associability in a reward
   timing task. In sham-lesioned rats, the associability of cues that were
   followed by stimuli that provided reward timing information was
   maintained at higher levels than that of cues that were followed by
   uninformative stimuli. Rats with lesions of CeA failed to show this
   advantage. These results indicate that the role of CeA in the modulation
   of associability is not limited to cases of event omission.}},

Abstract = {{The neural mechanisms underlying the temporal control of behavior are
   largely unknown. Here we recorded from medial agranular cortex neurons
   in rats while they freely behaved in a temporal production task, the
   peak-interval procedure. Due to variability in estimating the time of
   food availability, robust responding typically bracketed the expected
   duration, starting some time before and ending some time after the
   signaled delay. These response periods provided analytic ``steady
   state{''} windows during which subjects actively indicated their
   temporal expectation of food availability. Remarkably, during these
   response periods, a variety of firing patterns were seen that could be
   broadly described as ramps, peaks, and dips, with different slopes,
   directions, and times at which maxima or minima occur. Regularized
   linear discriminant analysis indicated that these patterns provided
   sufficiently reliable information to discriminate the elapsed duration
   of responding within these response periods. Modeling this across neuron
   variability showed that the utilization of ramps, dips, and peaks, with
   different slopes and minimal/maximal rates at different times, led to a
   substantial improvement in temporal prediction errors, suggesting that
   heterogeneity in the neural representation of elapsed time may
   facilitate temporally controlled behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Aggressive behavior is common during adolescence. Although
   aggression-related functional changes in the ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex (vmPFC) and frontopolar cortex (FPC) have been reported in
   adults, the neural correlates of aggressive behavior in adolescents,
   particularly in the context of structural neurodevelopment, are obscure.
   We used functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to
   measure the blood oxygenation level-depended signal and cortical
   thickness. In a block-designed experiment, 14-17-year old adolescents
   imagined aggressive and non-aggressive interactions with a peer. We show
   reduced vmPFC activation associated with imagined aggressive behavior as
   well as enhanced aggression-related activation and cortical thinning in
   the FPC with increasing age. Changes in FPC activation were also
   associated with judgments of the severity of aggressive acts. Reduced
   vmPFC activation was associated with greater aggression indicating its
   normal function is to exert inhibitory control over aggressive impulses.
   Concurrent FPC activation likely reflects foresight of harmful
   consequences that result from aggressive acts. The correlation of
   age-dependent activation changes and cortical thinning demonstrates
   ongoing maturation of the FPC during adolescence towards a refinement of
   social and cognitive information processing that can potentially
   facilitate mature social behavior in aggressive contexts.}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigated age-related differences in the amygdala
   and other nodes of face-processing networks in response to facial
   expression and familiarity. fMRI data were analyzed from 31 children
   (3.5-8.5 years) and 14 young adults (18-33 years) who viewed pictures of
   familiar (mothers) and unfamiliar emotional faces. Results showed that
   amygdala activation for faces over a scrambled image baseline increased
   with age. Children, but not adults, showed greater amygdala activation
   to happy than angry faces; in addition, amygdala activation for angry
   faces increased with age. In keeping with growing evidence of a
   positivity bias in young children, our data suggest that children find
   happy faces to be more salient or meaningful than angry faces. Both
   children and adults showed preferential activation to mothers' over
   strangers' faces in a region of rostral anterior cingulate cortex
   associated with self-evaluation, suggesting that some nodes in frontal
   evaluative networks are active early in development. This study presents
   novel data on neural correlates of face processing in childhood and

Abstract = {{We examined the influence of emotional valence and type of item to be
   remembered on brain activity during recognition, using faces and scenes.
   We used multivariate analyses of event-related fMRI data to identify
   whole-brain patterns, or networks of activity. Participants demonstrated
   better recognition for scenes vs faces and for negative vs neutral and
   positive items. Activity was increased in extrastriate cortex and
   inferior frontal gyri for emotional scenes, relative to neutral scenes
   and all face types. Increased activity in these regions also was seen
   for negative faces relative to positive faces. Correct recognition of
   negative faces and scenes (hits vs correct rejections) was associated
   with increased activity in amygdala, hippocampus, extrastriate, frontal
   and parietal cortices. Activity specific to correctly recognized
   emotional faces, but not scenes, was found in sensorimotor areas and
   rostral prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that emotional valence
   and type of visual stimulus both modulate brain activity at recognition,
   and influence multiple networks mediating visual, memory and emotion
   processing. The contextual information in emotional scenes may
   facilitate memory via additional visual processing, whereas memory for
   emotional faces may rely more on cognitive control mediated by
   rostrolateral prefrontal regions.}},

Abstract = {{This exploratory study examined the extent to which individual
   differences in sensory processing sensitivity (SPS), a
   temperament/personality trait characterized by social, emotional and
   physical sensitivity, are associated with neural response in visual
   areas in response to subtle changes in visual scenes. Sixteen
   participants completed the Highly Sensitive Person questionnaire, a
   standard measure of SPS. Subsequently, they were tested on a change
   detection task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI). SPS was associated with significantly greater activation in
   brain areas involved in high-order visual processing (i.e. right
   claustrum, left occipitotemporal, bilateral temporal and medial and
   posterior parietal regions) as well as in the right cerebellum, when
   detecting minor (vs major) changes in stimuli. These findings remained
   strong and significant after controlling for neuroticism and
   introversion, traits that are often correlated with SPS. These results
   provide the first evidence of neural differences associated with SPS,
   the first direct support for the sensory aspect of this trait that has
   been studied primarily for its social and affective implications, and
   preliminary evidence for heightened sensory processing in individuals
   high in SPS.}},

Abstract = {{Various kinds of normative judgments are an integral part of everyday
   life. We extended the scrutiny of social cognitive neuroscience into the
   domain of legal decisions, investigating two groups, lawyers and other
   academics, during moral and legal decision-making. While we found
   activation of brain areas comprising the so-called `moral brain' in both
   conditions, there was stronger activation in the left dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex and middle temporal gyrus particularly when subjects
   made legal decisions, suggesting that these were made in respect to more
   explicit rules and demanded more complex semantic processing. Comparing
   both groups, our data show that behaviorally lawyers conceived
   themselves as emotionally less involved during normative decision-making
   in general. A group x condition interaction in the dorsal anterior
   cingulate cortex suggests a modulation of normative decision-making by
   attention based on subjects' normative expertise.}},

Abstract = {{Within the neural face-processing network, the right occipital face area
   (rOFA) plays a prominent role, and it has been suggested that it
   receives both feed-forward and re-entrant feedback from other face
   sensitive areas. Its functional role is less well understood and whether
   the rOFA is involved in the initial analysis of a face stimulus or in
   the detailed integration of different face properties remains an open
   question. The present study investigated the functional role of the rOFA
   with regard to different face properties (identity, expression, and
   gaze) using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Experiment 1 showed
   that the rOFA integrates information across different face properties:
   performance for the combined processing of identity and expression
   decreased after TMS to the rOFA, while no impairment was seen in gaze
   processing. In Experiment 2 we examined the temporal dynamics of this
   effect. We pinpointed the impaired integrative computation to 170 ms
   post stimulus presentation. Together the results suggest that TMS to the
   rOFA affects the integrative processing of facial identity and
   expression at a mid-latency processing stage.}},

Abstract = {{Schizophrenia patients display impaired performance and brain activity
   during facial affect recognition. These impairments may reflect
   stimulus-driven perceptual decrements and evaluative processing
   abnormalities. We differentiated these two processes by contrasting
   responses to identical stimuli presented under different contexts.
   Seventeen healthy controls and 16 schizophrenia patients performed an
   fMRI facial affect detection task. Subjects identified an affective
   target presented amongst foils of differing emotions. We hypothesized
   that targeting affiliative emotions (happiness, sadness) would create a
   task demand context distinct from that generated when targeting threat
   emotions (anger, fear). We compared affiliative foil stimuli within a
   congruent affiliative context with identical stimuli presented in an
   incongruent threat context. Threat foils were analysed in the same
   manner. Controls activated right orbitofrontal cortex
   (OFC)/ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) more to affiliative foils
   in threat contexts than to identical stimuli within affiliative
   contexts. Patients displayed reduced OFC/VLPFC activation to all foils,
   and no activation modulation by context. This lack of context modulation
   coincided with a 2-fold decrement in foil detection efficiency. Task
   demands produce contextual effects during facial affective processing in
   regions activated during affect evaluation. In schizophrenia, reduced
   modulation of OFC/VLPFC by context coupled with reduced behavioural
   efficiency suggests impaired ventral prefrontal control mechanisms that
   optimize affective appraisal.}},

Abstract = {{Anticipation is a central component of anxiety and the anterior insula
   appears to be an important neural substrate in which this process is
   mediated. The anterior insula is also thought to underlie the
   interoceptive representation of one's affective state. However, the
   degree to which individual differences in anticipation-related insula
   reactivity are associated with variability in the subjective experience
   of anxious anticipation is untested. To assess this possibility,
   functional magnetic resonance images were acquired while participants
   completed an auditory anticipation task with trial-by-trial self-report
   ratings of anxious anticipation. We hypothesized that the anterior
   insula would be positively associated with an individual's subjective
   experience of anticipatory anxiety. The results provide evidence for an
   amygdalo-insular system involved in anxious auditory anticipation.
   Reactivity in the right anterior insula was predictive of individuals'
   subjective experience of anxious anticipation for both aversive and
   neutral stimuli, whereas the amygdala was predictive of anticipatory
   anxiety for aversive stimuli. In addition, anxious anticipatory
   activation in the left insula and left amygdala covaried with
   participants' level of trait anxiety, particularly when the anticipated
   event was proximal.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigated gender differences in the associations

   adolescent delinquency, short temper and thrill seeking. We also
   explored whether the gender-specific expression of the DRD4 can be

   such as poor parent-child relationship. Participants were 263 14- to
   17-year olds (50\% males) living in Russia. DNA was extracted from
   saliva samples and the VNTR DRD4 polymorphisms were genotyped using
   polymerase chain reaction. Participants reported on the extent of their
   delinquent behaviour, short temper, thrill seeking and exposure to
   psychosocial risk (i.e. poor parental monitoring of adolescent
   behaviour, exposure to violence and peer delinquency). Compared to
   individuals with the 4/4 genotype, males, but not females, with the
   7-repeat allele (7R) had significantly higher delinquency, short temper
   and thrill seeking. This interaction effect, however, was completely
   explained by males' higher exposure to psychosocial risk factors. When
   parental monitoring of youths' activities and youth exposure to violence
   were included in the model, the 7R x gender interaction was no longer
   significant. Thus, social context plays an important role in explaining
   gender-specific phenotypic expression of the DRD4 gene.}},

Abstract = {{The computation by which our brain elaborates fast responses to
   emotional expressions is currently an active field of brain studies.
   Previous studies have focused on stimuli taken from everyday life. Here,
   we investigated event-related potentials in response to happy vs neutral
   stimuli of human and non-humanoid robots. At the behavioural level,
   emotion shortened reaction times similarly for robotic and human
   stimuli. Early P1 wave was enhanced in response to happy compared to
   neutral expressions for robotic as well as for human stimuli, suggesting
   that emotion from robots is encoded as early as human emotion
   expression. Congruent with their lower faceness properties compared to
   human stimuli, robots elicited a later and lower N170 component than
   human stimuli. These findings challenge the claim that robots need to
   present an anthropomorphic aspect to interact with humans. Taken
   together, such results suggest that the early brain processing of
   emotional expressions is not bounded to human-like arrangements
   embodying emotion.}},

Abstract = {{According to theories of emotional complexity, individuals low in
   emotional complexity encode and represent emotions in visceral or
   action-oriented terms, whereas individuals high in emotional complexity
   encode and represent emotions in a differentiated way, using multiple
   emotion concepts. During functional magnetic resonance imaging,
   participants viewed valenced animated scenarios of simple ball-like
   figures attending either to social or spatial aspects of the
   interactions. Participant's emotional complexity was assessed using the
   Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale. We found a distributed set of brain
   regions previously implicated in processing emotion from facial, vocal
   and bodily cues, in processing social intentions, and in emotional
   response, were sensitive to emotion conveyed by motion alone. Attention
   to social meaning amplified the influence of emotion in a subset of
   these regions. Critically, increased emotional complexity correlated
   with enhanced processing in a left temporal polar region implicated in
   detailed semantic knowledge; with a diminished effect of social
   attention; and with increased differentiation of brain activity between
   films of differing valence. Decreased emotional complexity was
   associated with increased activity in regions of pre-motor cortex. Thus,
   neural coding of emotion in semantic vs action systems varies as a
   function of emotional complexity, helping reconcile puzzling
   inconsistencies in neuropsychological investigations of emotion
   recognition.}},

Abstract = {{The present study used event-related brain potentials to examine the

   pictures of hand gestures with negative (insult) and positive (approval)

   dense sensor event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. Emotion
   effects were reflected in distinct ERP modulations in early and later
   time windows. Insult gestures elicited increased P1, early posterior
   negativity (EPN) and late positive potential (LPP) components as
   compared to neutral control gestures. Processing of approval gestures
   was associated with an increased P1 wave and enlarged EPN amplitudes
   during an early time window, while the LPP amplitude was not
   significantly modulated. Accordingly, negative insult gestures appear
   more potent than positive approval gestures in inducing a heightened

Abstract = {{This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate how
   assumptions about speakers' abilities changed the evoked BOLD response
   in secular and Christian participants who received intercessory prayer.
   We find that recipients' assumptions about senders' charismatic
   abilities have important effects on their executive network. Most
   notably, the Christian participants deactivated the frontal network
   consisting of the medial and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   bilaterally in response to speakers who they believed had healing
   abilities. An independent analysis across subjects revealed that this
   deactivation predicted the Christian participants' subsequent ratings of
   the speakers' charisma and experience of God's presence during prayer.
   These observations point to an important mechanism of authority that may
   facilitate charismatic influence, a mechanism which is likely to be
   present in other interpersonal interactions as well.}},

Abstract = {{Prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been implicated in the experience and
   regulation of emotional states. Emotional experience is a complex
   construct, encompassing a range of more specific processes. This
   exploratory study aimed to delineate which (if any) aspects of emotional
   experience rely critically on either the ventromedial frontal (VMF) or
   lateral frontal (LF) lobes. The affective experience of individuals with
   damage to these regions was surveyed in detail using several measures
   and compared with that of control participants. Dependent measures
   included subjective and observer ratings of both dispositional affect
   and transient responses to laboratory mood inductions. VMF damage was
   associated with greater negative dispositional affect relative to
   controls and to individuals with LF damage; however, transient responses
   to emotional stimuli were largely normal. In contrast, LF damage was
   associated with an exaggerated subjective reactivity to sad emotional
   stimuli relative to control participants, but normal dispositional
   affect. Interestingly, neither form of PFC damage affected spontaneous
   emotion recovery following the mood inductions. These findings suggest a
   role for VMF in modulating dispositional negative affect; in contrast,
   LF areas appear to be critical in regulating transient emotional
   responses while emotional stimuli are present. This study also
   illustrates the dissociability of different aspects of emotional
   experience in patients with focal brain injury.}},

Abstract = {{The Beauty-is-Good stereotype refers to the assumption that attractive
   people possess sociably desirable personalities and higher moral
   standards. The existence of this bias suggests that the neural
   mechanisms for judging facial attractiveness and moral goodness overlap.
   To investigate this idea, we scanned participants with functional
   magnetic resonance imaging while they made attractiveness judgments
   about faces and goodness judgments about hypothetical actions. Activity
   in the medial orbitofrontal cortex increased as a function of both
   attractiveness and goodness ratings, whereas activity in the insular
   cortex decreased with both attractiveness and goodness ratings. Within
   each of these regions, the activations elicited by attractiveness and
   goodness judgments were strongly correlated with each other, supporting
   the idea of similar contributions of each region to both judgments.
   Moreover, activations in orbitofrontal and insular cortices were
   negatively correlated with each other, suggesting an opposing
   relationship between these regions during attractiveness and goodness
   judgments. These findings have implications for understanding the neural
   mechanisms of the Beauty-is-Good stereotype.}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-21}},
Abstract = {{The present study aimed at identifying dysfunctions in brain networks
   that may underlie disturbed empathic behavior in autism spectrum
   disorders (ASD). During functional magnetic resonance imaging, subjects
   were asked to identify the emotional state observed in a facial stimulus
   (other-task) or to evaluate their own emotional response (self-task).
   Behaviorally, ASD subjects performed equally to the control group during
   the other-task, but showed less emotionally congruent responses in the
   self-task. Activations in brain regions related to theory of mind were
   observed in both groups. Activations of the medial prefrontal cortex
   (MPFC) were located in dorsal subregions in ASD subjects and in ventral
   areas in control subjects. During the self-task, ASD subjects activated
   an additional network of frontal and inferior temporal areas. Frontal
   areas previously associated with the human mirror system were activated
   in both tasks in control subjects, while ASD subjects recruited these
   areas during the self-task only. Activations in the ventral MPFC may
   provide the basis for one's oemotional bondo with other persons'
   emotions. Such atypical patterns of activation may underlie disturbed
   empathy in individuals with ASD. Subjects with ASD may use an atypical
   cognitive strategy to gain access to their own emotional state in
   response to other people's emotions.}},

   to faces? Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we report
   onormalizationo of activity in the right fusiform gyrus, but not the
   amygdalae, when individuals with autism were compelled to perform visual
   scanpaths that involved fixating on the eyes of a fearful face. These

   brain dysfunction in autism, theories of the role of the fusiform gyri
   in face processing, and the design of more effective interventions for

Abstract = {{Previous evidence indicates that we understand others' actions not only
   by perceiving their visual features but also by their sound. This raises
   the possibility that brain regions responsible for action understanding
   respond to cues coming from different sensory modalities. Yet no
   studies, to date, have examined if this extends to olfaction. Here we
   addressed this issue by using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We
   searched for brain activity related to the observation of an action
   executed towards an object that was smelled rather than seen. The
   results show that temporal, parietal, and frontal areas were activated
   when individuals observed a hand grasping a smelled object. This
   activity differed from that evoked during the observation of a mimed
   grasp. Furthermore, superadditive activity was revealed when the action
   target-object was both seen and smelled. Together these findings
   indicate the influence of olfaction on action understanding and its
   contribution to multimodal action representations.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{48-62}},
Abstract = {{The present study is the first to investigate the relationship between
   vagal tone level and event-related potentials (ERPs) in adults. Numerous
   studies have shown a relationship between vagal tone and the individual
   differences between a variety of psychophysiological, affective, and
   social outcomes. This suggests that vagal tone can be related to how
   people process relevant affective social information at the brain level.
   This study aimed to assess whether the ERP response varies between high
   and low vagal tone groups, in the face of salient affective information.
   In the experimental cohort, two groups were separated according to their
   vagal tone level. ERPs were recorded while individuals performed an
   affective picture task that included positive, neutral, and negative
   emotional stimuli. Differences between the high and low vagal tone
   groups were observed at the early posterior negativity for both positive
   and negative valences, and at the late positive potential for all the
   categories. It can be concluded that differences between high and low
   vagal tone levels are related to differences in the ERPs at early,
   middle, and late latencies. The results are discussed with respect to
   the effect of differences between the vagal tone conditions on various
   stages of information-processing.}},

   in response to playback of female ultrasonic vocalizations}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{76-87}},
Abstract = {{The opioid system controls social behavior and it was hypothesized that
   it therefore plays a role in neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism
   that are characterized by social and communication deficits. Mice
   communicate via ultrasonic vocalizations. As pups, they produce
   ultrasonic vocalizations when isolated from dam and littermates. These
   calls serve an important biological purpose, since they elicit search
   and retrieval behavior in the mother. Administration of
   -opioid-receptor-agonists diminishes such isolation-induced ultrasonic
   vocalizations and -opioid-receptor knock-out mouse pups (Orpm-/-) emit
   fewer ultrasonic vocalizations during isolation than intact controls
   (Orpm+/+). In adulthood, male and female mice produce ultrasonic
   vocalizations during social interactions. However, little is known about
   occurrence and function of ultrasonic vocalizations produced by adult
   females. Here, we conducted a playback experiment in order to assess
   whether female ultrasonic vocalizations elicit changes in the
   recipient's behavior and whether a possible change in behavior is
   dependent on a functioning opioid system by comparing Orpm-/- mice with
   Orpm+/+ controls. Our results showed that female ultrasonic
   vocalizations elicit exploratory activity in male recipients and that
   elicitation of exploratory activity in response to female ultrasonic
   vocalizations is dependent on an intact opioid system, since such a
   response was not seen in Orpm-/- mice. Lack of exploratory activation
   seen in Orpm-/- mice is unlikely due to hearing deficits as shown by an
   auditory cued fear-conditioning-task. Hence, these findings support the
   phenotypic relevance of Orpm-/- mice for the study of autism.}},

Abstract = {{A large body of evidence links altered opioid signaling with changes in
   social behavior in animals. However, few studies have attempted to
   determine whether similar links exist in humans. Here we investigate
   whether a common polymorphism (A118G) in the mu-opioid receptor gene
   (OPRM1) is associated with alterations in personality traits linked to
   affiliative behavior and attachment. In a mixed sample (N = 214) of
   adult healthy volunteers and psychiatric patients, we analyzed the
   association between the A118G polymorphism of the OPRM1 and two
   different psychological constructs reflecting individual differences in
   the capacity to experience social reward. Compared to individuals
   expressing only the major allele (A) of the A118G polymorphism, subjects
   expressing the minor allele (G) had an increased tendency to become
   engaged in affectionate relationships, as indicated by lower scores on a
   self-report measure of avoidant attachment, and experienced more
   pleasure in social situations, as indicated by lower scores on a
   self-report measure of social anhedonia. The OPRM1 variation accounted
   for about 3.5\% of the variance in the two measures. The significant
   association between the A118G polymorphism and social hedonic capacity
   was independent of the participants' mental health status. The results
   reported here are in agreement with the brain opioid hypothesis of
   social attachment and the established role of opioid transmission in
   mediating affiliative behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Our own name, due to its high social relevance, is supposed to have a
   unique status in our information processing. However, demonstrating this
   phenomenon empirically proves difficult as famous and unknown names, to
   which self-name is often compared in the studies, may differ from
   self-name not only in terms of the `me vs. not-me' distinction, but also
   as regards their emotional content and frequency of occurrence in
   everyday life. In this fMRI study, apart from famous and unknown names
   we used the names of the most important persons in our subjects' lives.
   When compared to famous or unknown names recognition, self-name
   recognition was associated with robust activations in widely distributed
   bilateral network including fronto-temporal, limbic and subcortical
   structures, however, when compared to significant other's name, the
   activations were present specifically in the right inferior frontal
   gyrus. In addition, the significant other's name produced a similar
   pattern of activations to the one activated by self-name. These results
   suggest that the differences between own and other's name processing may
   rather be quantitative than qualitative in nature.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{6}},

Pages = {{113-122}},
Abstract = {{Patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) exhibit
   a set of behavioral disturbances that have been strongly associated with
   involvement of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Many such disturbances have
   been linked to impaired moral behavior, especially in regard to
   opersonalo or oemotionally driveno moral dilemmatic judgment, which has
   been demonstrated to also depend on the integrity of the PFC. In this
   study, we administered a personal moral dilemma (the footbridge dilemma)
   and social cognition measures to patients with early bvFTD, who were
   also assessed with an extensive neuropsychological battery, including
   moral knowledge, cognitive and emotional empathy, and affective
   decision-making. BvFTD patients who would push a man off a footbridge
   (knowing this would kill him) to save the life of five workers who would
   have been otherwise killed by the train showed significantly lower
   scores on affective Theory of Mind (ToM) relative to those bvFTD
   patients who responded negatively. No significant differences were found
   on other sociodemographic, neuropsychological or social cognition
   variables. This study reveals that altered dilemmatic judgment may be
   related to impaired affective ToM, which has important clinical and
   theoretical implications.}},

Title = {{Spontaneous and intentional trait inferences recruit a common

   activate only its core areas}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{123-138}},
Abstract = {{This fMRI study analyzes inferences on other persons' traits, whereby
   half of the participants were given spontaneous (oreado) instructions
   while the other half were given intentional (oinfer the person's traito)
   instructions. Several sentences described the behavior of a target
   person from which a strong trait could be inferred (trait diagnostic) or
   not (trait nondiagnostic). A direct contrast between spontaneous and
   intentional instructions revealed no significant differences, indicating
   that the same social mentalizing network was recruited. There was,
   however, a difference with respect to different brain areas that passed
   the significance threshold, suggesting that this common network was
   recruited to a different degree. Specifically, spontaneous inferences
   significantly recruited only core mentalizing areas, including the
   temporo-parietal junction and medial prefrontal cortex, whereas
   intentional inferences additionally recruited other brain areas,
   including the (pre)cuneus, superior temporal sulcus, temporal poles, and
   parts of the premotor and parietal cortex. These results suggest that
   intentional instructions invite observers to think more about the
   material they read, and consider it in many ways besides its social
   impact. Future research on the neurological underpinnings of trait
   inference might profit from the use of spontaneous instructions to get
   purer results that involve only the core brain areas in social judgment.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{139-155}},
Abstract = {{Using event-related potentials, we investigated how the brain extracts
   information from another's face and translates it into relevant action
   in real time. In Study 1, participants made between-hand sex
   categorizations of sex-typical and sex-atypical faces. Sex-atypical
   faces evoked negativity between 250 and 550 ms (N300/N400 effects),
   reflecting the integration of accumulating sex-category knowledge into a
   coherent sex-category interpretation. Additionally, the lateralized
   readiness potential revealed that the motor cortex began preparing for a
   correct hand response while social category knowledge was still
   gradually evolving in parallel. In Study 2, participants made
   between-hand eye-color categorizations as part of go/no-go trials that
   were contingent on a target's sex. On no-go trials, although the hand
   did not actually move, information about eye color partially prepared
   the motor cortex to move the hand before perception of sex had
   finalized. Together, these findings demonstrate the dynamic continuity
   between person perception and action, such that ongoing results from
   face processing are immediately and continuously cascaded into the motor
   system over time. The preparation of action begins based on tentative
   perceptions of another's face before perceivers have finished
   interpreting what they just saw.}},

Title = {{Maternal care differs in mice bred for high vs. low trait anxiety:
   Impact of brain vasopressin and cross-fostering}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{156-168}},
Abstract = {{Brain arginine vasopressin (AVP) not only regulates male social behavior
   and emotionality, but also promotes maternal behavior, as has been shown
   in rats. In our CD1 mice breed for high (HAB) or low (LAB)
   anxiety-related behavior, LAB mice have markedly less AVP mRNA
   expression in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus compared with HAB
   mice. Together these findings suggest that HAB and LAB mice represent a
   good model to assess the role of AVP in mouse maternal behavior.
   Therefore, we studied maternal care of HAB and LAB mouse dams and
   investigated the impact of maternal care on the offspring's anxiety in a
   cross-fostering paradigm. In comparison with HAB dams, LABs displayed
   less maternal care. Daily acute intracerebroventricular infusions of AVP
   in early lactation increased maternal care of LAB dams and acted
   anxiogenically. Cross-fostering on postnatal day 5 did not alter
   separation-induced high and low ultrasonic vocalization calling
   frequency, a measure of inborn anxiety, in HAB and LAB offspring,
   respectively. However, adult cross-fostered HAB mice displayed a trend
   towards decreased anxiety on the elevated plus-maze, which was still
   significantly higher compared with LAB mice. The low levels of
   depressive-like behavior, stress-reactivity, and hypothalamic AVP mRNA
   expression in adult LAB offspring were found to be independent of
   cross-fostering. In conclusion, the HAB/LAB differences in maternal care
   and anxiety are robust and strongly depend on differences in the AVP
   system. The seemingly rigid genetic predisposition to hyperanxiety can
   only be moderately attenuated by the received nurturing.}},

Abstract = {{The oframing effecto (FE) describes the phenomenon whereby human choices

   inhibition during a stop-signal task (SST). We hypothesized that
   inhibitory control is inversely associated with susceptibility to
   framing effects. Forty adult volunteers performed a risky-choice framing
   task in which identical information about wins and losses was presented
   using loss or gain frames. As predicted, there was an inverse
   association between HRV and framing effects, accounting for 23\% of the
   variance in framing effects. Inhibitory control as indexed by
   performance in the SST was not associated with framing effects. These
   results are discussed in terms of the role of inhibitory processes (as
   indicated by vagal activity) for decision-making processes.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{178-189}},
Abstract = {{Regret-related brain activity is dependent on free choice, but it is
   unclear whether this activity is a function of more subtle differences
   in the degree of responsibility a decision-maker exerts over a
   regrettable outcome. In this experiment, we show that trial-by-trial
   subjective ratings of regret depend on a higher subjective sense of
   responsibility, as well as being dependent on objective responsibility.
   Using fMRI we show an enhanced amygdala response to regret-related
   outcomes when these outcomes are associated with high, as compared to
   low, responsibility. This enhanced response was maximal in participants
   who showed a greater level of enhancement in their subjective ratings of
   regret engendered by an objective increase in responsibility.
   Orbitofrontal and cingulate cortex showed opposite effects, with an
   enhanced response for regret-related outcomes when participants were not
   objectively responsible. The findings indicate that the way the brain
   processes regret-related outcomes depends on both objective and
   subjective aspects of responsibility, highlighting the critical
   importance of the amygdala.}},

Title = {{Does higher general trust serve as a psychosocial buffer against social
   pain? An NIRS study of social exclusion}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{190-197}},
Abstract = {{Social exclusion evokes social pain in excluded individuals.
   Neuroimaging studies suggest that this social pain is associated with
   activation of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), with further
   regulation of social pain being reflected in activation of the right
   ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (rVLPFC). The present study focused on
   factors that influence activation of the rVLPFC during social exclusion.
   We conducted a near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) experiment to
   investigate whether two psychosocial resources (general trust and trait
   self-esteem) increase rVLPFC activity during social exclusion, thereby
   buffering against social pain. Thirty-seven undergraduates participated
   in an NIRS session in which they were socially rejected during an online
   ball-tossing game. Levels of general trust and trait self-esteem were
   negatively correlated with self-reported social pain in the exclusion
   conditions. Furthermore, general trust was positively correlated with
   rVLPFC activity, although there was no such relationship with
   self-esteem. rVLPFC activity mediated the relationship between general
   trust levels and social pain. The rVLPFC appears to be critical for the
   regulation of social pain. Taken together, these findings suggest that
   general trust and trait self-esteem probably have different impacts at
   different times over the course of a series of adaptive processes, all
   geared toward the modulation of social pain.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{198-208}},
Abstract = {{Values are motivational constructs that determine what is important to
   us and which goals we choose to pursue. Cross-cultural research suggests
   that the structure of the human value system is universal, but people
   and cultures differ in terms of relative value priorities. Differences
   in psychological value hierarchies can be parsimoniously described using
   the orthogonal dimensions self-interest and openness to change. Using
   fMRI, we investigated whether individual differences in these universal
   dimensions are reflected in basic neural reward mechanisms during a
   donation task and a GO/NOGO-task. Individuals with high self-interest
   value sacrificed less money for charitable donations and showed higher
   activation of the ventral striatum when receiving monetary rewards.
   Furthermore, individuals with high openness to change value showed a
   greater sensitivity of the dorsal striatum when trying to inhibit
   habitual prepotent responses. Our findings suggest that
   context-dependent neural reward sensitivity biases reflect (and may even
   determine) differences in individual value hierarchies and underlie the

   features of the human mind. Recent research has suggested that this
   ability may be subserved by a particular brain region: the medial
   prefrontal cortex (MPFC). However, although humans can contemplate a
   variety of different aspects of themselves, including their stable
   personality traits, current feelings, and physical attributes, no
   research has directly examined the extent to which these different forms
   of self-reflection are subserved by common mechanisms. To address this
   question, participants were scanned using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) while making judgments about their own personality
   traits, current mental states, and physical attributes as well as those
   of another person. Whereas some brain regions responded preferentially
   during only one form of self-reflection, a robust region of MPFC was
   engaged preferentially during self-reflection across all three types of
   judgment. These results suggest thatalthough dissociablediverse forms of
   self-referential thought draw on a shared cognitive process subserved by
   MPFC.}},

Abstract = {{Being touched by another person influences our readiness to empathize
   with and support that person. We asked whether this influence arises
   from somatosensory experience, the proximity to the person and/or an
   attribution of the somatosensory experience to the person. Moreover, we
   were interested in whether and how touch affects the processing of
   ensuing events. To this end, we presented neutral and negative pictures
   with or without gentle pressure to the participants' forearm. In
   Experiment 1, pressure was applied by a friend, applied by a tactile
   device and attributed to the friend, or applied by a tactile device and
   attributed to a computer. Across these conditions, touch enhanced
   event-related potential (ERP) correlates of picture processing. Pictures
   elicited a larger posterior N100 and a late positivity discriminated
   more strongly between pictures of neutral and negative content when
   participants were touched. Experiment 2 replicated these findings while
   controlling for the predictive quality of touch. Experiment 3 replaced
   tactile contact with a tone, which failed to enhance N100 amplitude and
   emotion discrimination reflected by the late positivity. This indicates
   that touch sensitizes ongoing cognitive and emotional processes and that
   this sensitization is mediated by bottom-up somatosensory processing.
   Moreover, touch seems to be a special sensory signal that influences
   recipients in the absence of conscious reflection and that promotes
   prosocial behavior.}},

Abstract = {{oMindfulnesso is a capacity for heightened present-moment awareness that
   we all possess to a greater or lesser extent. Enhancing this capacity
   through training has been shown to alleviate stress and promote physical
   and mental well-being. As a consequence, interest in mindfulness is
   growing and so is the need to better understand it. This study employed
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify the brain
   regions involved in state mindfulness and to shed light on its
   mechanisms of action. Significant signal decreases were observed during
   mindfulness meditation in midline cortical structures associated with
   interoception, including bilateral anterior insula, left ventral
   anterior cingulate cortex, right medial prefrontal cortex, and bilateral
   precuneus. Significant signal increase was noted in the right posterior
   cingulate cortex. These findings lend support to the theory that
   mindfulness achieves its positive outcomes through a process of
   disidentification.}},

Title = {{Conflict-dependent dynamic of subthalamic nucleus oscillations during
   moral decisions}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{243-256}},
Abstract = {{Although lesional, neuroimaging, and brain stimulation studies have
   provided an insight into the neural mechanisms of judgement and
   decision-making, all these works focused on the cerebral cortex, without
   investigating the role of subcortical structures such as the basal
   ganglia. Besides being an effective therapeutic tool, deep brain
   stimulation (DBS) allows local field potential (LFP) recordings through
   the stimulation electrodes thus providing a physiological owindowo on
   human subcortical structures. In this study we assessed whether
   subthalamic nucleus LFP oscillations are modulated by processing of
   moral conflictual, moral nonconflictual, and neutral statements. To do
   so, in 16 patients with Parkinson's disease (8 men) bilaterally
   implanted with subthalamic nucleus (STN) electrodes for DBS, we recorded
   STN LFPs 4 days after surgery during a moral decision task. During the
   task, recordings from the STN showed changes in LFP oscillations.
   Whereas the 14-30 Hz band (beta) changed during the movement executed to
   perform the task, the 5-13 Hz band (low-frequency) changed when subjects
   evaluated the content of statements. Low-frequency band power increased
   significantly more during conflictual than during nonconflictual or
   neutral sentences. We conclude that STN responds specifically to
   conflictual moral stimuli, and could be involved in conflictual
   decisions of all kinds, not only those for moral judgment. LFP
   oscillations provide novel direct evidence that the neural processing of
   conflictual decision-making spreads beyond the cortex to the basal
   ganglia and encompasses a specific subcortical conflict-dependent
   component.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{257-269}},
Abstract = {{Research has shown that gaze cuing of attention is reflected in the
   modulation of P1 and N1 components of ERPs time-locked to target onset.
   Studies focusing on cue-locked analyses have produced mixed results. The
   present study examined ERP reflections of gaze cuing in further detail
   by recording electric brain activity from the scalp of participants
   engaged in a spatial cuing paradigm with noninformative gaze cues
   embedded in fearful, disgusted, or neutral faces. Unlike previous work,
   we focused on N2pc, a recent ERP index of attention shifting over space.
   Behavioral data showed that gaze-driven orienting was not influenced by
   facial expression. Importantly, electrophysiological data showed a
   significant amplitude modulation of the N2pc time-locked to target onset
   as a function of cue-target spatial congruence. This pattern, however,
   was independent of facial expression. The results are interpreted as
   evidence that N2pc can be used as a marker of reorienting of attention
   in spatially incongruent trials due to gaze cuing. The overall findings
   support the idea that the effects of facial expression on gaze cuing are
   weak and likely context-dependent.}},

   sensitivities to the chemosensory emotional cues from their partner vs.

   subconsciously sharpens one's sensitivity to chemosensory emotional
   cues, which increases as a function of the time couples have spent
   together. Nevertheless, the specific chemosensory identity and emotional
   content remain undelineated and inaccessible to verbal awareness. Our

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{277-288}},
Abstract = {{This electroencephalography (EEG) study investigated at which temporal
   processing stages self-other discrimination in emotion processing
   occurs. EEG was recorded in 23 healthy participants during silent
   reading of unpleasant, pleasant, and neutral pronoun-noun and
   article-noun expressions that were related to the participants
   themselves, related to an unknown third person, or had no self-other
   reference at all. Self- and other-related pronoun-noun pairs elicited
   larger cortical negativity relative to the processing of article-noun
   pairs at left posterior electrodes as early as 200 ms after stimulus
   onset. In the same time windows (from 200 ms to 300 ms and 300 ms to 400
   ms) the emotionality of the words enhanced event-related brain potential
   (ERP) amplitudes at parieto-occipital electrodes. From 350 ms onwards,
   processing of self-related unpleasant words elicited larger frontal
   negativity compared to unpleasant words that were related to the other
   or that had no reference at all. In addition, processing of pleasant
   words vs. neutral or unpleasant words elicited larger positive
   amplitudes over parietal electrodes from 450 ms after stimulus onset, in
   particular when words were self-related. Our findings demonstrate that
   for verbal emotional stimuli, self-other discrimination first occurs at
   higher-order, cortical processing stages. This is consistent with the
   view that categorization of information according to certain stimulus
   aspects (self-other reference, emotionality) occurs before its meaning
   is integrated.}},

Title = {{A genetic contribution to cooperation: Dopamine-relevant genes are

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},

Pages = {{289-301}},
Abstract = {{Social loafing and social facilitation are stable behavioral effects
   that describe increased or decreased motivation, as well as effort and
   cooperation in teamwork as opposed to individual working situations.
   Recent twin studies demonstrate the heritability of cooperative
   behavior. Brain imaging studies have shown that reciprocity,
   cooperativeness, and social rewards activate reward processing areas
   with strong dopaminergic input, such as the ventral striatum. Thus,
   candidate genes for social behavior are hypothesized to affect
   dopaminergic neurotransmission. In the present study, we investigated
   the dopaminergic genetic contribution to social cooperation, especially
   to social loafing and social facilitation. N = 106 healthy, Caucasian
   subjects participated in the study and were genotyped for three
   polymorphisms relevant to the dopaminergic system (COMTval158met, DRD2
   c957t, DRD2 rs\#2283265). In addition to a main effect indicating an
   increased performance in teamwork situations, we found a significant
   interaction between a haplotype block covering both DRD2 single
   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs\#6277 and rs\#2283265), henceforth
   referred to as the DRD2-haplotype block, and the COMT val158met
   polymorphism (rs\#4680) with social facilitation. Carriers of the DRD2
   CT-haplotype block and at least one Val-allele showed a greater increase
   in performance in teamwork settings when compared with carriers of the
   CT-haplotype block and the Met/Met-genotype. Our results suggest that
   epistasis between COMTval158met and the two DRD2 SNPs contributes to
   individual differences in cooperativeness in teamwork settings.}},

Abstract = {{Moral judgment depends critically on theory of mind (ToM), reasoning
   about mental states such as beliefs and intentions. People assign blame
   for failed attempts to harm and offer forgiveness in the case of

   judgment of harmful vs. helpful actions. Is ToM deployed differently for
   judgments of blame vs. praise? Participants evaluated agents who
   produced a harmful, helpful, or neutral outcome, based on a harmful,
   helpful, or neutral intention; participants made blame and praise
   judgments. In the right temporo-parietal junction (right TPJ), and, to a
   lesser extent, the left TPJ and medial prefrontal cortex, the neural
   response reflected an interaction between belief and outcome factors,
   for both blame and praise judgments: The response in these regions was
   highest when participants delivered a negative moral judgment, i.e.,
   assigned blame or withheld praise, based solely on the agent's intent
   (attempted harm, accidental help). These results show enhanced attention
   to mental states for negative moral verdicts based exclusively on mental

Title = {{Abnormal temporal and parietal magnetic activations during the early

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{316-326}},
Abstract = {{Schizophrenia is associated with abnormal cortical activation during
   theory of mind (ToM), as demonstrated by several fMRI or PET studies.
   Electrical and temporal characteristics of these abnormalities,
   especially in the early stages, remain unexplored. Nineteen medicated
   schizophrenic patients and 21 healthy controls underwent
   magnetoencephalography (MEG) recording to measure brain response evoked
   by nonverbal stimuli requiring mentalizing. Three conditions based on
   comic-strips were contrasted: attribution of intentions to others (AI),
   physical causality with human characters (PCCH), and physical causality
   with objects (PCOB). Minimum norm localization was performed in order to
   select regions of interest (ROIs) within bilateral temporal and parietal
   regions that showed significant ToM-related activations in the control
   group. Time-courses of each ROI were compared across group and
   condition. Reduced cortical activation within the 200 to 600 ms
   time-window was observed in the selected regions in patients.
   Significant group by condition interactions (i.e., reduced modulation in
   patients) were found in right posterior superior temporal sulcus, right
   temporoparietal junction, and right inferior parietal lobule during
   attribution of intentions. As in healthy controls, the presence of
   characters elicited activation in patients' left posterior temporal
   regions and temporoparietal junction. No group difference on evoked
   responses' latencies in AI was found. In conclusion, ToM processes in
   the early stages are functionally impaired in schizophrenia. MEG
   provides a promising means to refine our knowledge on schizophrenic
   social cognitive disorders.}},

   evidence}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{327-335}},
Abstract = {{It has been proposed that the human mirror neuron system (MNS) plays an
   integral role in mediating empathy. In this review, we critically
   examine evidence from three bodies of research that have been cited as
   supporting this notion: (1) behavioral studies that have examined the
   relationship between imitation and empathy, (2) findings from functional
   neuroimaging studies that report a positive correlation between MNS
   activation and self-report on an empathy questionnaire, and (3)
   observations of impaired imitation and empathy in autism spectrum
   disorders (ASD). In addition, we briefly review lesion studies of the
   neural correlates of imitation and empathy. Current evidence suggests
   that the MNS is broadly involved in empathy, but at this stage there has
   been limited consideration of its various forms, including motor,
   emotional, and cognitive empathy. There are also various forms of
   imitation, encompassing emotional and non-emotional, automatic, and
   voluntary actions. We propose that the relationship between imitation
   and empathy may vary depending on the specific type of each of these
   abilities. Furthermore, these abilities may be mediated by partially
   distinct neural networks, which involve the MNS to a variable degree.}},

Pages = {{336-347}},
Abstract = {{Attachment disorganization in infancy is a risk factor for behavior
   problems and other psychopathology. Traditionally the role of parental
   behavior for qualitative differences in early attachment relationships
   has been emphasized. However, disrupted infant-parent interactions only
   partly explain attachment disorganization. A complementary focus on
   child factors such as early differences in the underlying
   neurobiological systems is needed. We examined whether early structural
   differences in the gangliothalamic ovoid, comprising the basal ganglia
   and the thalamus, are involved in the etiology of infant attachment
   disorganization. Gangliothalamic ovoid diameter was measured by
   ultrasound in 6-week-old participants of a prospective population-based
   cohort study. Attachment classification of 629 of these infants was
   assessed with the strange situation at 14 months of age. Neurobiological
   differences within the normal range were prospectively associated with
   attachment disorganization. Infants with a larger gangliothalamic ovoid
   at 6 weeks had a lower risk of attachment disorganization at 14 months
   (OR = 0.73 per SD increase in diameter, 95\% CI 0.57-0.93, p < .05).
   Volume of the lateral ventricles as an index of general brain
   development was not associated with attachment disorganization. These
   findings provide new insight into the etiology of infant attachment
   disorganization that may in part be neurodevelopmentally determined.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{360-368}},
Abstract = {{Facial expressions are a potent source of information about how others
   evaluate our behavior. In the present study, we investigated how the
   internal performance-monitoring system, as reflected by error-related
   negativity (ERN), is affected by external cues of positive (happy faces)
   or negative evaluation (disgusted faces) of performance. We hypothesized
   that if the social context indeed impacts on how we evaluate our own
   performance, we would expect that the same performance error would
   result in larger ERN amplitudes in the context of negative evaluation
   than in a positive evaluation context. Our findings confirm our
   predictions: ERN amplitudes were largest when stimuli consisted of
   disgusted faces, compared to when stimuli consisted of happy faces.
   Importantly, ERN amplitudes in our control condition, in which sad faces
   were used as stimuli, were no different from the positive evaluation
   condition, ruling out the possibility that effects in the negative
   evaluation condition resulted from negative affect per se. We suggest
   that external social cues of approval or disapproval impact on how we
   evaluate our own performance at a very basic level: The brain processes
   errors that are associated with social disapproval as more
   motivationally salient, signaling the need for additional cognitive
   resources to prevent subsequent failures.}},

Abstract = {{Empathy is generally thought of as the ability to share the emotional
   experiences of others. In scientific terms, this is usually
   operationalized as an ability to vicariously feel others' mental and
   emotional experiences. Supporting this account, research demonstrates
   that watching others experience physical pain activates similar brain
   regions to the actual experience of pain itself. First-hand experience
   of social rejection also activates this network. The current work
   extends these findings by examining whether the ``pain{''} network is
   similarly implicated in witnessing rejection, and whether emotional
   closeness modulates this response. We provide evidence for each of these
   suppositions, demonstrating: (a) that the pain network is activated when
   watching a friend suffer social rejection, and (b) that interpersonal
   closeness with that friend modulates this response. Further, we found
   that the inferior frontal gyrus, critical for representing others'
   mental and emotional states, mediates the relationship between emotional
   closeness and neural responses to watching the rejection of a friend.}},

Title = {{Temporal distance insulates against immediate social pain: An NIRS study
   of social exclusion}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{377-387}},
Abstract = {{Social exclusion often evokes social pain in excluded individuals.
   Although this pain can trigger various interpersonal difficulties (e.g.,
   aggression, depression), it is still unclear which psychological
   approach might best help to regulate social pain. However, recent work
   suggests that temporal distance helps to facilitate adaptive coping and
   self-control. The present study measured ventrolateral prefrontal cortex
   (VLPFC) activity during social exclusion, using near-infrared
   spectroscopy (NIRS) to examine the functional relationship between
   ``temporal distance approach,{''} or thinking about the distant future,
   and the social pain regulation process. Participants that imagined the
   distant future, next year, and beyond, felt less social pain and showed
   increased right (r)VLPFC activity during social exclusion, as compared
   to imagining events in the near future, such as tonight and tomorrow.
   Furthermore, rVLPFC activity mediated the relationship between temporal
   distance and social pain. On the basis of these findings, the effect of
   temporal distance on the process of adaptation after social exclusion is
   discussed. It is suggested that temporal distance moderates the process
   of regulating the impact of social exclusion.}},

Title = {{Understanding motor resonance}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{388-397}},
Abstract = {{The discovery of mirror neurons in monkeys, and the finding of motor
   activity during action observation in humans are generally regarded to
   support motor theories of action understanding. These theories take
   motor resonance to be essential in the understanding of observed actions
   and the inference of action goals. However, the notions of
   ``resonance,{''} ``action understanding,{''} and ``action goal{''}
   appear to be used ambiguously in the literature. A survey of the
   literature on mirror neurons and motor resonance yields two different
   interpretations of the term `` resonance,{''} three different
   interpretations of action understanding, and again three different
   interpretations of what the goal of an action is. This entails that,
   unless it is specified what interpretation is used, the meaning of any
   statement about the relation between these concepts can differ to a
   great extent. By discussing an experiment we will show that more precise
   definitions and use of the concepts will allow for better assessments of
   motor theories of action understanding and hence a more fruitful
   scientific debate. Lastly, we will provide an example of how the
   discussed experimental setup could be adapted to test other
   interpretations of the concepts.}},

Title = {{Neural basis of moral verdict and moral deliberation}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{398-413}},
Abstract = {{How people judge something to be morally right or wrong is a fundamental
   question of both the sciences and the humanities. Here we aim to
   identify the neural processes that underlie the specific conclusion that
   something is morally wrong. To do this, we introduce a novel distinction
   between ``moral deliberation,{''} or the weighing of moral
   considerations, and the formation of a `` moral verdict,{''} or the
   commitment to one moral conclusion. We predict and identify hemodynamic
   activity in the bilateral anterior insula and basal ganglia that
   correlates with committing to the moral verdict `` this is morally
   wrong{''} as opposed to `` this is morally not-wrong,{''} a finding that
   is consistent with research from economic decision-making. Using
   comparisons of deliberation-locked vs. verdict-locked analyses, we also
   demonstrate that hemodynamic activity in high-level cortical regions
   previously implicated in morality-including the ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and temporoparietal
   junction-correlates primarily with moral deliberation as opposed to
   moral verdicts. These findings provide new insights into what types of
   processes comprise the enterprise of moral judgment, and in doing so
   point to a framework for resolving why some clinical patients, including
   psychopaths, may have intact moral judgment but impaired moral behavior.}},

Title = {{Comparing social attention in autism and amygdala lesions: Effects of
   stimulus and task condition}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{5-6, SI}},
Pages = {{420-435}},
Abstract = {{The amygdala plays a critical role in orienting gaze and attention to
   socially salient stimuli. Previous work has demonstrated that SM a
   patient with rare bilateral amygdala lesions, fails to fixate and make
   use of information from the eyes in faces. Amygdala dysfunction has also
   been implicated as a contributing factor in autism spectrum disorders
   (ASD), consistent with some reports of reduced eye fixations in ASD.
   Yet, detailed comparisons between ASD and patients with amygdala lesions
   have not been undertaken. Here we carried out such a comparison, using
   eye tracking to complex social scenes that contained faces. We presented
   participants with three task conditions. In the Neutral task,
   participants had to determine what kind of room the scene took place in.
   In the Describe task, participants described the scene. In the Social
   Attention task, participants inferred where people in the scene were
   directing their attention. SM spent less time looking at the eyes and
   much more time looking at the mouths than control subjects, consistent
   with earlier findings. There was also a trend for the ASD group to spend
   less time on the eyes, although this depended on the particular image
   and task. Whereas controls and SM looked more at the eyes when the task
   required social attention, the ASD group did not. This pattern of
   impairments suggests that SM looks less at the eyes because of a failure
   in stimulus-driven attention to social features, whereas individuals
   with ASD look less at the eyes because they are generally insensitive to
   socially relevant information and fail to modulate attention as a
   function of task demands. We conclude that the source of the social
   attention impairment in ASD may arise upstream from the amygdala, rather
   than in the amygdala itself.}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The social motivation hypothesis posits that aberrant neural response to
   human faces in autism is attributable to atypical social development and
   consequently reduced exposure to faces. The specificity of deficits in
   neural specialization remains unclear, and alternative theories suggest
   generalized processing difficulties. The current study contrasted neural
   specialization for social information versus nonsocial information in 36
   individuals with autism and 18 typically developing individuals matched
   for age, race, sex, handedness, and cognitive ability. Event-related
   potentials elicited by faces, inverted faces, houses, letters, and
   pseudoletters were recorded. Groups were compared on an
   electrophysiological marker of neural specialization (N170), as well as
   behavioral performance on standardized measures of face recognition and
   word reading/decoding. Consistent with prior results, individuals with
   autism displayed slowed face processing and decreased sensitivity to
   face inversion; however, they showed comparable brain responses to
   letters, which were associated with behavioral performance in both
   groups. Results suggest that individuals with autism display atypical
   neural specialization for social information but intact specialization
   for nonsocial information. Findings concord with the notion of specific
   dysfunction in social brain systems rather than nonspecific
   information-processing difficulties in autism.}},

Volume = {{6}},

Pages = {{452-463}},
Abstract = {{Several studies have examined facial expression recognition in pervasive
   developmental disorder (PDD), including autism and Asperger's disorder,
   but the results have been inconsistent. We investigated the relationship
   between facial expression recognition and age, face recognition, and
   symptom severity. Subjects were 28 individuals with mild PDD subtypes
   and 28 age- and gender-matched controls. Among six emotions, fearful
   expression recognition was specifically impaired in PDD subjects. Age
   had positive effects on fearful expression recognition directly and
   indirectly via the development of face recognition in controls, but not
   in PDD subjects. Furthermore, fearful expression recognition was related

Abstract = {{Although it has been shown that adults with attention-deficit
   hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have impaired social cognition, no
   previous study has reported the brain correlates of face valence
   processing. This study looked for behavioral, neuropsychological, and
   electrophysiological markers of emotion processing for faces (N170) in
   adult ADHD compared to controls matched by age, gender, educational
   level, and handedness. We designed an event-related potential (ERP)
   study based on a dual valence task (DVT), in which faces and words were
   presented to test the effects of stimulus type (faces, words, or
   face-word stimuli) and valence (positive versus negative). Individual
   signatures of cognitive functioning in participants with ADHD and
   controls were assessed with a comprehensive neuropsychological
   evaluation, including executive functioning (EF) and theory of mind
   (ToM). Compared to controls, the adult ADHD group showed deficits in
   N170 emotion modulation for facial stimuli. These N170 impairments were
   observed in the absence of any deficit in facial structural processing,
   suggesting a specific ADHD impairment in early facial emotion
   modulation. The cortical current density mapping of N170 yielded a main
   neural source of N170 at posterior section of fusiform gyrus (maximum at
   left hemisphere for words and right hemisphere for faces and
   simultaneous stimuli). Neural generators of N170 (fusiform gyrus) were
   reduced in ADHD. In those patients, N170 emotion processing was
   associated with performance on an emotional inference ToM task, and N170
   from simultaneous stimuli was associated with EF, especially working
   memory. This is the first report to reveal an adult ADHD-specific
   impairment in the cortical modulation of emotion for faces and an
   association between N170 cortical measures and ToM and EF.}},

Abstract = {{Successful human interaction is based on correct recognition,
   interpretation, and appropriate reaction to facial affect. In
   depression, social skill deficits are among the most restraining
   symptoms leading to social withdrawal, thereby aggravating social
   isolation and depressive affect. Dysfunctional approach and withdrawal
   tendencies to emotional stimuli have been documented, but the
   investigation of their neural underpinnings has received limited
   attention. We performed an fMRI study including 15 depressive patients
   and 15 matched, healthy controls. All subjects performed two tasks, an
   implicit joystick task as well as an explicit rating task, both using
   happy, neutral, and angry facial expressions. Behavioral data analysis
   indicated a significant group effect, with depressed patients showing
   more withdrawal than controls. Analysis of the functional data revealed
   significant group effects for both tasks. Among other regions, we
   observed significant group differences in amygdala activation, with
   patients showing less response particularly during approach to happy
   faces. Additionally, significant correlations of amygdala activation
   with psychopathology emerged, suggesting that more pronounced symptoms
   are accompanied by stronger decreases of amygdala activation. Hence, our
   results demonstrate that depressed patients show dysfunctional social
   approach and withdrawal behavior, which in turn may aggravate the
   disorder by negative social interactions contributing to isolation and
   reinforcing cognitive biases.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{6}},

Pages = {{502-514}},
Abstract = {{Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative brain disorder that
   affects the frontal and temporal lobes predominantly. Impaired emotion
   recognition has been reported in two FTD subtypes: behavioral-variant
   FTD (bvFTD) and semantic dementia (SD), but has not been investigated in
   the third subtype: progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA).
   Methods: Recognition of six basic facial emotions (anger, disgust, fear,
   sadness, surprise, and happiness) was investigated in 41 FTD patients
   (bvFTD = 16; SD = 12; PNFA = 13) and 37 age-and education-matched
   controls, using two tests. In one task, intensity of emotional
   expression was increased to identify cognitive components contributing
   to emotion recognition performance.
   Results: All patient groups demonstrated impaired overall facial emotion
   recognition compared to controls. Performance, however, improved with
   increased emotion intensity in bvFTD and PNFA groups, the effect of
   intensity on emotion recognition being particularly pronounced for
   negative emotions. In contrast, increased intensity of facial emotion
   did not change performance in SD.
   Conclusions: Patients with SD demonstrate a primary emotion processing
   impairment, whereas PNFA and bvFTD patients' emotional disturbance is in
   part mediated by attentional deficits. These findings indicate that a
   subset of FTD patients may benefit from enhanced emotional intensity
   that will facilitate facial emotion recognition.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental evidence suggests an impairment in emotion perception in

   However, our natural environment is dynamic and multimodal, comprising
   input from various communication channels such as facial expressions,
   emotional prosody, and emotional semantics, to name but a few. Thus, one
   critical open question is whether alterations in emotion perception in
   psychiatric populations are confirmed when testing patients in dynamic
   and multimodal naturalistic settings. Furthermore, the impact task
   demands may exert on results also needs to be reconsidered. Focusing on
   schizophrenia and depression, we review evidence on how emotions are
   perceived from faces and voices in these disorders and examine how
   experimental task demands, stimulus dynamics, and modality may affect

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Most studies investigating emotion recognition in schizophrenia have
   focused on facial expressions and neglected bodily and vocal
   expressions. Furthermore, little is known about affective multisensory
   integration in schizophrenia. In the first experiment, the authors
   investigated recognition of static, face-blurred, whole-body expressions
   (instrumental, angry, fearful, and sad) with a two-alternative,
   forced-choice, simultaneous matching task in a sample of schizophrenia
   patients, nonschizophrenic psychotic patients, and matched controls. In
   the second experiment, dynamic, face-blurred, whole-body expressions
   (fearful and happy) were presented simultaneously with either congruent
   or incongruent human or animal vocalizations to schizophrenia patients
   and controls. Participants were instructed to categorize the emotion
   expressed by the body and to ignore the auditory information. The
   results of Experiment 1 show an emotion recognition impairment in the
   schizophrenia group and to a lesser extent in the nonschizophrenic
   psychosis group, and this for all four expressions. The findings of
   Experiment 2 show that schizophrenia patients are more influenced by the
   auditory information than controls, but only when the auditory
   information consists of human vocalizations. This shows that
   schizophrenia patients are impaired in recognizing whole-body
   expressions, and they show abnormal affective multisensory integration
   of bimodal stimuli originating from the same source.}},

Abstract = {{One of the difficulties facing schizophrenia patients is a failure to
   construct appropriate relationships with others in social situations.
   This impairment of social cognition is also found in autism-spectrum
   disorder (ASD). Considering such commonality between the two disorders,
   in this study we adopted the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) score to
   assess autistic traits, and explored the association between such traits
   and gray matter (GM) alterations of the brain in schizophrenia. Twenty
   schizophrenia patients and 25 healthy controls underwent structural
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and AQ was assessed, comprising five
   subscales measuring different facets of autistic traits. Voxel-based
   morphometry (VBM) was applied to investigate the correlation between
   these AQ scores and regional GM alterations. Schizophrenia patients
   showed significantly higher scores in total AQ, and in four of the five
   subscales, compared to healthy controls. The total AQ score in

Abstract = {{Suspiciousness is a common feature of schizophrenia. However, suspicious
   thoughts are also commonly experienced by the general population. This
   study aimed to examine the underlying neural mechanism of suspicious
   thoughts in individuals with and without schizotypal personality
   disorder (SPD)-proneness, using an event-related potential (ERP)
   paradigm. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded when the ``feeling
   of being seen through{''} was evoked in the participants. The findings
   showed a prominent positive deflection of the difference wave within the
   time window 250-400 ms after stimuli presentation in both SPD-prone and
   non-SPD-prone groups. Furthermore, the P3 amplitude was significantly
   reduced in the SPD-prone group compared to the non-SPD-prone group. The
   current density analysis also indicated hypoactivity in both frontal and
   temporal regions in the SPD-prone group, suggesting that the
   frontotemporal cortical network may play a role in the onset of
   suspicious thoughts. The P3 of difference wave was inversely correlated
   with the cognitive-perception factor and the suspiciousness/paranoid
   ideation trait, which provided preliminary electrophysiological evidence
   for the association of suspiciousness with SPD features.}},

   attribution}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{5-6, SI}},
Pages = {{569-581}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although previous behavioral studies have shown that
   schizophrenia patients have impaired theory of mind (ToM), the neural
   mechanisms associated with this impairment are poorly understood. This
   study aimed to identify the neural mechanisms of ToM in schizophrenia,
   using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a belief
   attribution task.
   Methods: In the scanner, 12 schizophrenia patients and 13 healthy
   control subjects performed the belief attribution task with three
   conditions: a false belief condition, a false photograph condition, and
   a simple reading condition.
   Results: For the false belief versus simple reading conditions,
   schizophrenia patients showed reduced neural activation in areas
   including the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and medial prefrontal
   cortex (MPFC) compared with controls. Further, during the false belief
   versus false photograph conditions, we observed increased activations in
   the TPJ and the MPFC in healthy controls, but not in schizophrenia
   patients. For the false photograph versus simple reading condition, both
   groups showed comparable neural activations.
   Conclusions: Schizophrenia patients showed reduced task-related
   activation in the TPJ and the MPFC during the false belief condition
   compared with controls, but not for the false photograph condition. This
   pattern suggests that reduced activation in these regions is associated
   with, and specific to, impaired ToM in schizophrenia.}},

Title = {{Brain activation during a social attribution task in adolescents with
   moderate to severe traumatic brain injury}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{5-6, SI}},
Pages = {{582-598}},
Abstract = {{The ability to make accurate judgments about the mental states of
   others, sometimes referred to as theory of mind (ToM), is often impaired
   following traumatic brain injury (TBI), and this deficit may contribute
   to problems with interpersonal relationships. The present study used an
   animated social attribution task (SAT) with functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine structures mediating ToM in
   adolescents with moderate to severe TBI. The study design also included
   a comparison group of matched, typically developing (TD) adolescents.
   The TD group exhibited activation within a number of areas that are
   thought to be relevant to ToM, including the medial prefrontal and
   anterior cingulate cortex, fusiform gyrus, and posterior temporal and
   parietal areas. The TBI subjects had significant activation within many
   of these same areas, but their activation was generally more intense and
   excluded the medial prefrontal cortex. Exploratory regression analyses
   indicated a negative relation between ToM-related activation and
   measures of white matter integrity derived from diffusion tensor
   imaging, while there was also a positive relation between activation and
   lesion volume. These findings are consistent with alterations in the
   level and pattern of brain activation that may be due to the combined
   influence of diffuse axonal injury and focal lesions.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic social/emotional deficits are common in moderate to severe

   difficulties. Objective, quantitative tools for assessing
   social/emotional competence are an important adjunct to cognitive
   assessments. We review existing social/emotional measures, conclude that

   competence, and explain the development and piloting of novel measures
   in a small group of moderate to severe TBI patients (N = 16) and
   non-brain-damaged controls (N = 16). The novel measures are the Global
   Interpersonal Skills Test (GIST), a questionnaire measuring
   informant-rated social skills; the Assessment of Social Context (ASC), a
   video-based task examining understanding of others' emotions, attitudes,
   and intentions; the Social Interpretations Test, a social framing task
   based on Heider and Simmel (1944); and Awareness of Interoception, a
   heartbeat-detection paradigm related to physiological self-awareness. In
   a MANOVA, other-rated social skills (GIST), ASC, and Awareness of
   Interoception scores were significantly lower for TBI patients than
   controls. ASC, r(31)=.655, and Social Interpretations, r(31)=.460,
   scores were significantly correlated with informant-rated social skills

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{5-6, SI}},
Pages = {{615-626}},
Abstract = {{Background: Theory of mind (ToM) functioning develops during certain
   phases of childhood. Factors such as language development and
   educational style seem to influence its development. Some studies that
   have focused on transcultural aspects of ToM development have found
   differences between Asian and Western cultures. To date, however, little
   is known about transcultural differences in neural activation patterns
   as they relate to ToM functioning.
   Experimental methods: The aim of our study was to observe ToM
   functioning and differences in brain activation patterns, as assessed by
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This study included a
   sample of 18 healthy Japanese and 15 healthy Caucasian subjects living
   in Japan. We presented a ToM task depicting geometrical shapes moving in
   social patterns. We also administered questionnaires to examine empathy
   abilities and cultural background factors.
   Results: Behavioral data showed no significant group differences in the
   subjects' post-scan descriptions of the movies. The imaging results
   displayed stronger activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) in
   the Caucasian sample during the presentation of ToM videos. Furthermore,
   the task-associated activation of the MPFC was positively correlated
   with autistic and alexithymic features in the Japanese sample.
   Discussion: In summary, our results showed evidence of culturally
   dependent sociobehavioral trait patterns, which suggests that they have
   an impact on brain activation patterns during information processing
   involving ToM.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Psychopathy is a disorder of personality characterized by
   severe impairments of social conduct, emotional experience, and
   interpersonal behavior. Psychopaths consistently violate social norms
   and bring considerable financial, emotional, or physical harm to others
   and to society as a whole. Recent developments in analysis methods of
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), such as voxel-based-morphometry (VBM),
   have become major tools to understand the anatomical correlates of this
   disorder. Nevertheless, the identification of psychopathy by
   neuroimaging or other neurobiological tools (e. g., genetic testing)
   remains elusive.
   Methods/Principal findings: The main aim of this study was to develop an
   approach to distinguish psychopaths from healthy controls, based on the
   integration between pattern recognition methods and gray matter
   quantification. We employed support vector machines (SVM) and maximum
   uncertainty linear discrimination analysis (MLDA), with a
   feature-selection algorithm. Imaging data from 15 healthy controls and
   15 psychopathic individuals (7 women in each group) were analyzed with
   SPM2 and the optimized VBM preprocessing routines. Participants were
   scanned with a 1.5 Tesla MRI system. Both SVM and MLDA achieved an
   overall leave-one-out accuracy of 80\%, but SVM mapping was sparser than
   using MLDA. The superior temporal sulcus/gyrus (bilaterally) was
   identified as a region containing the most relevant information to
   separate the two groups.
   Conclusion/significance: These results indicate that gray matter
   quantitative measures contain robust information to predict high
   psychopathy scores in individual subjects. The methods employed herein
   might prove useful as an adjunct to the established clinical and
   neuropsychological measures in patient screening and diagnostic
   accuracy.}},

Pages = {{640-652}},
Abstract = {{Individuals who engage in corrupt and immoral behavior are in some ways
   similar to individuals with psychopathy. Normal people refrain from
   engaging in such behaviors because they tie together the moral value of
   society and the risk of punishment when they violate social rules. What
   is it, then, that allows these immoral individuals to behave in this
   manner, and in some situations even to prosper? When there is a
   dysfunction of somatic markers, specific disadvantageous impairments in
   decision-making arise, as in moral judgment, but, paradoxically, under
   some circumstances, the damage can cause the patient to make optimal
   financial investment decisions. Interestingly, individuals with
   psychopathy, a personality disorder, share many of the same behavioral
   characteristics seen in VMPFC and amygdala lesion patients, suggesting
   that defective somatic markers may serve as a neural framework for
   explaining immoral and corrupt behaviors. While these sociopathic
   behaviors of sometimes famous and powerful individuals have long been
   discussed, primarily within the realm of social science and psychology,
   here we offer a neurocognitive perspective on the possible neural roots
   of immoral and corrupt behaviors.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{5-6, SI}},
Pages = {{653-662}},
Abstract = {{Apathy, defined as a primary deficit in motivation and manifested by the
   simultaneous diminution in the cognitive and emotional concomitants of
   goal-directed behavior, is a common and debilitating non-motor symptom
   of Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite the high prevalence and clinical
   significance of apathy, little is known about its pathophysiology, and
   in particular how apathy relates to alterations in the neural circuitry
   underpinning the cognitive and emotional components of goal-directed
   behavior. Here, we examined the neural coding of reward cues in patients
   with PD, with or without clinically significant levels of apathy, during
   performance of a spatial search task during (H2O)-O-15 PET (positron
   emission tomography) functional neuroimaging. By manipulating search
   outcome (money reward vs valueless token), while keeping the actions of
   the participants constant, we examined the influence of apathy on the
   neural coding of money reward cues. We found that apathy was associated
   with a blunted response to money in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
   amygdala, striatum, and midbrain, all part of a distributed neural
   circuit integral to the representation of the reward value of stimuli
   and actions, and the influence of reward cues on behavior. Disruption of
   this circuitry potentially underpins the expression of the various
   manifestations of apathy in PD, including reduced cognitive, emotional,
   and behavioral facets of goal-directed behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Socioemotional abnormalities, including decreased social interactions
   and increased self-directed activity, were reported when rhesus monkeys
   with neonatal ablations of either the medial temporal lobe (AH) or the
   inferior temporal cortex (TE) were paired with unoperated peers at two
   and six months of age, though these abnormalities were more severe in
   Group AH (Bachevalier et al., 2001). As adults (Experiment 1), the
   monkeys were re-evaluated in the same dyads and their reactivity to
   novel toys, social status, and reactions to separation were also
   assessed. Group TE now showed only few if any of the abnormal behaviors
   observed in infancy. In contrast, Group AH continued to display
   decreased social interactions and increased self-directed activity and
   showed also increased submission and reduced responses to separation,
   but normal reactivity to novel toys. To determine whether this degree of
   socioemotional impairment was less severe than that produced by the same
   damage in adulthood, we assessed dyadic social interactions of monkeys
   raised until adulthood in laboratory conditions similar to those in
   Experiment 1 and then given the All ablations (Experiment 2). Two months
   postoperatively these monkeys showed a small reduction in social
   interactions that became more pronounced six months postoperatively, yet
   remained less severe than that seen in the infant-lesioned monkeys. No
   other socioemotional effects, except for an increase in food/water
   consumption, were observed. The finding that neonatal AH lesions produce
   more severe socioemotional disturbances than the same lesion in
   adulthood is the reverse of the effect commonly reported for other
   cognitive functions after cerebral damage.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{124}},

Abstract = {{Across a variety of species, the amygdala appears to play a key role in
   the detection and avoidance of potential dangers (e.g., unfamiliar
   social partners, novel objects or contexts, potential predators, etc.).
   For many species, seeking out appropriate food sources and avoiding
   novel, distasteful or potentially tainted food is also a daily concern.
   Amygdala damage in nonhuman primates has been linked to increased
   willingness to select unfamiliar or unpalatable foods, as well as
   inedible items that intact animals typically reject. However, such
   findings have not always been consistent and have typically been
   observed in relatively restrictive, laboratory-based testing contexts.
   We evaluated the food choices of six adult male rhesus monkeys (Macaca
   mulatta) with bilateral, neurotoxic amygdala lesions and six age- and
   experienced-matched unoperated control animals. Each animal was able to
   forage freely in a large enclosure stocked with five preferred and five
   nonpreferred foods that changed locations each day. While both groups
   quickly selected palatable foods, monkeys with amygdala lesions
   consistently selected unpalatable foods that the unoperated control
   animals generally avoided. Even after repeated presentations of the
   unpalatable foods, the amygdala-lesioned monkeys failed to change their
   initial pattern of diminished avoidance. These results are consistent
   with a general role for the amygdala in danger detection and prevention
   of harm in the presence of novel or noxious stimuli, regardless of
   whether such stimuli are conspecifics, predators, objects or foods.}},

Abstract = {{To help elucidate how general the role of dopamine (DA) release in the
   medial preoptic area (mPOA) is for the activation of male sexual
   behavior in vertebrates, we recently developed an in vivo microdialysis
   procedure in the mPOA of Japanese quail. Using these techniques in the
   present experiment, the temporal pattern of DA release in relation to
   the precopulatory exposure to a female and to the expression of both
   appetitive and consummatory aspects of male sexual behavior was
   investigated. Extracellular samples from the mPOA of adult sexually
   experienced male quail were collected every 6 min before, while viewing,
   while in physical contact with, and after exposure to a female. In the
   absence of a precopulatory rise in DA. males failed to copulate when the
   barrier separating them from the female was removed. In contrast, males
   that showed a substantial increase in mPOA DA during precopulatory
   interactions behind the barrier, copulated with females after its
   removal. However, there was no difference in DA during periods when the
   quail were copulating as compared to when the female was present but the
   males were not copulating. In addition, we show that precopulatory DA
   predicts future DA levels and copulatory behavior frequency.
   Furthermore, the size of the cloacal gland, an accurate indicator of
   testosterone action, is positively correlated with precopulatory DA.
   Taken together, these results provide further support for the hypothesis
   that DA action in the mPOA is specifically linked to sexual motivation
   as compared to copulatory behavior per se.}},

Abstract = {{Learning about predictive relationships depends on surprise. For
   example, in Kamin's blocking paradigm learning about the association
   between one stimulus (X) and a footshock is attenuated when X ->
   footshock training occurs in the presence of a good predictor (A) of
   that footshock. Establishing the neural processes that underlie this
   effect has generated considerable interest in recent years. Here, an
   infusion of the dopamine antagonist cis-(z)-Flupenthixol into the
   amygdala prior to compound (AX) conditioning attenuated the blocking
   effect, but had no effect on controls. This effect of dopamine
   antagonism in the amygdala immediately prior to compound conditioning
   was obtained irrespective of whether infusions occurred prior to the
   first, second or both compound conditioning trials. These results
   provide evidence for the involvement of amygdaloid dopamine in
   regulating surprise in fear and therefore predictive learning via a
   direct outcome processing mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing focus on the role of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in
   learning and memory, but there is little consensus as to how the core
   and medial shell subregions of the NAc contribute to these processes. In
   the current experiments, we used spontaneous object recognition to test
   rats with 6-hydroxydopamine lesions targeted at the core or medial shell
   of the NAc on a familiarity discrimination task and a location
   discrimination task. In the object recognition variant, control animals
   were able to discriminate the novel object at both 24-hr and 5-min
   delay. However, in the lesion groups, performance was systematically
   related to dopamine (DA) levels in the core but not the shell. In the
   location recognition task, sham-operated animals readily detected the
   object displacement at test. In the lesion groups, performance
   impairment was systematically related to DA levels in the shell but not
   the core. These results suggest that dopamine function within distinct
   subregions of the NAc plays dissociable roles in the modulation of
   memory for objects and place.}},

Abstract = {{In mammalian species in which the young exhibit a strong filial
   attachment (e.g., monkeys, guinea pigs), numerous studies have shown
   that even brief separation from the attachment figure potently elevates
   circulating concentrations of glucocorticoids and adrenocorticotropic
   hormone (ACTH). However, effects of separation on central regulation of
   this stress response are not known. Therefore, we investigated central
   mechanisms mediating pituitary-adrenal activation during maternal
   separation and novelty exposure in guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) pups.
   Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) mRNA expression in the hypothalamic
   paraventricular nucleus (PVN), and plasma cortisol and ACTH levels, were
   elevated only during separation in a novel environment. C-Fos activity
   was elevated in the medial amygdala (MeA) and reduced in the bed nucleus
   of the stria terminalis (BNST) during novelty exposure, regardless of
   separation. On the other hand, c-Fos activity was elevated in the PVN
   during separation, regardless of novelty exposure. These results
   demonstrate independent and combined effects of separation and novelty
   in regions of the guinea pig CNS that regulate pituitary-adrenal
   activity. Moreover, they suggest that a pathway from MeA to BNST to PVN
   mediates responses to novelty in the guinea pig pup, as in the adult
   rat, though inputs from other cell populations appear required to fully
   account for the HPA activity observed here.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure to stress reliably activates the hypothalamo pituitary
   adrenocortical (HPA) axis response in rodents, which is significantly
   reduced (habituated) following repeated exposures. In the current study,
   it was first established that HPA axis response habituation to repeated
   loud noise lasted for at least 4 weeks in rats. In the next experiment,
   a contextual extinction procedure following repeated loud noise
   exposures failed to restore the habituated HPA axis response. Although
   an additional study indicated some recovery of responses when the
   context was modified on a test day following habituation, this effect
   could be mostly attributed to the familiarity with the contextual cues.
   A final study confirmed that rats could distinguish between the contexts
   used and further indicated that context preexposures reduce acute HPA
   axis responses to loud noise. These studies therefore provide no support
   for the hypothesis that contextual cues regulate HPA axis response
   habituation.}},

Abstract = {{Detection of light in the eye underlies image-forming vision, but also
   regulates adaptive responses in physiology and behavior. Typically these
   adaptive responses do not involve image-forming vision, but depend on a
   relatively absolute measure of brightness (nonimage-forming irradiance
   detection). The goal of this study was to further understand how
   image-forming vision and nonimage-forming irradiance detection
   contribute to the effects of light on behavior. Three light dependent
   behaviors were assessed in wild-type, Rpe65-/- and rd1 mice. In Rpe65-/-
   mice, nonimage-forming irradiance detection is severely attenuated, but
   rod based visual acuity is relatively preserved. In rd1 mice visual
   acuity is nonrecordable, but nonimage-forming responses are less
   severely attenuated than Rpe65-/-. Positive masking, an image-forming
   vision dependent increase in wheel running, was absent in rd1 and
   restricted to higher irradiances in Rpe65-/-. Negative masking, a
   suppression of wheel running sensitivity with nonimage-forming
   irradiance detection input, was increased in rd1, but reduced in
   Rpe65-/- mice. By contrast, light aversion, an avoidance of brightly lit
   areas, was abolished in both Rpe65-/- and rd1. This shows that
   image-forming vision is not sufficient for light aversion, suggesting
   nonimage-forming irradiance detection motivates this behavior. Further,
   the differing effects of disease suggest that negative masking and light
   aversion are distinct responses with specialized nonimage-forming
   irradiance detection pathways.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have demonstrated that the galanin system modulates
   responses to drugs of abuse such as morphine. The current study examined
   whether genetic deletion of galanin could affect the locomotor and
   reinforcing effects of cocaine in mice. We analyzed spontaneous motor
   activity and cocaine-induced hyperactivity in wild-type (GAL-WT) and
   knockout mice lacking galanin (GAL-KO) maintained on the 129/O1aHsd
   background. Our results indicate that cocaine enhanced locomotion
   (defined as moving more than 5 cm) dose-dependently in GAL-WT and GAL-KO
   mice. However, general activity (total beam breaks) was increased by
   cocaine only in GAL-WT mice. An additional experiment indicated that
   galnon, a nonselective galanin receptor agonist, did not affect
   cocaine-induced hyperactivity. In a second set of experiments, mice of
   both genotypes were trained to self-administer cocaine under a fixed
   ratio schedule, tested with various doses of cocaine and under different
   schedules of reinforcement. This set of experiments showed that cocaine
   self-administration did not differ markedly between genotypes. However,
   while GAL-WT mice acquired cocaine self-administration, a median split
   analysis showed that mice could be divided into large and small drug
   takers, whereas all GAL-KO mice behaved as small drug takers. Our
   results indicate that wild-type and galanin knockout mice on a congenic
   129/O1aHsd background are responsive to the locomotor effects of cocaine
   and can acquire intravenous cocaine self-administration. However, the
   phenotype observed in GAL-KO mice does not support a major role for
   galanin in cocaine-induced hyperlocomotion and self-administration.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic deletion of glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) in forebrain neurons
   gives rise to multiple-procognitive phenotypes, presumably due to
   enhanced N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) functions. However,
   concerns over possible harmful excitotoxic effects under lifelong
   elevation of synaptic glycine have been raised. Such effects might
   accelerate the aging process, weakening or even reversing the
   procognitive phenotypes identified in adulthood. Here, we examined if
   one of the most robust phenotypes in the mutant mouse line (CamKIl alpha
   Cre,GlyT1tm1.2fl/fl), namely, enhanced aversive Pavlovian conditioning,
   might be modified by age. Comparison between 3-month-old (adult) and
   22-month-old (aged) mutants confirmed the presence of this phenotype at
   both ages. However, the temporal expression of the Pavlovian phenotype
   was modified in senescence; while adult mutants showed a pronounced
   within-session extinction, aged mutants did not. Expression of NR2B
   subunits of NMDAR and neural proliferation were examined in the same
   animals by immunohistochemistry. These were reduced in the aged mice as
   expected, but not exacerbated by the mutation. Thus, our results do not
   substantiate the concerns of neurotoxic effects through lifelong GlyT1
   disruption in forebrain neurons, but provide evidence for a modification
   of phenotypic expression as a function of age. The latter points to the
   need to further investigate other precognitive phenotypes identified at
   adulthood in this mutant line. In addition, we revealed here for the
   first time a clear increase in the number of immature neurons in the
   hippocampus of the mutants, although the behavioral significance of this
   phenotype remains to be determined.}},

Abstract = {{Reaching movements of the arm and hand become automatic early in
   development and are used throughout one's life span. Studies on skilled
   reaching have focused on the kinematic aspects and have advanced our
   knowledge of the individual motor components of reaching. It has also
   been shown that motor behaviors are organized in terms of ethologically
   relevant actions, rather than by motor components. Thus, it is important
   to analyze how the motor components of reaching are performed within the
   overall action as a whole. The objective of the present study was to
   examine the motor components of reaching-to-eat within the context of
   the overall behavior in stroke participants. Results show that
   reaching-to-eat involves the whole body to produce isolated actions of
   the limb and changes after stroke in three fundamental ways: abnormal
   use of nonkinematic aspects of movement, body-limb disintegration, and a
   disruption in the temporal aspect of the phases of reaching-to-eat. The
   movements within the behavior can reorganize, possibly a reflection of
   dynamic interactions between behavioral compensation and
   neuroplasticity, while the overall performance of the behavior remains
   the same. Such subtle flexibility may be part of the process of
   recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies indicate that physical exercise improves contextual
   fear memory, as evidenced by increased freezing behavior when rats are
   returned to a training environment that was initially paired with
   footshock. However, freezing behavior could also be affected by fatigue,
   especially because rats were tested shortly after the end of the dark
   cycle, which is when most wheel running was likely to occur. In
   addition, exercise has been shown to have anxiolytic effects, further
   confounding interpretation of the effects of exercise on cognition when
   using aversive conditioning tasks. These factors were examined in the
   present study by comparing freezing behavior in exercising and
   nonexercising rats that were tested at different times in the light
   cycle. In addition, all rats were tested on an elevated plus maze to
   assess anxiety-like behavior and in an open-field apparatus to measure
   locomotor activity in order to directly examine interactions between
   freezing, anxiety-like behavior, and locomotion. Consistent with prior
   studies, exercising rats exhibited more context freezing than did
   sedentary rats when tested early in the light cycle. However, the
   opposite pattern of results was obtained when testing occurred late in
   the light cycle, an effect driven by a difference in the amount of
   freezing exhibited by the sedentary control groups. Indeed, the levels
   of context freezing exhibited by exercising rats were comparable
   regardless of when the rats were tested during the light cycle. These
   data have implications for interpreting the effects of exercise on
   aversive conditioning.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we compared the effects of using neutral face masks vs

   Twenty-seven subjects viewed 18 s blocks of either fearful or happy
   faces masked with either neutral faces or patterns, while their brain
   activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   Results replicated increased amygdala activation to face-masked fearful
   vs happy faces. In the pattern mask condition, the amygdala
   discriminated between masked fearful and happy faces, but this effect
   manifested as a decrease in activation to fearful faces compared to
   happy faces. This interactive effect between facial expression and mask
   stimulus shows that amygdala responses to masked fearful faces are
   influenced by the fearful stimuli per se as well as their interaction
   with the mask stimulus.}},

Abstract = {{The regulation of negative emotion through reappraisal has been shown to
   induce increased prefrontal activity and decreased amygdala activity.
   Individual differences in dispositional mindfulness reflect differences
   in typical recognition, detachment and regulation of current experience,
   thought to also operate as top-down control mechanism. We sought to
   investigate whether such individual differences would be associated with
   brain activity elicited during reappraisal of negative emotion. Eighteen
   healthy participants completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging
   task that involved attending to or reappraising negative stimuli, and
   provided emotion experience ratings after each trial. Dispositional
   mindfulness was assessed with a self-report questionnaire. Reappraisal
   induced activity in a brain network involving predominantly dorsal
   portions of the prefrontal cortex, replicating previous studies. A
   voxelwise regression analysis showed that individual differences in the
   tendency to be mindful predicted activity in neural regions underlying
   reappraisal, with dorsomedial prefrontal cortex activation increasing
   with more mindfulness traits. Notably, this prefrontal activation was
   inversely correlated with the amygdala response to negative scenes,
   further supporting its role in down-regulating emotion-generation
   regions. These findings suggest that individual differences in
   dispositional mindfulness, which reflect the tendency to recognize and
   regulate current states, may modulate activity in neural systems
   involved in the effective cognitive control of negative emotion.}},

Abstract = {{Moral judgment is an evaluation of the actions and character of a person
   made with respect to societal norms. Although many types of vignettes
   have been used in previous studies on moral beliefs and judgment, what
   is missing is a set of standardized common vignettes based in real life.
   The goal of this study was to provide researchers with stimuli that have
   values on several dimensions pertaining to moral judgment and whose
   underlying components are known. These values will allow researchers to
   select stimuli based on standardized ratings rather than on the results
   of pilot studies, while avoiding the limitations of the classic,
   abstract moral scenarios. Our study was composed of three phases, (i)
   collecting and shortening the vignettes, (ii) obtaining ratings of the
   vignettes on several dimensions including emotional intensity, degree of
   social norm violation, and level of harm or benefit caused and (iii)
   determining the underlying components of the vignettes by performing a
   factor analysis. We found three components that accounted for most of
   the variance: norm violation, social affect and intention. The resulting
   vignettes can be used in future parametric studies on moral judgment in
   behavioral, neuropsychological and functional imaging experiments.}},

Abstract = {{According to sociometer theory, self-esteem serves as a barometer of the
   extent to which individuals are socially included or excluded by others.
   We hypothesized that trait self-esteem would be related to social pain
   responsiveness, and we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to
   experimentally investigate this potential relationship. Participants (n
   = 26) performed a cyberball task, a computerized game of catch during
   which the participants were excluded from the game. Participants then
   rated the degree of social pain experienced during both inclusion in and
   exclusion from the game. Individuals with lower trait self-esteem
   reported increased social pain relative to individuals with higher trait
   self-esteem, and such individuals also demonstrated a greater degree of
   dorsal anterior cingulate cortex activation. A psychophysiological
   interaction analysis revealed a positive connectivity between the dorsal
   anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortices for the lower trait
   self-esteem group, and a corresponding negative connectivity for the
   higher trait self-esteem group. Heightened dorsal anterior cortex
   activity and a corresponding connection with the prefrontal cortex might
   be one possible explanation for the greater levels of social pain
   observed experienced by individuals with low trait self-esteem.}},

Abstract = {{Mentalization is the process by which an observer views a target as
   possessing higher cognitive faculties such as goals, intentions and
   desires. Mentalization can be assessed using action identification
   paradigms, in which observers choose mentalistic (goals-focused) or
   mechanistic (action-focused) descriptions of targets' actions. Neural
   structures that play key roles in inferring goals and intentions from
   others' observed or imagined actions include temporo-parietal junction,
   ventral premotor cortex and extrastriate body area. We hypothesized that
   these regions play a role in action identification as well. Data
   collected using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) confirmed
   our predictions that activity in ventral premotor cortex and middle
   temporal gyrus near the extrastriate body area varies both as a function
   of the valence of the target and the extent to which actions are
   identified as goal-directed. In addition, the inferior parietal lobule
   is preferentially engaged when participants identify the actions of
   mentalized targets. Functional connectivity analyses suggest support
   from other regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala,
   during mentalization. We found correlations between action
   identification and Autism Quotient scores, suggesting that understanding
   the neural correlates of action identification may enhance our
   understanding of the underpinnings of essential social cognitive
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{Using moral dilemmas, we (i) investigate whether stereotypes motivate
   people to value ingroup lives over outgroup lives and (ii) examine the
   neurobiological correlates of relative social valuation using fMRI.
   Saving ingroup members, who seem warm and competent (e.g. Americans),
   was most morally acceptable in the context of a dilemma where one person
   was killed to save five people. Extreme outgroup members, who seem
   neither warm nor competent (e.g. homeless), were the worst off; it was
   most morally acceptable to sacrifice them and least acceptable to save
   them. Sacrificing these low-warmth, low-competence targets to save
   ingroup targets, specifically, activated a neural network associated
   with resolving complex tradeoffs: medial PFC (BA 9, extending caudally
   to include ACC), left lateral OFC (BA 47) and left dorsolateral PFC (BA
   10). These brain regions were recruited for dilemmas that participants
   ultimately rated as relatively more acceptable. We propose that
   participants, though ambivalent, overrode general aversion to these
   tradeoffs when the cost of sacrificing a low-warmth, low-competence
   target was pitted against the benefit of saving ingroup targets. Moral
   decisions are not made in a vacuum; intergroup biases and stereotypes
   weigh heavily on neural systems implicated in moral decision making.}},

   intentionality considerations. In this functional magnetic resonance
   imaging study, we investigated the neural correlates of fairness by
   focusing on responder behavior to unfair offers in an Ultimatum Game
   paradigm with conditions that differed in their intentionality
   constraints. Brain activity underlying rejection vs acceptance of unfair
   offers appeared highly dependent on intentionality. Rejection of unfair
   offers when the proposer had no-alternative as well as acceptance of
   offers when the proposer had a fair- or hyperfair-alternative was
   associated with activation in a network of regions including the insula
   and the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex. These activations were
   interpreted as neural responses to norm violations because they were
   mostly involved when behavior was inconsistent with socially accepted
   behavior patterns. Rejection of unfair offers in the no-alternative
   condition further resulted in activity in the anterior medial prefrontal
   cortex and the temporoparietal junction, which was interpreted in terms
   of higher moral mentalizing demands required in social decision-making
   when rejection could not be readily justified. Together, results
   highlight the significance of intentionality considerations in
   fairness-related social decision-making processes.}},

Abstract = {{Research into the neural underpinnings of fear and fear-related
   pathology has highlighted the role of the amygdala. For instance,
   bilateral damage to the amygdaloid complex is associated with decreased
   appreciation of danger and recognition of fear in humans, whereas
   enlarged amygdala volume is associated with internalizing syndromes. It
   is unknown whether amygdala volume and fearfulness are related in the
   absence of pathology. We examined the correlation between normal
   fearfulness and amygdala morphology in 116 healthy children and
   adolescents (60 boys, 56 girls, age 7-17 years). Fearfulness was
   measured using the parent ratings on the Pediatric Behavior Scale and
   amygdala volumes were determined by manual tracing. We found a positive
   correlation between right amygdala volume in girls (r = 0.29). This
   relationship was more robust and present bilaterally when analyses were
   limited to girls with a positive nuclear family history of depression
   (for left r = 0.63; for right r = 0.58). In boys there was no
   significant relationship which may suggest that biological mechanisms
   differ between sexes. Given the role of enlarged amygdala volume in
   pathology, these findings may indicate that variation in amygdala
   morphology marks susceptibility to internalizing disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Perception of both gaze-direction and symbolic directional cues (e.g.
   arrows) orient an observer's attention toward the indicated location. It
   is unclear, however, whether these similar behavioral effects are
   examples of the same attentional phenomenon and, therefore, subserved by
   the same neural substrate. It has been proposed that gaze, given its
   evolutionary significance, constitutes a `special' category of spatial
   cue. As such, it is predicted that the neural systems supporting spatial
   reorienting will be different for gaze than for non-biological symbols.
   We tested this prediction using functional magnetic resonance imaging to
   measure the brain's response during target localization in which
   laterally presented targets were preceded by uninformative gaze or arrow
   cues. Reaction times were faster during valid than invalid trials for
   both arrow and gaze cues. However, differential patterns of activity
   were evoked in the brain. Trials including invalid rather than valid
   arrow cues resulted in a stronger hemodynamic response in the ventral
   attention network. No such difference was seen during trials including
   valid and invalid gaze cues. This differential engagement of the ventral
   reorienting network is consistent with the notion that the facilitation
   of target detection by gaze cues and arrow cues is subserved by
   different neural substrates.}},

Abstract = {{Normal aging is associated with impairments in stimulus recognition In
   the current investigation, object recognition was tested in adult and
   aged rats with the standard spontaneous object recognition (SOR) task or
   two variants of this task On the standard SOR task, adult rats showed an
   exploratory preference for the novel object over delays up to 24 h,
   whereas the aged rats only showed significant novelty discrimination at
   the 2-min delay This age difference appeared to be because of the old
   rats behaving as if the novel object was familiar To test this
   hypothesis directly, rats participated in a variant of the SOR task that
   allowed the exploration times between the object familiarization and the
   test phases to be compared. and this experiment confirmed that aged rats
   falsely ``recognize{''} the novel object A final control examined
   whether or not aged rats exhibited reduced motivation to explore objects
   In this experiment. when the environmental context changed between
   familiarization and test, young and old rats failed to show an
   exploratory preference because both age groups spent more time exploring
   the familiar object Together these findings support the view that
   age-related impairments in object recognition arise from old animals
   behaving as if novel objects are familiar, which is reminiscent of
   behavioral impairments in young rats with perirhnal cortical lesions The
   current experiments thus suggest that alterations in the perirhinal
   cortex may be responsible for reducing aged animals' ability to
   distinguish new stimuli from ones that have been encountered previously}},

Abstract = {{Transecting the corpus callosum of postnatal day (P)1-6 rats disinhibits
   the production of spindle bursts (SBs) within primary somatosensory
   cortex (SI). most notably during periods of sleep-related myoclonic
   twitching Here we investigated developmental changes in this callosally
   mediated disinhibition and its association with cortical plasticity
   Recordings in P2-15 subjects revealed that callosotomy-induced
   disinhibition is a transient feature of early development that
   disappears abruptly after P6 This abrupt switch was accompanied by sharp
   decreases in myoclonic twitching and equally sharp increases in
   spontaneous SBs and in the number of GABAergic and glutamatergic
   presynaptic terminals in SI Expression of the K+Cl- cotransporter 2
   (KCC2) also increased across these ages To determine whether these
   developmental changes are associated with alterations in cortical
   plasticity, pups were callosotomized at P1, P6, or P8, and tested over
   the subsequent week Regardless of age, callosotomy immediately disrupted
   SBs evoked by forepaw stimulation Over the next week, the PI and P6
   callosotomy groups exhibited full recovery of function, in contrast, the
   P8 group did not exhibit recovery of function, thus indicating an abrupt
   decrease in cortical plasticity between P6 and P8 Together, our data
   demonstrate that callosotomy-induced disinhibition is a transient
   phenomenon whose disappearance coincides with the onset of increased
   intrinsic connectivity, establishment of excitatory-inhibitory balance,
   and diminished plasticity in SI Accordingly, our findings indicate that
   callosotomy-induced disinhibition of twitch-related SBs is a bioassay of
   somatosensory cortical plasticity and, in addition, support the
   hypothesis that myoclonic twitches, like retinal waves, actively
   contribute to conical development and plasticity}},

Abstract = {{Although there are many studies investigating the effects of early
   cortical injury on brain and behavioral development in laboratory
   animals, there are virtually no studies examining the effects of
   cortical injury in adolescence The purpose of present study was to
   investigate the effects of unilateral motor cortex lesion received in
   early and late adolescence periods (Postnatal days 35 and 55 {[}P35,
   P55]) on spontaneous neural reorganization and behavioral recovery in
   adulthood Rats were given unilateral motor cortex lesions at P35 or P55
   and their motor behaviors were compared to sham controls in adulthood
   The results of behavioral tests (skilled reaching. postural asymmetry,
   sunflower seed manipulation. forepaw inhibition in swimming) revealed
   that rats with P35 lesions had significant functional deficits whereas
   the rats with P55 lesions showed nearly complete recovery Golgi-Cox
   analysis of pyramidal neurons showed bilateral hypertrophy of dendritic
   fields in the remaining sensorimotor cortex in P55 but not P35 rat
   brains Thus, there appears to be an age-related pattern of morphological
   and behavioral changes in response to cortical injury in the early and
   late adolescent periods leading to better functional recovery from later
   injuries, much as is seen in human children}},

   AAS-Induced Aggression Through D2 but Not D5 Receptors}},

Abstract = {{Treatment with anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) throughout adolescence
   facilitates offensive aggression in Syrian hamsters. In the anterior
   hypothalamus (AH), the dopaminergic neural system undergoes alterations
   after repeated exposure to AAS, producing elevated aggression.
   Previously, systemic administration of selective dopamine receptor
   antagonists has been shown to reduce aggression in various species and
   animal models. However, these reductions in aggression occur with
   concomitant alterations in general arousal and mobility. Therefore, to
   control for these systemic effects, the current studies utilized
   microinjection techniques to determine the effects of local antagonism
   of D2 and D5 receptors in the AH on adolescent AAS-induced aggression.
   Male Syrian hamsters were treated with AAS throughout adolescence and
   tested for aggression after local infusion of the D2 antagonist
   eticlopride, or the D5 antagonist SCH-23390, into the AH. Treatment with
   eticlopride showed dose-dependent suppression of aggressive behavior in
   the absence of changes in mobility. Conversely, while injection of
   SCH-23390 suppressed aggressive behavior, these reductions were met with
   alterations in social interest and locomotor behavior. To elucidate a
   plausible mechanism for the observed D5 receptor mediation of
   AAS-induced aggression, brains of AAS and sesame oil-treated animals
   were processed for double-label immunofluorescence of GAD(67) (a marker
   for GABA production) and D5 receptors in the lateral subdivision of the
   AH (LAH). Results indicate a sparse distribution of GAD67 neurons
   colocalized with D5 receptors in the LAH. Together, these results
   indicate that D5 receptors in the LAH modulate non-GABAergic pathways
   that indirectly influence aggression control, while D2 receptors have a
   direct influence on AAS-induced aggression.}},

Abstract = {{We have previously shown that nicotine enhances learning in a negative
   occasion setting task in which rats are trained to distinguish between
   two different trial types. During reinforced trials, a target stimulus
   (a tone) is presented and immediately followed by food reward. On
   nonreinforced trials, a feature stimulus (a light) is presented prior to
   the tone and indicates the absence of reward following presentation of
   the tone. The goal of the present study was to identify the behavioral
   mechanism through which nicotine affects this form of learning, and to
   determine which subtype(s) of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors mediate
   the effects of nicotine. Consistent with our prior findings, nicotine
   administration enhanced the ability of rats to discriminate between the
   two trial types. Nicotine enhanced the magnitude of the discrimination
   by decreasing responding to the tone on nonreinforced trials.
   Nicotine-treated rats also learned the discrimination in fewer sessions
   than control rats. A significant new finding was that nicotine also
   increased the orienting response to the light, suggesting that nicotine
   may enhance learning the serial feature negative discrimination by
   increasing attention to the visual feature. In addition, we found that
   RJR-2403, a selective alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic receptor agonist, also
   enhanced discrimination. However, RJR-2403 did not affect responding on
   nonreinforced trials, nor did RJR-2403 affect orienting to the light.
   Together these data indicate that nicotine may enhance discrimination by
   enhancing tone-reward associability through alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic
   receptors and by enhancing attention to the light through non-alpha 4
   beta 2 receptor subtypes.}},

Abstract = {{3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ``ecstasy{''}) is a
   psychoactive drug structurally related to other phenylisopropylamines
   acting as stimulants or hallucinogens in humans. Although MDMA has a
   pharmacological identity of its own, the distinction of its acute
   effects from those of stimulants or even hallucinogens is controversial.
   In this work, dose-response curves (0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 10 mg/kg)
   representing the acute in vivo effects of MDMA were compared with those
   of a structurally related stimulant (methamphetamine, MA) and a
   hallucinogenic analogue (2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine, DOI) in a set
   of behavioral protocols in rats, including spontaneous psychomotor
   activity, anxiolytic/anxiogenic-like effects and active avoidance
   conditioning responses. The behavioral profiles obtained allowed us to
   differentiate among racemic MDMA. MA, and DOI at different dose ranges.
   In addition, the evaluation of four MDMA analogues (1, 5, and 10 mg/kg)
   comprising two well-known MDMA analogues (MDA
   {[}3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine] and MDE (N-ethyl-MDA, believed to
   substitute for MDMA) and two other structural analogues (MDOH
   {[}N-hydroxy-MDA] and MMDA-2
   {[}2-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyamphetamine]) showed that none of these
   exactly resembles MDMA in their pharmacological profiles, highlighting
   the unique character of this prototypical entactogen. In fact, their
   effects exhibited similarities with the behavioral profiles of either MA
   or DO!, as well as novel profiles in specific behavioral paradigms.}},

Abstract = {{Oxytocin (Oxt) and the Oxt receptor (Oxtr) are implicated in the onset
   of maternal behavior in a variety of species. Recently, we developed two
   Oxtr knockout lines: a total body knockout (Oxtr(-/-)) and a conditional
   Oxtr knockout (Oxtr(FB/FR)) in which the Oxtr is lacking only in regions
   of the forebrain, allowing knockout females to potentially nurse and
   care for their biological offspring. In the current study, we assessed
   maternal behavior of postpartum Oxtr(FB/FB) females toward their own
   pups and maternal behavior of virgin Oxtr(-/-) females toward foster
   pups and compared knockouts of both lines to wildtype (Oxtr(+/+))
   littermates. We found that both Oxtr(-/-) and Oxtr(FB/FB) females appear
   to have largely normal maternal behaviors. However, with first litters,
   approximately 40\% of the Oxtr(FB/FB) knockout dams experienced high pup
   mortality, compared to fewer than 10\% of the Oxtr(+/+) dams. We then
   went on to test whether or not this phenotype occurred in subsequent
   litters or when the dams were exposed to an environmental disturbance.
   We found that regardless of the degree of external disturbance,
   Oxtr(FB/FB) females lost more pups on their first and second litters
   compared to wildtype females. Possible reasons for higher pup mortality
   in Oxtr(FB/FB) females are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual behavior is a natural reward that activates striatal dopaminergic
   (DA) circuits, and dopamine exerts a facilitative influence on
   copulation. Electrical stimulation of the striatum has been shown to be
   rewarding, but its effect on male sexual behavior display has not been
   established. The objective of the present work was to assess the effects
   of low- and high-frequency electrical stimulation of the dorsal and
   ventral striatum on male rat sexual behavior expression. To this aim,
   copulatory activity of sexually experienced male rats was recorded
   during electrical stimulation of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) or
   caudate-putamen (CP), at each stimulation frequency, before and after
   sexual exhaustion. Results showed that electrical stimulation of the
   NAcc at both frequencies increased the number of ejaculations that male
   rats were able to show in a 30-min period. By contrast, stimulation
   delivered to the CP inhibited sexual behavior by slowing its display.
   Each effect was more pronounced at low than at high stimulation
   frequencies. In the same rats, once sexually exhausted, electrical
   stimulation of these brain areas did not reverse the sexual behavior
   inhibition that characterizes the sexual exhaustion state. It is
   concluded that dorsal and ventral striatal DA brain regions exert
   opposite influences on copulatory behavior expression of sexually
   experienced male rats. Also, that the facilitative effect of NAcc
   electrical stimulation on sexual activity, with the stimulation
   parameters used, cannot surmount the sexual behavior inhibition
   resulting from copulation to satiation.}},

Abstract = {{Animal studies suggest that structural changes occur in the maternal
   brain during the early postpartum period in regions such as the
   hypothalamus, amygdala, parietal lobe, and prefrontal cortex and such
   changes are related to the expression of maternal behaviors. In an
   attempt to explore this in humans, we conducted a prospective
   longitudinal study to examine gray matter changes using voxel-based
   morphometry on high resolution magnetic resonance images of mothers'
   brains at two time points: 2-4 weeks postpartum and 3-4 months
   postpartum. Comparing gray matter volumes across these two time points,
   we found increases in gray matter volume of the prefrontal cortex,
   parietal lobes, and midbrain areas. Increased gray matter volume in the
   midbrain including the hypothalamus, substantia nigra. and amygdala was
   associated with maternal positive perception of her baby. These results
   suggest that the first months of motherhood in humans are accompanied by
   structural changes in brain regions implicated in maternal motivation
   and behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{The gustatory rejection response of the cabbage looper. Trichoplusia ni
   (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), habituates to antifeedant compounds, allowing
   for the consumption of deterrent yet nontoxic plant materials. In the
   present study, we demonstrate that habituation to an antifeedant
   compound (quinine) persists through the moult between larval instars. As
   an indirect test of whether the memory was protein synthesis-dependent,
   we tested whether disrupting protein synthesis would block memory
   reconsolidation after a reminder. The results indicated that disrupting
   protein synthesis in habituated larvae following a reminder treatment
   (reexposure to quinine) eliminated the memory for habituation and
   restored the antifeedant properties of the quinine. We then examined
   whether the learned memory could be dishabituated and whether this would
   disrupt or eliminate long-term memory. We show that 6 hr after exposure
   to a novel/noxious stimulus (a second antifeedent, xanthotoxin)
   habituated larvae showed a transient dishabituation-like effect in which
   the quinine deterred feeding again. However, this effect did not
   permanently eliminate the habituation produced by the extended exposure
   as larvae tested 72 hr after xanthotoxin exposure again showed a
   willingness to consume the quinine treated leaves, indicating that the
   earlier habituation was still present.}},

Abstract = {{The role of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in contextual fear
   conditioning (CFC) is debated. Several studies demonstrated that
   blocking adult hippocampal neurogenesis in rodents impairs CFC, while
   several other studies failed to observe an impairment. We sought to
   determine whether different CFC methods vary in their sensitivity to the
   arrest of adult neurogenesis. Adult neurogenesis was arrested in mice
   using low-dose, targeted x-irradiation, and the effects of irradiation
   were assayed in conditioning procedures that varied in the use of a
   discrete conditioned stimulus, the number of trials administered, and
   the final level of conditioning produced. We demonstrate that
   irradiation impairs CFC in mice when a single-trial CFC procedure is
   used but not when multiple-trial procedures are used, regardless of the
   final level of contextual fear produced. In addition, we show that the
   irradiation-induced deficit in single-trial CFC can be rescued by
   providing preexposure to the conditioning context. These results
   indicate that adult hippocampal neurogenesis is required for CFC in mice
   only when brief training is provided.}},

Abstract = {{Offensive aggression in golden hamsters is inhibited by
   5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(1A) receptors and facilitated by 5-HT(3)
   receptor activation. As such, we sought to determine whether these
   receptors function similarly between animals expressing an
   impulsive-aggressive phenotype, as compared to normal animals. Animals
   were screened for aggressive and impulsive choice behaviors and
   categorized into Low-Aggression (L-Agg) and High-Aggression (H-Agg)
   groups, and then tested for behavior under effective doses of 5-HT(1A)
   receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-N, N-dipropyl-2-aminotetralin (DPAT; 0.1
   mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg) or 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist tropisetron (0.3
   mg/kg) treatment. Low-dose DPAT treatment inhibited both behaviors in
   H-Agg animals, however yielding more modest effects in L-Agg animals;
   while high-dose DPAT effects were confounded by side effects on
   locomotion. Tropisetron, on the other hand, had differential effects
   between groups, as aggression and impulsive choice were both inhibited
   in H-Age animals, while enhanced in L-Agg individuals. In addition,
   while the effects of the 5-HT(A1) receptor were limited, the broad
   effects of 5-HT(3) receptor included repetitive and impulsive elements
   of behavior, pointing to the importance of the receptor's role in the
   modulation of these particular aspects within the phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{Cocaine use is associated with high levels of impulsive choice
   (preference for immediate over delayed rewards), but it is not clear
   whether cocaine use causes elevated impulsive choice, or whether
   elevated impulsive choice is solely a predisposing factor for cocaine
   use. This study examined the effects of prior cocaine
   self-administration on rats performing a delay discounting task commonly
   used to measure impulsive choice. Male Long-Evans rats were implanted
   with intravenous catheters, and following recovery, were trained to
   self-administer 30 mg/kg/day cocaine HCl (approx. 0.5 mg/kg/infusion)
   for 14 consecutive clays (a control group received yoked intravenous
   saline infusions). Following three weeks of withdrawal, all rats were
   food-restricted and began training on the delay discounting task in
   standard operant chambers. On each trial, rats were given a choice
   between two levers. A press on one lever delivered a small food reward
   immediately, and a press on the other delivered a large food reward
   after a variable delay period. Rats that self-administered cocaine
   displayed greater impulsive choice (enhanced preference for the small
   immediate over the large delayed reward, as reflected by shorter
   indifference points) compared to controls, but were no different from
   controls on a ``probabilistic discounting{''} task in which they chose
   between small certain and large uncertain rewards. These data suggest
   that self-administered cocaine can cause lasting elevations in impulsive
   choice, and that the high levels of impulsive choice observed in human
   cocaine users may be due in part to long-term effects of cocaine on
   brain function.}},

Abstract = {{In Pavlovian fear conditioning, an aversive unconditional stimulus (UCS)
   is repeatedly paired with a neutral conditional stimulus (CS). As a
   consequence, the subject begins to show conditional responses (CRs) to
   the CS that indicate expectation and fear. There are currently two
   general models competing to explain the role of subjective awareness in
   fear conditioning. Proponents of the single-process model assert that a
   single propositional learning process mediates CR expression and UCS
   expectancy. Proponents of a dual-process model assert that these
   behavioral responses are expressions of two independent learning
   processes. We used backward masking to block perception of our visual
   CSs and measured the effect of this training on subsequent unmasked
   performance. In two separate experiments we show a dissociation between
   CR expression and UCS expectancy following differential delay
   conditioning with masked CSs. In Experiment 1, we show that masked
   training facilitates CR expression when the same CSs are presented
   during a subsequent unmasked reacquisition task. In Experiment II we
   show that masked training retards learning when the CS+ is presented as
   part of a compound CS during a subsequent unmasked blocking task. Our
   results suggest that multiple memory systems operate in a parallel,
   independent manner to encode emotional memories.}},

Abstract = {{Habituation is a simple form of memory, yet its neurobiological
   mechanisms are only beginning to be understood in mammals. In the
   olfactory system, the neural correlates of habituation at a fast
   experimental timescale involving very short intertrial intervals (tens
   of seconds) have been shown to depend on synaptic adaptation in
   olfactory cortex. In contrast, behavioral habituation to odorants on a
   longer timescale with intertrial intervals of several minutes depends on
   processes in the olfactory bulb, as demonstrated by pharmacological
   studies. We here show that behavioral habituation to odorants on this
   longer timescale has a neuronal activity correlate in the olfactory
   bulb. Spiking responses of mitral cells in the rat olfactory bulb adapt
   to, and recover from, repeated odorant stimulation with 5-min intertrial
   intervals with a time course similar to that of behavioral habituation.
   Moreover, both the behavioral and neuronal effects of odor habituation
   require functioning N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors in the olfactory
   bulb.}},

Title = {{Operant Learning Requires NMDA-Receptor Activation in the Anterior
   Cingulate Cortex and Dorsomedial Striatum, but Not in the Orbitofrontal
   Cortex}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has shown that corticostriatal N-methyl-D-aspartate
   receptor (NMDAR) activation is necessary for operant learning. NMDAR
   activation induces plasticity-related intracellular signaling processes
   leading to gene expression, which are hypothesized to be important steps
   in codifying the content of learning. Operant learning induces immediate
   early gene (IEG) expression in key corticostriatal structures, namely
   the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), the orbitofrontal (OFC), and anterior
   cingulate cortices (ACC). Both the ACC and OFC send glutamatergic
   projections to the DMS, which is a crucial site for operant behavior.
   However, the role of NMDAR activation in these corticostriatal regions
   in operant learning is unknown. To test this hypothesis, the NMDA
   antagonist AP-5 (1 mu g/0.5 mu l) or saline was bilaterally
   microinjected into the ACC, OFC, and DMS of food-deprived rats just
   prior to operant learning sessions. NMDAR antagonism in the ACC and DMS
   impaired the acquisition of lever pressing for sucrose pellets but had
   no effect on lever pressing once learned. NMDAR blockade in OFC did not
   significantly impair operant learning, suggesting that NMDAR activation
   in operant learning is site-specific. These data extend our
   understanding of the role of NMDA receptors in operant learning and
   behavior throughout an extended corticostriatal network.}},

Abstract = {{In Pavlovian overshadowing, a stimulus that predicts a biologically
   important event reduces conditioning to another, equally predictive
   stimulus. We tested the effects of an opioid antagonist and dopamine
   agonist on the ability of a salient white noise to overshadow a less
   salient light. Rats were conditioned to fear a light or a noise light
   compound using a mild footshock. Compound-conditioned rats trained under
   the saline vehicle revealed significant overshadowing of the light by
   the noise. This overshadowing effect was significantly attenuated in
   rats trained under the opioid antagonist naltrexone, consistent with an
   opioid-mediated negative feedback model of conditioning. In line with
   predictions made by negative feedback-type models, we failed to obtain
   overshadowing with few trials, suggesting that the processes underlying
   conditioning during initial trials do not contribute to the
   opioid-dependent Pavlovian overshadowing obtained in our preparation.
   Lastly, we compared the involvement of dopamine-mediated and
   opioid-mediated processes in overshadowing by conditioning rats under
   the partial dopamine D, receptor agonist SKF 38393 or the opioid
   antagonist naltrexone. Both naltrexone and SKF 38393 were found to
   attenuate overshadowing; however, the behavioral profiles produced by
   each pharmacological manipulation were distinct. Collectively, these
   studies demonstrate an important role for both opioid- and
   dopamine-mediated processes in multiple-trial overshadowing.}},

Abstract = {{Administration of a single daily dose of nicotine has been shown to
   entrain circadian activity episodes both preceding and following the
   administration time that persist for several days after drug
   administration ceases. The present study tested the effects of multiple
   daily nicotine administrations on circadian activity episodes in adult
   female rats kept under constant light and rate-limited food access.
   Eight rats received 7 separate 7-day nicotine injection series, each
   followed by a 3-day test phase without injections. Subcutaneous nicotine
   was administered once a day during the 1st and 7th series, twice daily
   during the 2nd and 6th series, three times daily during the 3rd and 5th
   series, and four times daily during the 4th series. To control the
   cumulative daily dose throughout the study, 1.0 mg/kg nicotine was
   evenly divided among the injections within a single day. Pre- and
   post-administration effects of nicotine declined across the day, and
   significant entrainment of both pre- and post-nicotine episodes occurred
   for only one daily injection in each series. Additionally, post-nicotine
   episodes showed a different dose-response curve than the pre-nicotine
   episodes: post-nicotine wheel turns increased as the dose decreased,
   whereas pre-nicotine wheel turns remained relatively constant as the
   dose changed. These results provide evidence that nicotine-induced
   circadian entrainment to a single administration time does occur when
   the drug is administered multiple times a day, and pre- and
   post-nicotine circadian episodes are mediated at least partially by
   separate mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial navigation in the real-world is a complex task that involves
   many functions, such as landmark identification, orientation, and the
   calculation of heading vectors. This study uses a 2 x 2 experimental
   design with fMRI to isolate mnemonic and navigational processes that
   accompany the calculation of heading vectors. The conditions are based
   on a working memory version of the Morris water maze task and navigation
   takes place in a visually austere virtual environment. In an allocentric
   condition, subjects navigate around a circular arena where there is one
   small red square on the wall. Each trial begins with an encoding phase
   in which subjects locate and navigate to a visible coin. Then, in a test
   phase, after being randomly repositioned, they retrieve the coin when it
   is invisible. In a control task, there are eight distinct cues around
   the arena that provide direct cue-place information. Results show
   significant interaction effects in bilateral posterior parietal cortex,
   which is compatible with evidence that parietal cortex helps translating
   between allocentric coordinates and egocentric directions. There was
   also greater activation for the allocentric task in right posterior
   hippocampus and left retrosplenial cortex, which could be related to
   self-localization and orientation. The findings are also compatible with
   the recent proposal by Kubie and Fenton (2009) that navigation primarily
   depends on heading vectors between salient places.}},

Abstract = {{Excitotoxicity plays a major role in various neurological disorders. In
   this study, we explored the behavioral and neurotoxic effects of
   intraventricular NMDA administration in mice. After NMDA injection,
   acute seizures were followed by impairments in locomotor activity, motor
   performance on a rotarod, and climbing ability. Mice killed 1 day after
   NMDA administration showed increased synaptosomal reactive oxygen
   species ROS production and calcium concentration and decreased
   mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial reductase activities,
   and neuronal membrane Na(+), K(+)-ATPase and mg(2+)-ATPase activities.
   One and 3 days after excitotoxic injury, Golgi stains showed that
   dendritic length and spine density were significantly decreased in
   neurons of the hippocampal dentate gyms. Some mice received honokiol,
   tea polyphenol plus memantine, and honokiol plus memantine prior to NMDA
   treatment; the occurrence of generalized seizures was attenuated,
   seizure scores were reduced, latency to generalized seizures was
   prolonged, and motor impairments were lessened. Moreover, all of the
   neurochemical changes of the synaptosomes were also ameliorated. In
   conclusion, the behavioral and neurotoxic effects of
   intracerebroventricular injection of NMDA were ameliorated by treatment
   with honokiol alone or combined treatment with either tea polyphenol
   plus memantine or honokiol plus memantine, but only partly by either tea
   polyphenol or memantine alone. The therapeutic potential of these
   neuroprotective regimens in treating excitotoxicity-related diseases
   merits for further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{The medial preoptic area (MPOA) is critical for male sexual behavior.
   Glutamate is released in the MPOA of male rats during copulation, and
   increasing glutamate levels by reverse dialysis of glutamate uptake
   inhibitors facilitates mating. Conversely, increased release of
   serotonin (5-HT) inhibits sexual behavior. In both rats and men,
   selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) impair erection,
   ejaculation, and libido. Here we reverse-dialyzed 5-HT through
   concentric microdialysis probes in the MPOA of male rats; concurrently
   we collected 2-min samples for analysis of glutamate and measured sexual
   behavior. Sexual activity, and especially ejaculation, increased levels
   of glutamate in the MPOA. However, reverse dialysis of 5-HT into the
   MPOA impaired ejaculatory ability and attenuated glutamate release.
   Implications of these results for impairment of sexual behavior that
   results from administration of SSRIs are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The medial prefrontal cortex of rats has a role in many aspects of
   cognitive function. including forms of inhibitory learning. Recent
   studies suggest that there is heterogeneity in the contributions of the
   prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) regions of the medial prefrontal
   cortex to response inhibition. The present study tested the effects of
   separate neurotoxic lesions of the PL or IL on a serial feature negative
   discrimination task (negative occasion setting). Rats received training
   sessions consisting of 16 trials: on 4 trials in each session, a tone
   was presented and followed by food reward; on the other 12 trials the
   tone was preceded by a visual stimulus and not reinforced. The results
   indicate that PL but not IL is necessary for learning the
   discrimination. We then tested the effects of these lesions on rats that
   were first extensively trained in the task. Rats that had been trained
   for 30 days before receiving PL or IL lesions were still able to perform
   the task as well as controls after surgery. Thus, PL lesions disrupt
   acquisition but not performance of a serial feature negative
   discrimination.}},

Abstract = {{Fatigue, an overwhelming lack of physical or mental energy, is a common
   complaint in patients affected by multiple sclerosis (MS). Although
   different mechanisms have been proposed to explain MS-related fatigue,
   injury of distinct anatomical networks seems to be relevant in fatigue
   etiology. Particularly, theories point to fronto-striatal network
   pathological changes as a possible neural basis of fatigue. To
   investigate the role of fronto-striatal white matter structural
   alterations in fatigue perception we prospectively recruited 40
   relapsing remitting patients with MS and 15 healthy controls. In
   patients with MS, fatigue was assessed using a validated measure, the
   Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS; Kos et al., 2005). Brain MRI scans
   were acquired for each subject enrolled with diffusion tensor imaging.
   Diffusion tensor data were correlated with MFIS scores using voxel-wise
   analysis of fractional anisotropy maps and fiber tractography
   algorithms. A significant cluster of voxels correlating with fatigue
   scores located in the deep left frontal white matter was identified.
   Fiber tractography revealed the cluster to be included in a complex
   fronto-frontal, fronto-striatal, fronto-occipital, and fronto-limbic
   network. Structural properties of the traced white matter fiber bundles
   correlated with fatigue perception and patients with clinically relevant
   fatigue were found to present reduced white matter integrity in the
   aforementioned tracts compared to those with lower levels of fatigue.
   Our observations show a significant involvement of different frontal
   networks in the pathophysiology of fatigue, thus accounting for the
   multifaceted nature of this disabling symptom.}},

Abstract = {{Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) is a potent neurotrophic factor that
   is involved in brain development and the formation of long-term memory.
   It has recently been shown that acute FGF2, administered at the time of
   learning, enhances long-term memory for contextual fear conditioning as
   well as extinction of conditioned fear in developing rats. As other
   research has shown that administering FGF2 on the first day of life
   leads to long-term morphological changes in the hippocampus, in the
   present study we investigated whether early life exposure to FGF2
   affects contextual fear conditioning, and renewal following extinction,
   later in life. Experiment I demonstrated that a single injection of FGF2
   on Postnatal Day (PND) 1 did not lead to any detectable changes in
   contextual fear conditioning in PND 16 or PND 23 rats. Experiments 2 and
   3 demonstrated that 5 days of injections of FGF2 (from PND 1-5)
   facilitated contextual fear conditioning in PND 16 and PND 23 rats.
   Experiment 4 demonstrated that the observed facilitation of memory was
   not due to FGF2 increasing rats' sensitivity to foot shock. Experiment 5
   showed that early life exposure to FGF2 did not affect learning about a
   discrete conditioned stimulus, but did allow PND 16 rats to use
   contextual information in more complex ways, leading to
   context-dependent extinction of conditioned fear. These results further
   implicate FGF2 as a critical signal involved in the development of
   learning and memory.}},

Abstract = {{In addition to mental retardation, individuals with Down syndrome (DS)
   also develop the neuropathological changes typical of Alzheimer's
   disease (AD) and the majority of these individuals exhibit dementia. The
   Ts65Dn mouse model of DS exhibits key features of these disorders,
   including early degeneration of cholinergic basal forebrain (CBF)
   neurons and impairments in functions dependent on the two CBF projection
   systems; namely, attention and explicit memory. Herein, we demonstrate
   that supplementing the maternal diet with excess choline during
   pregnancy and lactation dramatically improved attentional function of
   the adult trisomic offspring. Specifically, the adult offspring of
   choline-supplemented Ts65Dn dams performed significantly better than
   unsupplemented Ts65Dn mice on a series of 5 visual attention tasks, and
   in fact, on some tasks did not differ from the normosomic (2N) controls.
   A second area of dysfunction in the trisomic animals, heightened
   reactivity to committing an error, was partially normalized by the early
   choline supplementation. The 2N littermates also benefited from
   increased maternal choline intake on 1 attention task. These findings
   collectively suggest that perinatal choline supplementation might
   significantly lessen cognitive dysfunction in DS and reduce cognitive
   decline in related neurodegenerative disorders such as AD.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research shows that prenatal binge ethanol exposure during
   gestation days (GD) 17 to 20 of the rat, increases postnatal ethanol
   intake and enhances ethanol's palatability, both effects being mediated
   by the opioid system. The amniotic fluid of the last period of gestation
   (GD 20) of the rat has been found to activate the opioid system and to
   induce conditioned preference in fetal and neonatal rats. We aimed to
   investigate whether enhanced acceptance for ethanol is observed when rat
   fetuses are exposed to it either on GD 17-18 or on GD 19-20. The results
   show that 14-day old pups whose mothers received ethanol on GD 19-20
   consumed more ethanol and found ethanol more palatable when compared to
   pups exposed to ethanol on GD 17-18, or to pups experiencing ethanol and
   naloxone on GD 19-20. The augmented ethanol intake was observed as well
   after weaning (PD 26-27). These data indicate that exposure to ethanol
   on GD 19-20, but not before, triggers appetitive learning related to
   ethanol's flavor. This prenatally acquired memory is retained for at
   least 4 weeks and can be detected postnatally as enhanced palatability
   of ethanol's flavor as well as increased intake of ethanol. This
   increased liking of ethanol is mediated by the opioid system, although
   it cannot be clearly determined whether the prenatal activation of the
   opioid system is induced by the action of ethanol or by the activity of
   amniotic fluid components at that gestational age.}},

   response across cues and days. Depending on silent gap length, both
   reduction (inhibition) and enhancement (facilitation) of startle were
   observed. Finally, only the young adult animals showed an
   experience-related shift from facilitation to attenuation in response to
   very short silent gap cues, and this initial early facilitation

Abstract = {{Reversal and extinction learning represent forms of cognitive
   flexibility that refer to the ability of an animal to alter behavior in
   response to unanticipated changes on environmental demands. A role for
   dopamine and glutamate in modulating this behavior has been implicated.
   Here, we determined the effects of intracerebroventricular injections in
   pigeons' forebrain of the D2-like receptor agonist quinpirole, the
   D2-like receptor antagonist sulpiride and the N-methyl-D-aspartate
   receptor antagonist AP-5 on initial acquisition and reversal of a color
   discrimination task. On day one, pigeons had to learn to discriminate
   two color keys. On day two, pigeons first performed a retention test,
   which was followed by a reversal of the reward contingencies of the two
   color keys. None of the drugs altered performance in the initial
   acquisition of color discrimination or affected the retention of the
   learned color key. In contrast, all drugs impaired reversal learning by
   increasing trials and incorrect responses in the reversal session. Our
   data support the hypothesis that D2-like receptor mechanisms, like
   N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor modulations, are involved in cognitive
   flexibility and relearning processes, but not in initial learning of
   stimulus-reward association.}},

Title = {{Strain Difference in the Effect of Infra limbic Cortex Lesions on Fear

Abstract = {{The infralimbic division of the medial prefrontal cortex (IL) has been
   implicated in the consolidation and retention of extinction memories.
   However, the effects of IL lesions on the retention of extinction memory
   are inconsistent. In the present experiments, we examined whether rat
   strain influences the effects of IL lesions on extinction. In Experiment
   1, Sprague-Dawley (SD) or Long-Evans (LE) rats received a standard
   auditory fear conditioning procedure, which was followed by an
   extinction session; freezing served as the index of conditional fear.
   Our results reveal that focal IL lesions impair the retention of
   extinction in SD, but not LE rats. In addition to the strain difference
   in sensitivity to IL lesions, LE rats exhibited significantly higher
   levels of contextual fear before the outset of extinction training than
   SD rats. In a second experiment we thus examined whether contextual fear
   influenced the sensitivity of extinction to IL lesions in LE rats. LE
   rats received the same conditioning as in Experiment I. and then were
   either merely exposed to a novel context or administered unsignaled
   shocks in that context, followed by extinction and test sessions. Our
   results reveal that LE rats with IL lesions showed normal extinction
   regardless of the levels of contextual fear manifest before extinction.
   Thus, we conclude that rat strain is an important variable that
   influences the role of infralimbic cortex in fear extinction.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{124}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{398-404}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Recent evidence suggests that liking and wanting of food rewards can be
   experimentally dissociated (e.g., Berridge, 1996); this dissociation
   extends to attenuated neophobia in the present study. Rats tend to eat
   less of a novel food than a familiar food, a phenomenon called
   neophobia. The present experiments evaluated whether attenuation of
   neophobia by prior exposure reflects enhanced liking of the flavor using
   the Taste Reactivity (TR) test. In Experiment 1, rats given five 10-s TR
   trials with water or various concentrations of saccharin solution
   (0.1\%, 0.2\%, 0.5\%) did not show a change in the number of hedonic
   reactions displayed across trials. However, in a subsequent consumption
   test from a bottle containing 0.25\% saccharin solution, rats with no
   prior saccharin exposure (group water) consumed less than rats with
   prior saccharin exposure; that is they displayed neophobia. In
   Experiment 2, whether rats received five 10-s TR trials with water or
   0.5\% saccharin solution, they did not display a difference in hedonic
   reactions to 0.25\% saccharin solution in two 5-min TR test trials.
   These results suggest that the attenuation of neophobia is evidenced as
   an increase in the tendency to approach a bottle containing the flavored
   solution (wanting), but not as an enhanced liking of that solution.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive research with laboratory animals indicates that the
   hippocampus is crucial for the formation and use of spatial memory.
   Hippocampal lesions in rodents impair spatial memory on radial arm maze
   tasks. It is unknown whether amnesic patients with hippocampal damage
   would exhibit similar impairments on a virtual version of a radial arm
   maze. To evaluate the importance of the hippocampus in spatial learning
   and memory, we tested amnesic participants with hippocampal damage in a
   virtual radial arm maze environment. The virtual radial arm maze
   required participants to learn and remember 4 rewarded arms of 8 total
   arms. Spatial learning and memory were assessed using the participants'
   ability to use salient distal cues in the virtual room to remember the 4
   rewarded arms. Amnesic participants' latencies were longer and distance
   traveled was greater to the rewarded arms compared with nonamnesic
   participants. Amnesic participants made more errors than nonamnesic
   participants by either entering nonrewarded arms or by revisiting
   previously entered arms. These data are analogous to previous animal
   research. Overall, the human hippocampus is necessary for spatial memory
   and navigation in a virtual radial arm maze task.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of age on cerebral
   correlates of olfactory induced negative emotions. We investigated 15
   healthy women (aged 21-47) in a functional MRI (fMRI) study during
   passive smelling of one negative odor (rotten yeast) and two control
   conditions presenting a neutral odor (vanilla) and odorless ambient air.
   Besides odor-specific differences in ratings of valence (yeast less
   pleasant than vanilla and air), intensity (yeast more intense than
   vanilla and air), and arousal (yeast more arousing than vanilla and
   air), self-ratings verified the intended mood induction effect: subjects
   experienced more disgust during yeast stimulation compared to ambient
   air and vanilla. Along with the superior temporal cortex, medial, and
   lateral orbitofrontal activations were found to discriminate between
   negative and neutral olfactory stimulation (yeast and vanilla) directly.
   Activations of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the caudate were
   correlated with age and showed stronger valence-related responses (yeast
   vs. vanilla) in younger compared to older women. Stronger BOLD signals
   within the anterior cingulate gyrus, insula and motor areas were found
   during negative compared to neutral stimulation and are considered to
   represent an attempt to down-regulate the strong emotional experience
   and the organisms' preparation for withdrawal, respectively. Our results
   stress the role of orbitofrontal and superior temporal brain regions in
   odor-related valence coding and stress the necessity to consider age as
   a modulating factor for further studies, even in relatively young
   samples.}},

Abstract = {{There is growing interest in examining oxytocin and social functioning
   in human and non-human primates. Studies of human oxytocin biology are
   typically restricted to peripheral assessments because opportunities to
   collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are rare. Several studies have
   examined CSF oxytocin levels in captive adult primates, but none to our
   knowledge have been conducted under free-ranging conditions and
   inclusive of infants. The main goal of this study was to establish
   feasibility of quantifying CSF oxytocin levels in free-ranging adult
   female and infant rhesus monkeys living on Cayo Santiago, PR. CSF
   oxytocin levels were examined in relation to individuals' demographic
   and reproductive characteristics as well as plasma cortisol levels. CSF
   oxytocin concentrations ranged from 36.02 to 134.41 pg/ml in adult
   females (ages 7-26 years; N = 31) and 35.94 to 77.3 pg/ml in infants
   (ages 38-134 days; N = 17). CSF oxytocin levels were positively
   correlated with adult female age and negatively correlated with infant
   age. The former correlation was driven by reproductive status. CSF
   oxytocin levels were unrelated to dominance rank or plasma cortisol
   levels. In contrast to a previous study of plasma oxytocin
   concentrations in this population, CSF oxytocin levels did not differ
   significantly between lactating and non-lactating females. These
   findings: 1) provide feasibility data for examining CSF oxytocin levels
   in free-ranging non-human primates and 2) indicate that CSF oxytocin
   levels may be a biomarker of age-related central nervous system changes
   across lifespan development. Research is now required to examine CSF
   oxytocin levels in the context of social functioning in free-ranging
   rhesus monkeys.}},

Abstract = {{Cultural neuroscience is an interdisciplinary field of research that
   investigates interrelations among culture, mind and the brain. Drawing
   on both the growing body of scientific evidence on cultural variation in
   psychological processes and the recent development of social and
   cognitive neuroscience, this emerging field of research aspires to
   understand how culture as an amalgam of values, meanings, conventions,
   and artifacts that constitute daily social realities might interact with
   the mind and its underlying brain pathways of each individual member of
   the culture. In this article, following a brief review of studies that
   demonstrate the surprising degree to which brain processes are malleably
   shaped by cultural tools and practices, the authors discuss cultural
   variation in brain processes involved in self-representations,
   cognition, emotion and motivation. They then propose (i) that primary
   values of culture such as independence and interdependence are reflected
   in the compositions of cultural tasks (i.e. daily routines designed to
   accomplish the cultural values) and further (ii) that active and
   sustained engagement in these tasks yields culturally patterned neural
   activities of the brain, thereby laying the ground for the embodied
   construction of the self and identity. Implications for research on
   culture and the brain are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropologists have become increasingly interested in embodiment-that
   is, the ways that socio-cultural factors influence the form, behavior
   and subjective experience of human bodies. At the same time, social
   cognitive neuroscience has begun to reveal the mechanisms of embodiment
   by investigating the neural underpinnings and consequences of social
   experience. Despite this overlap, the two fields have barely engaged one
   another. We suggest three interconnected domains of inquiry in which the
   intersection of neuroscience and anthropology can productively inform
   our understanding of the relationship between human brains and their
   socio-cultural contexts. These are: the social construction of emotion,
   cultural psychiatry, and the embodiment of ritual. We build on both
   current research findings in cultural neuroscience and ethnographic data
   on cultural differences in thought and behavior, to generate novel,
   ecologically informed hypotheses for future study. In addition, we lay
   out a specific suggestion for operationalizing insights from
   anthropology in the context of cultural neuroscience research.
   Specifically, we advocate the development of field studies that use
   portable measurement technologies to connect individual patterns of
   biological response with socio-cultural processes. We illustrate the
   potential of such an approach with data from a study of psychophysiology
   and religious devotion in Northeastern Brazil.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we argue that a combined anthropology/neuroscience
   field of enquiry can make a significant and distinctive contribution to
   the study of the relationship between culture and the brain. This field,
   which can appropriately be termed as neuroanthropology, is conceived of
   as being complementary to and mutually informative with social and
   cultural neuroscience. We start by providing an introduction to the
   culture concept in anthropology. We then present a detailed
   characterization of neuroanthropology and its methods and how they
   relate to the anthropological understanding of culture. The field is
   described as a humanistic science, that is, a field of enquiry founded
   on the perceived epistemological and methodological interdependence of
   science and the humanities. We also provide examples that illustrate the
   proposed methodological model for neuroanthropology. We conclude with a
   discussion about specific contributions the field can make to the study

Abstract = {{The investigation of cultural phenomena using neuroscientific
   methods-cultural neuroscience (CN)-is receiving increasing attention.
   Yet it is unclear whether the integration of cultural study and
   neuroscience is merely additive, providing additional evidence of neural
   plasticity in the human brain, or truly synergistic, yielding
   discoveries that neither discipline could have achieved alone. We
   discuss how the parent fields to CN: cross-cultural psychology,
   psychological anthropology and cognitive neuroscience inform the
   investigation of the role of cultural experience in shaping the brain.
   Drawing on well-established methodologies from cross-cultural psychology
   and cognitive neuroscience, we outline a set of guidelines for CN,
   evaluate 17 CN studies in terms of these guidelines, and provide a
   summary table of our results. We conclude that the combination of
   culture and neuroscience is both additive and synergistic; while some CN
   methodologies and findings will represent the direct union of
   information from parent fields, CN studies employing the methodological
   rigor required by this logistically challenging new field have the
   potential to transform existing methodologies and produce unique
   findings.}},

Abstract = {{Cultural neuroscience is set to flourish in the next few years. As the
   field develops, it is necessary to reflect on what is meant by `culture'
   and how this can be translated for the laboratory context. This article
   uses the example of the adolescent brain to discuss three aspects of
   culture that may help us to shape and reframe questions, interpretations
   and applications in cultural neuroscience: cultural contingencies of
   categories, cultural differences in experience and cultural context of
   neuroscience research. The last few years have seen a sudden increase in
   the study of adolescence as a period of both structural and functional
   plasticity, with new brain-based explanations of teenage behaviour being
   taken up in education, policy and medicine. However, the concept of
   adolescence, as an object of behavioural science, took shape relatively
   recently, not much more than a hundred years ago and was shaped by a
   number of cultural and historical factors. Moreover, research in
   anthropology and cross-cultural psychology has shown that the experience
   of adolescence, as a period of the lifespan, is variable and contingent
   upon culture. The emerging field of cultural neuroscience has begun to
   tackle the question of cultural differences in social cognitive
   processing in adults. In this article, I explore what a cultural
   neuroscience can mean in the case of adolescence. I consider how to
   integrate perspectives from social neuroscience and anthropology to
   conceptualize, and to empirically study, adolescence as a culturally
   variable phenomenon, which, itself, has been culturally constructed.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main goals of cognitive science is to discover the underlying
   principles that characterize human cognition, but this enterprise is
   complicated by culturally-driven variability. While much fruitful work
   has focused on how culture influences the contents of cognition, here I
   argue that culture can in addition exercise a profound effect on the how
   of cognition-the mechanisms by which cognitive tasks get done. I argue
   that much of the fundamental processes of daily cognitive activity
   involve the operation of cognitive tools that are not genetically
   determined but instead are invented and culturally transmitted. Further,
   these cognitive inventions become `firmware', consituting a
   re-engineering of the individual's cognitive architecture. That is,
   ontogenetic experience from one's cultural context serves to re-tool the
   developing mind into a variety of disparate cognitive phenotypes.
   Drawing on several mutually isolated literatures, I advance four claims
   to the effect that cognitive tools (i) are ubitquitous in everyday
   cognition, (ii) result in reorganization of the neural system, (iii) are
   founded in embodied representations and (iv) were made possible by the
   evolution of an unprecedented degree of voluntary control over the body.
   I conclude by discussing the implications for the agenda of cognitive
   science.}},

Abstract = {{The 7 repeat (7R) allele of the dopamine receptor D4 gene has been
   associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and risk
   taking. On the cross-population scale, 7R allele frequencies have been
   shown to be higher in populations with more of a history of long-term
   migrations. It has also been shown that the 7R allele is associated with
   individuals having multiple ancestries. Here, we conduct a replication
   of this latter finding with two independent samples. Measures of
   subjects' ancestry are used to examine past reproductive bonds. The
   individuals' history of interracial/ancestral dating and their feelings
   about this are also assessed. Tentative support for an association
   between multiple ancestries and the 7R allele was found. These results
   are dependent upon the method of questioning subjects about their
   ancestries, with only finer-scale measures of ancestry being associated
   with 7R. Interracial dating and feelings about interracial pairing were
   not related to the presence of the 7R allele. This study provides
   continued support for a role for the 7R allele in migration and/or mate
   choice patterns. However, replications and extensions of this study are
   needed and the way ancestry/race is assessed must be carefully
   considered.}},

Abstract = {{Genes and culture are often thought of as opposite ends of the
   nature-nurture spectrum, but here we examine possible interactions.
   Genetic association studies suggest that variation within the genes of
   central neurotransmitter systems, particularly the serotonin (5-HTTLPR,
   MAOA-uVNTR) and opioid (OPRM1 A118G), are associated with individual
   differences in social sensitivity, which reflects the degree of
   emotional responsivity to social events and experiences. Here, we review
   recent work that has demonstrated a robust cross-national correlation
   between the relative frequency of variants in these genes and the
   relative degree of individualism-collectivism in each population,
   suggesting that collectivism may have developed and persisted in
   populations with a high proportion of putative social sensitivity
   alleles because it was more compatible with such groups. Consistent with
   this notion, there was a correlation between the relative proportion of
   these alleles and lifetime prevalence of major depression across
   nations. The relationship between allele frequency and depression was
   partially mediated by individualism- collectivism, suggesting that
   reduced levels of depression in populations with a high proportion of
   social sensitivity alleles is due to greater collectivism. These results
   indicate that genetic variation may interact with ecological and social
   factors to influence psychocultural differences.}},

Abstract = {{The present research examined the interaction between genes and culture
   as potential determinants of individuals' locus of attention. As the
   serotonin (5-HT) system has been associated with attentional focus and
   the ability to adapt to changes in reinforcement, we examined the
   serotonin 1A receptor polymorphism (5-HTR1A). Koreans and European
   Americans were genotyped and reported their chronic locus of attention.
   There was a significant interaction between 5-HTR1A genotype and culture
   in the locus of attention. Koreans reported attending to the field more
   than European Americans, and this cultural difference was moderated by
   5-HTR1A. There was a linear pattern such that those homozygous for the G
   allele, which is associated with reduced ability to adapt to changes in
   reinforcement, more strongly endorsed the culturally reinforced mode of
   thinking than those homozygous for the C allele, with those heterozygous
   in the middle. Our findings suggest that the same genetic predisposition
   can result in divergent psychological outcomes, depending on an
   individual's cultural context.}},

Abstract = {{This study focused on a possible temperament-by-culture interaction.
   Specifically, it explored whether a basic temperament/ personality trait
   (sensory processing sensitivity; SPS), perhaps having a genetic
   component, might moderate a previously established cultural difference
   in neural responses when making context-dependent vs context-independent
   judgments of simple visual stimuli. SPS has been hypothesized to
   underlie what has been called inhibitedness or reactivity in infants,
   introversion in adults, and reactivity or responsivness in diverse
   animal species. Some biologists view the trait as one of two innate
   strategies-observing carefully before acting vs being first to act. Thus
   the central characteristic of SPS is hypothesized to be a deep
   processing of information. Here, 10 European-Americans and 10 East
   Asians underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing
   simple visuospatial tasks emphasizing judgments that were either context
   independent (typically easier for Americans) or context dependent
   (typically easier for Asians). As reported elsewhere, each group
   exhibited greater activation for the culturally non-preferred task in
   frontal and parietal regions associated with greater effort in attention
   and working memory. However, further analyses, reported here for the
   first time, provided preliminary support for moderation by SPS.
   Consistent with the careful-processing theory, high-SPS individuals
   showed little cultural difference; low-SPS, strong culture differences.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral and eye-tracking studies on cultural differences have found
   that while Westerners have a bias for analytic processing and attend
   more to face features, East Asians are more holistic and attend more to
   contextual scenes. In this neuroimaging study, we hypothesized that
   these culturally different visual processing styles would be associated
   with cultural differences in the selective activity of the fusiform
   regions for faces, and the parahippocampal and lingual regions for
   contextual stimuli. East Asians and Westerners passively viewed face and
   house stimuli during an functional magnetic resonance imaging
   experiment. As expected, we observed more selectivity for faces in
   Westerners in the left fusiform face area (FFA) reflecting a more
   analytic processing style. Additionally, Westerners showed bilateral
   activity to faces in the FFA whereas East Asians showed more right
   lateralization. In contrast, no cultural differences were detected in
   the parahippocampal place area (PPA), although there was a trend for
   East Asians to show greater house selectivity than Westerners in the
   lingual landmark area, consistent with more holistic processing in East
   Asians. These findings demonstrate group biases in Westerners and East
   Asians that operate on perceptual processing in the brain and are
   consistent with previous eye-tracking data that show cultural biases to
   faces.}},

Abstract = {{Converging behavioral and neuroimaging evidence indicates that culture
   influences the processing of complex visual scenes. Whereas Westerners
   focus on central objects and tend to ignore context, East Asians process
   scenes more holistically, attending to the context in which objects are
   embedded. We investigated cultural differences in contextual processing
   by manipulating the congruence of visual scenes presented in an
   fMR-adaptation paradigm. We hypothesized that East Asians would show
   greater adaptation to incongruent scenes, consistent with their tendency
   to process contextual relationships more extensively than Westerners.
   Sixteen Americans and 16 native Chinese were scanned while viewing sets
   of pictures consisting of a focal object superimposed upon a background
   scene. In half of the pictures objects were paired with congruent
   backgrounds, and in the other half objects were paired with incongruent
   backgrounds. We found that within both the right and left lateral
   occipital complexes, Chinese participants showed significantly greater
   adaptation to incongruent scenes than to congruent scenes relative to
   American participants. These results suggest that Chinese were more
   sensitive to contextual incongruity than were Americans and that they
   reacted to incongruent object/background pairings by focusing greater
   attention on the object.}},

Abstract = {{East Asians have been found to allocate relatively greater attention to
   background objects, whereas European Americans have been found to
   allocate relatively greater attention to foreground objects. This is
   well documented across a variety of cognitive measures. We used a
   modification of the Ganis and Kutas (2003) N400 event-related potential
   design to measure the degree to which Asian Americans and European
   Americans responded to semantic incongruity between target objects and
   background scenes. As predicted, Asian Americans showed a greater
   negativity to incongruent trials than to congruent trials. In contrast,
   European Americans showed no difference in amplitude across the two
   conditions. Furthermore, smaller magnitude N400 incongruity effects were
   associated with higher independent self-construal scores. These data
   suggest that Asian Americans are processing the relationship between
   foreground and background objects to a greater degree than European
   Americans, which is consistent with hypothesized greater holistic
   processing among East Asians. Implications for using neural measures,
   the role of semantic processing to understand cultural differences in

   domain-specific (e. g. semantic knowledge) processes to differences in
   semantic judgments across cultures. Previous behavioral experiments have
   identified cross-cultural differences in categorization, with East
   Asians preferring strategies involving thematic or functional
   relationships (e. g. cow-grass) and Americans preferring categorical
   relationships (e. g. cow-chicken). East Asians and American participants
   underwent functional imaging while alternating between categorical or
   thematic strategies to sort triads of words, as well as matching words
   on control trials. Many similarities were observed. However, across both
   category and relationship trials compared to match (control) trials,
   East Asians activated a frontal-parietal network implicated in
   controlled executive processes, whereas Americans engaged regions of the
   temporal lobes and the cingulate, possibly in response to conflict in
   the semantic content of information. The results suggest that cultures
   differ in the strategies employed to resolve conflict between competing

Abstract = {{Cultural neuroscience provides a new approach for understanding the
   impact of culture on the human brain (and vice versa) opening thus new
   avenues for cross-disciplinary collaboration with archaeology and
   anthropology. Finding new meaningful and productive unit of analysis is
   essential for such collaboration. But what can archaeological
   preoccupation with material culture and long-term change contribute to
   this end? In this article, I introduce and discuss the notion of the
   brain-artefact interface (BAI) as a useful conceptual bridge between
   neuroplastisty and the extended mind. I argue that a key challenge for
   archaeology and cultural neuroscience lies in the cross-disciplinary
   understanding of the processes by which our plastic enculturated brains
   become constituted within the wider extended networks of non-biological
   artefacts and cultural practices that delineate the real spatial and
   temporal boundaries of the human cognitive map.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, complex cultural symbols like brands are investigated
   with psychological approaches. Often this is done by using semantic
   differentials, in which participants are asked to rate a brand regarding
   different pairs of adjectives. Only recently, functional magnetic
   resonance imaging ( fMRI) has been used to examine brands. In the
   current work we used fMRI in combination with a semantic differential to
   cross-validate both methods and to improve the characterization of the
   basic factors constituting the semantic space. To this end we presented
   pictures of brands while recording subject's brain activity during an
   fMRI experiment. Results of the semantic differential arranged the
   brands in a semantic space illustrating their relationships to other
   cultural symbols. FMRI results revealed activation of the medial
   prefrontal cortex for brands that loaded high on the factor `social
   competence', suggesting an involvement of a cortical network associated
   with social cognitions. In contrast, brands closely related to the
   factor `potency' showed decreased activity in the superior frontal gyri,
   possibly related to working memory during task performance. We discuss
   the results as a different engagement of the prefrontal cortex when
   perceiving brands as cultural symbols.}},

Abstract = {{This study explored the role of culture in shaping music perception and
   memory. We tested the hypothesis that listeners demonstrate different
   patterns of activation associated with music processing-particularly
   right frontal cortex-when encoding and retrieving culturally familiar
   and unfamiliar stimuli, with the latter evoking broader activation
   consistent with more complex memory tasks. Subjects (n = 16) were
   right-handed adults born and raised in the USA (n = 8) or Turkey (n = 8)
   with minimal music training. Using fMRI procedures, we scanned subjects
   during two tasks: (i) listening to novel musical examples from their own
   culture and an unfamiliar culture and (ii) identifying which among a
   series of brief excerpts were taken from the longer examples. Both
   groups were more successful remembering music of their home culture. We
   found greater activation for culturally unfamiliar music listening in
   the left cerebellar region, right angular gyrus, posterior precuneus and
   right middle frontal area extending into the inferior frontal cortex.
   Subjects demonstrated greater activation in the cingulate gyrus and
   right lingual gyrus when engaged in recall of culturally unfamiliar
   music. This study provides evidence for the influence of culture on
   music perception and memory performance at both a behavioral and
   neurological level.}},

Abstract = {{A fundamental challenge facing social perceivers is identifying the
   cause underlying other people's behavior. Evidence indicates that East
   Asian perceivers are more likely than Western perceivers to reference
   the social context when attributing a cause to a target person's
   actions. One outstanding question is whether this reflects a culture's
   influence on automatic or on controlled components of causal
   attribution. After reviewing behavioral evidence that culture can shape
   automatic mental processes as well as controlled reasoning, we discuss
   the evidence in favor of cultural differences in automatic and
   controlled components of causal attribution more specifically. We
   contend that insights emerging from social cognitive neuroscience
   research can inform this debate. After introducing an attribution
   framework popular among social neuroscientists, we consider findings
   relevant to the automaticity of attribution, before speculating how one
   could use a social neuroscience approach to clarify whether culture
   affects automatic, controlled or both types of attribution processes.}},

Abstract = {{Social orientation (interdependence as opposed to independence) has been
   suggested as a major cultural dimension. In the present work, we used a
   specific stimulus-locked component of electroencephalogram and found,
   for the first time, that the perceiver's social orientation modulates
   the brain response to incongruity of word meaning to attendant vocal
   tone. Participants judged the verbal meaning of emotionally spoken
   emotional words while ignoring the vocal tone. As predicted, there was a
   greater negative event-related potential between 450 and 900 ms after
   the stimulus onset when the verbal content was incongruous with the
   background vocal tone, relative to when the two were congruous. Of
   importance, this incongruity-based late negativity was larger when
   participants were unobtrusively exposed to schematic human faces while
   listening to the stimulus words and for females than for males.
   Moreover, this late negativity was reliably predicted by chronic social
   orientation for females, but not for males and in the face condition,
   but not in the no-face control condition. Implications for future work
   on culture are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Representations of self are thought to be dynamically influenced by

   neuroimaging studies of self-representations have either ignored
   cultural influences or operationalized culture as country of origin. The
   present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the
   neural correlates of individual differences in interdependent
   self-construal. Participants rated whether trait adjectives applied to
   themselves or their mothers, or judged their valence or font. Findings
   indicated that individual differences in interdependent self-construal
   correlated positively with increased activation in the medial prefrontal
   cortex and posterior cingulated cortex when making judgments about
   one-self vs making judgments about one's mother. This suggests that
   those with greater interdependent self-construals may rely more upon
   episodic memory, reflected appraisals, or theory of mind to incorporate
   social information to make judgments about themselves.}},

   results in Han participants with the ventral medial prefrontal cortex
   and left anterior cingulate cortex showing stronger activation in
   self-processing when compared with other-processing conditions. However,
   no typical self-reference pattern was identified in Tibetan participants

   subjective sense of `I-ness' in Tibetan Buddhists. Our findings lend
   support to the presumed role of culture and religion in shaping the

Abstract = {{Our recent work showed that self-trait judgment is associated with
   increased activity in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) in
   non-religious Chinese, but in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex
   (DMPFC) in Chinese Christians. The current work further investigated
   neural substrates of self-referential processing in Chinese Buddhists.
   Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we scanned 14 Chinese
   Buddhists, while they conducted trait judgments of the self, Zhu Rongji
   (the former Chinese premier), Sakyamuni (the Buddhist leader) and Jesus
   (the Christian leader). We found that, relative to Zhu Rongji judgment,
   self-judgment in Buddhist participants failed to generate increased
   activation in the VMPFC but induced increased activations in the
   DMPFC/rostral anterior cingulate cortex, midcingulate and the left
   frontal/insular cortex. Self-judgment was also associated with decreased
   functional connectivity between the DMPFC and posterior parietal cortex
   compared with Zhu Rongji judgment. The results suggest that Buddhist
   doctrine of No-self results in weakened neural coding of stimulus
   self-relatedness in the VMPFC, but enhanced evaluative processes of
   self-referential stimuli in the DMPFC. Moreover, self-referential
   processing in Buddhists is characterized by monitoring the conflict
   between the doctrine of No-self and self-focus thinking during
   self-trait judgment.}},

Abstract = {{The direction of others' eye gaze has important influences on how we
   perceive their emotional expressions. Here, we examined differences in
   neural activation to direct-versus averted-gaze fear faces as a function
   of culture of the participant (Japanese versus US Caucasian), culture of
   the stimulus face (Japanese versus US Caucasian), and the relation
   between the two. We employed a previously validated paradigm to examine
   differences in neural activation in response to rapidly presented
   directversus averted-fear expressions, finding clear evidence for a
   culturally determined role of gaze in the processing of fear. Greater
   neural responsivity was apparent to averted-versus direct-gaze fear in
   several regions related to face and emotion processing, including
   bilateral amygdalae, when posed on same-culture faces, whereas greater
   response to direct-versus averted-gaze fear was apparent in these same
   regions when posed on other-culture faces. We also found preliminary
   evidence for intercultural variation including differential responses
   across participants to Japanese versus US Caucasian stimuli, and to a
   lesser degree differences in how Japanese and US Caucasian participants
   responded to these stimuli. These findings reveal a meaningful role of
   culture in the processing of eye gaze and emotion, and highlight their
   interactive influences in neural processing.}},

Abstract = {{Voting to determine one's leaders is among the most important decisions
   we make, yet little is known about the brain's role in how we come to
   these decisions. Behavioral studies have indicated that snap judgments
   of political candidates' faces can predict election outcomes but that
   the traits that lead to these judgments differ across cultures. Here we
   sought to investigate the neural basis for these judgments. American and
   Japanese natives performed simulated voting judgments of actual American
   and Japanese political candidates while neural activity was measured
   using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Candidates for whom
   participants chose to vote elicited stronger responses in the bilateral
   amygdala than candidates for whom participants chose not to vote. This
   was true regardless of either the participant's culture or the target's
   culture, suggesting that these voting decisions provoked the same neural
   response cross-culturally. In addition, we observed a participant
   culture by target culture interaction in the bilateral amygdala.
   American and Japanese participants both showed a stronger response to
   cultural outgroup faces than they did to cultural ingroup faces, however
   this was unrelated to their voting decisions. These data provide insight
   to the mechanisms that underlie our snap judgments of others when making
   voting decisions and provide a neural correlate to cross-cultural
   consensus in social inferences.}},

Abstract = {{Cultural neuroscience is an emerging research discipline that
   investigates cultural variation in psychological, neural and genomic
   processes as a means of articulating the bidirectional relationship of
   these processes and their emergent properties. Research in cultural
   neuroscience integrates theory and methods from anthropology, cultural
   psychology, neuroscience and neurogenetics. Here, we review a set of
   core theoretical and methodological challenges facing researchers when
   planning and conducting cultural neuroscience studies, and provide
   suggestions for overcoming these challenges. In particular, we focus on
   the problems of defining culture and culturally appropriate experimental
   tasks, comparing neuroimaging data acquired from different populations
   and scanner sites and identifying functional genetic polymorphisms
   relevant to culture. Implications of cultural neuroscience research for
   addressing current issues in population health disparities are
   discussed.}},

Volume = {{124}},

Abstract = {{The authors investigated the contribution of the nucleus accumbens (NAc)
   core and shell to effort-based decision making using a discounting
   procedure. Selection of 1 lever delivered a smaller, 2-pellet reward
   immediately, whereas the other lever delivered a 4-pellet reward after a
   fixed ratio of presses (2, 5, 10, or 20) that increased over 4 blocks of
   10 discrete choice trials. Subsequent testing employed an equivalent
   delays procedure, whereby the relative delay to reward delivery after
   selection of either option was equalized. In well-trained rats,
   inactivation of the core, but not the shell, via infusion of GABA MB
   agonists muscimo/baclofen reduced preference for the high-effort option
   under standard conditions and also when rats were tested using an
   equivalent delays procedure. However, inactivation of the core did not
   alter preference for 4-pellet versus 2-pellet rewards when the relative
   costs of each option were the same (1 press). Thus, the NAc core, but
   not the shell, appears to be part of a neural circuit that biases choice
   toward larger rewards associated with a greater effort cost.
   Furthermore, the contributions by the NAc core to this form of decision
   making can be dissociated from its role in delay discounting.}},

Abstract = {{Avoidance and alerting behaviors and accompanying physiological
   responses, including changes in heart rate (HR), are core components of
   negative emotion. Investigations into the neural mechanisms underlying
   the regulation and integration of these responses require animal models
   that simultaneously measure both the physiological and behavioral
   components of emotion. A primate model is of particular importance in
   view of the well developed prefrontal cortex of primates, and this
   region's critical role in emotion regulation and the etiology of
   affective disorders. Therefore, we have developed a simple aversive
   conditioning paradigm to assess, simultaneously, cardiovascular and
   behavioral responses in the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Validation of
   the paradigm was achieved by (1) comparing conditioned responses to a
   predictive cue with pseudoconditioned responses to a nonpredictive cue:
   (2) assessing the acquisition of conditioning following lesions of the
   amygdala, a region essential for associative learning in humans and
   rats; and (3) determining the contributions of the sympathetic and
   parasympathetic nervous system to the conditioned autonomic responses.
   Marmosets acquired conditioned HR and behavioral responses in the
   conditioned, but not the pseudoconditioned or amygdala lesioned groups.
   Conditioned HR accelerations were reduced by both parasympathetic and
   sympathetic blockade. Thus, a model of associative learning of mild
   negative emotion in the marmoset has been validated by psychological,
   neurological, and pharmacological investigation. Future studies will
   determine the role of the prefrontal cortex in the regulation of these
   negative emotional responses, to provide insights into the
   neuropathology of affective disorders.}},

Volume = {{124}},

Abstract = {{Previous work has demonstrated an important role for adrenergic
   receptors in memory processes in fear and drug conditioning paradigms.
   Recent studies have also demonstrated alterations in extinction in these
   paradigms using drug treatments targeting beta- and alpha(2)-adrenergic
   receptors, but little is known about the role of alpha(1)-adrenergic
   receptors in extinction. The current study examined whether antagonism
   of alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors would impair the consolidation of
   extinction in fear and cocaine conditioned place preference paradigms.
   After contextual fear conditioning, injections of the
   alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin (1.0 or 3.0 mg/kg)
   following nonreinforced context exposures slowed the loss of conditioned
   freezing over the course of 5 extinction sessions (Experiment 1). After
   cocaine place conditioning, prazosin had no effect on the rate of
   extinction over 8 nonreinforced test sessions. Following postextinction
   reconditioning, however, prazosin-treated mice showed a robust place
   preference, but vehicle-treated mice did not, suggesting that prazosin
   reduced the persistent effects of extinction (Experiment 2). These
   results confirm the involvement of the alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor in
   extinction processes in both appetitive and aversive preparations.}},

Abstract = {{Our laboratory has reported that manipulations that provoke a robust
   sodium appetite (e.g., sodium depletion, deoxycorticosterone acetate)
   decrease lateral hypothalamic self-stimulation (LHSS) reward if rats are
   denied access to hypertonic saline solutions. The following studies
   investigated the interaction between chronic sodium appetite and the
   renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system on LHSS reward. In Experiment 1,
   animals treated with the diuretic furosemide (20 mg/kg) when denied
   access to saline exhibited an increase in the current required to
   produce 50\% of the maximum LHSS response rate (ECu50) 48 hr after
   extracellular volume depletion. Furosemide-depleted rats that were
   allowed to drink 0.3 M saline after depletion, or that were treated with
   the selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist spironolactone,
   which significantly reduced sodium appetite, did not show ECu50 changes.
   In Experiment 2 chronic intracerebroventricular administration of the
   selective MR antagonist RU 28318 (10 mu g/mu l/hr) prevented decreases
   in the ECu50 induced by deoxycorticosterone acetate-no salt treatment.
   We conclude that an unresolved sodium appetite will reduce responding
   for rewards and that experimental manipulations that reduce sodium
   appetite (e.g., access to saline or blockade of MR) decrease hedonic
   deficits.}},

Title = {{Suppression of Third Ventricular NPY-Elicited Feeding Following

Abstract = {{The appetitive component of feeding is controlled by forebrain
   substrates, but the consummatory behaviors of licking, mastication, and
   swallowing are organized in the brainstem. The target of forebrain
   appetitive signals is unclear but likely includes regions of the
   medullary reticular formation (RF). This study was undertaken to
   determine the necessity of different RF regions for mastication induced
   by a descending appetitive signal. We measured solid food intake in
   response to third ventricular (3V) infusions of the orexigenic peptide
   neuropeptide Y 3-36 in awake, freely moving rats and determined whether
   focal RF infusions of the GABA(A) agonist muscimol suppressed eating. RF
   infusions were centered in either the lateral tegmental field,
   comprising the intermediate (IRt) and parvocellular (PCRt) RF, or in the
   nucleus gigantocellularis (Gi). Infusions of NPY 3-36 (5 mu g/5 mu l)
   into 3V significantly increased feeding of solid food over a 90-min
   period compared with the noninfused condition (4.3 g +/- 0.56 vs. 0.57 g
   +/- 0.57, p < .001). NPY 3-36-induced food intake was suppressed (1.7 g
   +/- 0.48) by simultaneous infusions of muscimol (0.6 mM/100 nl) into the
   IRt/PCRt (p < .01). Coincident with the decrease in feeding was a
   decrease in the amplitude of anterior digastric muscle contractions in
   response to intraoral sucrose infusions. In contrast, infusions of
   muscimol into Gi had no discernible effect on food intake or EMG
   amplitude. These data suggest that the IRt/PCRt is essential for
   forebrain-initiated mastication, but that the Gi is not a necessary link
   in this pathway.}},

Abstract = {{As one of the two main sources of brain dopamine, the ventral tegmental
   area (VTA) is important for several complex functions, including
   motivation, reward prediction, and contextual learning. Although many
   studies have identified the potential neural substrate of VTA
   dopaminergic activity in reward prediction functions during Pavlovian
   and operant conditioning tasks, less is understood about the role of VTA
   neuronal activity in motivated behaviors and more naturalistic forms of
   context-dependent learning. Therefore. VTA neural activity was recorded
   as rats performed a spatial memory task under varying contextual
   conditions. In addition to reward- and reward predicting cue-related
   firing commonly observed during conditioning tasks, the activity of a
   large proportion of VIA neurons was also related to the velocity and/or
   acceleration of the animal's movement. It is important to note that
   movement-related activity was strongest when rats displayed more
   motivation to obtain reward. Furthermore, many cells displayed a dual
   code of movement- and reward-related activity. These two modes of
   firing. however, were differentially regulated by context information,
   suggesting that movement- and reward-related firing are two
   independently regulated modes of VIA neuronal activity and may serve
   separate functions.}},

Abstract = {{In contrast to the well-established effects of stress on learning of
   declarative material, much less is known about stress effects on reward-
   or feedback-based learning. Differential effects on positive and
   negative feedback especially have received little attention. The
   objective of this study, thus, was to investigate effects of
   psychosocial stress on feedback-based learning with a particular focus
   on the use of negative and positive feedback during learning.
   Participants completed a probabilistic selection task in both a stress
   and a control condition. The task allowed quantification of how much
   participants relied on positive and negative feedback during learning.
   Although stress had no effect on general acquisition of the task,
   results indicate that participants used negative feedback significantly
   less during learning after stress compared with the control condition.
   An enhancing effect of stress on use of positive feedback failed to
   reach significance. These findings suggest that stress acts
   differentially on the use of positive and negative feedback during
   learning.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of damage to one sensory system on the functioning of
   other sensory systems has been of scientific interest for over a
   century. Recently it has been suggested that damage to the olfactory
   system (CN I) decreases the ability to taste: that is, to perceive
   sweet, sour, bitter and salty sensations via CN VII, IX, and X. If true,
   this would be in contrast to most other sensory systems, where
   compromise typically leads to either cross-modal enhancement of function
   or to no effects at all. In the present study, data from both regional
   and whole-mouth taste tests of 581 patients presenting to a smell and
   taste center with varying degrees of olfactory function were evaluated
   to address whether olfactory loss is associated with taste loss. No
   significant influence of olfactory dysfunction on any measure of taste
   perception was found when the effects of sex, age, and etiology were
   controlled. These data suggest that smell loss, per se, has no
   meaningful influence on taste function, and that clinical associations
   between smell and taste dysfunction, when observed, likely reflect
   comorbid influences.}},

Abstract = {{Auditory spatial acuity was measured in mice using prepulse inhibition
   (PPI) of the acoustic startle reflex as the indicator response for
   stimulus detection. The prepulse was a ``speaker swap{''} (SSwap),
   shifting a noise between two speakers located along the azimuth. Their
   angular separation, and the spectral composition and sound level of the
   noise were varied, as was the interstimulus interval (ISI) between SSwap
   and acoustic startle reflex elicitation. In Experiment 1 a 180 degrees
   SSwap of wide band noise (WBN) was compared with WBN Onset and Offset.
   SSwap and WBN Onset had near equal effects, but less than Offset. In
   Experiment 2 WBN SSwap was measured with speaker separations of 15,
   22.5, 45, and 90 degrees. Asymptotic level and the growth rate of PPI
   increased with increased separation from 15 to 90 degrees, but even the
   15 degrees SSwap provided significant PPI for the mean performance of
   the group. SSwap in Experiment 3 used octave band noise (2-4, 4-8, 8-16,
   or 16-32 kHz) and separations of 7.5 to 180 degrees. SSwap was most
   effective for the highest frequencies, with no significant PPI for SSwap
   below 8-16 kHz, or for separations of 7.5 degrees. In Experiment 4 SSwap
   had WBN sound levels from 40 to 78 dB SPL, and separations of 22.5, 45,
   90, and 180 : PPI increased with level, this effect varying with ISI and
   angular separation. These experiments extend the prior findings on sound
   localization in mice, and the dependence of PPI on ISI adds a reaction
   time-like dimension to this behavioral analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The ratio of the lengths of the second and fourth fingers (2D:4D) may
   serve as a marker for prenatal androgen signaling. Because people are
   typically unaware of their 2D:4D, its use allows possible effects of
   early sex hormone regimes and socialization to be disentangled. We
   conducted a meta-analysis on relationships between 2D:4D and sexual
   orientation in men and women in 18 independent samples of men and 16
   independent samples of women. Collectively, these samples comprised
   1,618 heterosexual men, 1,693 heterosexual women, 1,503 gay men, and
   1,014 lesbians. In addition to identifying the normative heterosexual
   sex difference in 2D:4D for both hands, we found that heterosexual women
   had higher (more feminine) left- and right-hand 2D:4D than did lesbians,
   but we found no difference between heterosexual and gay men. Moderator
   analyses suggested that ethnicity explained some between-studies
   variation in men. These results add to a literature suggesting that
   early sex hormone signaling affects sexual orientation in women, and
   highlight the need for further research exploring the relationships
   among 2D:4D, sexual orientation, and ethnicity in men.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies have reported that stress impairs memory retrieval, even
   though findings are not unequivocal. Moreover, memory for socially
   relevant information was not previously investigated. The present study
   aimed to test the effects of stress on the retrieval of social memory
   (e.g., memory concerning names, birthdays, or biographies). In a
   randomized cross-over experiment, the cognitive performance of 29
   subjects (15 women) was tested twice. Social memory was tested in a
   stress session, in which participants were exposed to a brief
   standardized psychosocial laboratory stressor between encoding and
   retrieval. Performance was compared with a stress-free control session.
   Stress exposure caused an increase in cortisol concentrations and
   changes in several mood measures. Social memory retrieval was reduced in
   the stress compared with the control session. An association between the
   cortisol stress response and poorer retrieval was significant in
   responders, that is, those participants displaying a cortisol rise after
   stress onset. Thus, similar to other forms of declarative memory, the
   retrieval of declarative memory for socially relevant information
   learned from biographical notes is impaired after acute stress exposure.
   This effect is linked to the stress-induced cortisol increase.}},

Abstract = {{Emotional events often lead to particularly strong memory formation.
   Corticosterone, the final product of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
   (HPA)-axis activation, has been suggested to play a critical role in
   this effect. Although a great deal of work has implicated the amygdala
   as a necessary structure for the effects of corticosterone, other
   studies have suggested a critical role for the hippocampus in
   determining the involvement of corticosterone. The current experiments
   examined this question by disrupting corticosterone synthesis with
   administration of metyrapone (25 or 100 mg/kg) prior to training in
   either dorsal hippocampus-independent delay fear conditioning or dorsal
   hippocampus-dependent trace fear conditioning. Metyrapone administration
   2 hrs prior to training significantly attenuated corticosterone
   secretion during training, but these effects were transient as
   corticosterone levels were similar to control subjects following the
   test session. As hypothesized, only trace fear conditioning was
   impaired. This suggests that only fear conditioning tasks that are
   dependent on the dorsal hippocampus require HPA-axis activation in order
   to be learned.}},

Title = {{Is Sexual Motivational State Linked to Dopamine Release in the Medial

Abstract = {{The medial preoptic area (mPOA) is a key site for the dopaminergic
   enhancement of male sexual behavior. Dopamine release increases in the
   rat mPOA with mating, supporting the critical stimulatory role played by
   preoptic dopamine on male sexual behavior. However, it has been
   questioned whether dopamine is specifically related to the occurrence of
   male sexual behavior and not simply involved in general arousal. To
   address this question, we asked whether dopamine release in the mPOA is
   linked to the production of male sexual behavior in Japanese quail
   (Coturnix japonica), a species that exhibits a much shorter temporal
   pattern of copulation than rats and does not have an intromittent organ,
   resulting in a very different topography of their sexual response.
   Extracellular samples from the mPOA of adult sexually experienced male
   quail were collected every 6 min before, during, and after exposure to a
   female using in vivo microdialysis and analyzed using high-performance
   liquid chromatography with electro-chemical detection. Extracellular
   dopamine significantly increased in the presence of a female and
   returned to baseline after removal of the female. However, quail that
   failed to copulate did not display this increased release. These
   findings indicate that it is not solely the presence of a female that
   drives dopamine release in males, but how a male responds to her.
   Furthermore, in quail that copulated, dopamine release did not change in
   samples collected during periods of no copulation. Together, these
   findings support the hypothesis that dopamine action in the mPOA is
   specifically linked to sexual motivation and not only to copulatory
   behavior or physical arousal.}},

Abstract = {{The role of electro-acupuncture (EA) stimulation on motor symptoms in
   Parkinson's disease (PD) has not been well studied. In a rat
   hemiparkinsonian model induced by unilateral transection of the medial
   forebrain bundle (MFB). EA stimulation improved motor impairment in a
   frequency-dependent manner. Whereas EA stimulation at a low frequency (2
   Hz) had no effect, EA stimulation at a high frequency (100 Hz)
   significantly improved motor coordination. However, neither low nor high
   EA stimulation could significantly enhance dopamine levels in the
   striatum. EA stimulation at 100 Hz normalized the MFB lesion-induced
   increase in midbrain GABA content, but it had no effect on GABA content
   in the globus pallidus. These results suggest that high-frequency EA
   stimulation improves motor impairment in MFB-lesioned rats by increasing
   GABAergic inhibition in the output structure of the basal ganglia.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-10}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have implicated the short allele of the serotonin
   transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) in depression
   vulnerability, particularly in the context of stress. Several
   neuroimaging studies have shown that 5-HTTLPR genotype predicts amygdala
   reactivity to negatively valenced stimuli, suggesting a mechanism
   whereby the short allele confers depression risk. The current study
   investigated whether 5-HTTLPR genotype similarly affects neural activity
   during an induced sad mood and during recovery from sad mood.
   Participants were 15 homozygous short (S) and 15 homozygous long (L)
   individuals. Regional cerebral blood flow was measured with perfusion
   functional magnetic resonance imaging during four scanning blocks:
   baseline, sad mood, mood recovery and following return to baseline.
   Comparing mood recovery to baseline, both whole brain analyses and
   template-based region-of-interest analyses revealed greater amygdala
   activity for the S vs the L-group. There were no significant amygdala
   differences found during the induced sad mood. These results demonstrate
   the effect of the S allele on amygdala activity during intentional mood
   regulation and suggest that amygdala hyperactivity during recovery from
   a sad mood may be one mechanism by which the S allele confers depression
   risk.}},

Abstract = {{Stress has significant adverse effects on health and is a risk factor
   for many illnesses. Neurobiological studies have implicated the amygdala
   as a brain structure crucial in stress responses. Whereas hyperactive
   amygdala function is often observed during stress conditions,
   cross-sectional reports of differences in gray matter structure have
   been less consistent. We conducted a longitudinal MRI study to
   investigate the relationship between changes in perceived stress with
   changes in amygdala gray matter density following a stress-reduction
   intervention. Stressed but otherwise healthy individuals (N = 26)
   participated in an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction
   intervention. Perceived stress was rated on the perceived stress scale
   (PSS) and anatomical MR images were acquired pre- and post-intervention.
   PSS change was used as the predictive regressor for changes in gray
   matter density within the bilateral amygdalae. Following the
   intervention, participants reported significantly reduced perceived
   stress. Reductions in perceived stress correlated positively with
   decreases in right basolateral amygdala gray matter density. Whereas
   prior studies found gray matter modifications resulting from acquisition
   of abstract information, motor and language skills, this study
   demonstrates that neuroplastic changes are associated with improvements
   in a psychological state variable.}},

Abstract = {{The reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST) proposed the behavioral
   activation system (BAS) as a neurobehavioral system that is dependent on
   dopamine-irrigated structures and that mediates the individual
   differences in sensitivity and reactivity to appetitive stimuli
   associated with BAS-related personality traits. Theoretical developments
   propose that high BAS sensitivity is associated with both enhanced
   appetitive stimuli processing and the diminished processing of aversive
   stimuli. The objective of this study was to analyze how individual
   differences in BAS functioning were associated with brain activation
   during erotic and aversive picture processing while subjects were
   involved in a simple goal-directed task. Forty-five male participants
   took part in this study. The task activation results confirm the
   activation of the reward and punishment brain-related structures while
   viewing erotic and aversive pictures, respectively. The SR scores show a
   positive correlation with activation of the left lateral prefrontal
   cortex, the mesial prefrontal cortex and the right occipital cortex
   while viewing erotic pictures, and a negative correlation with the right
   lateral prefrontal cortex and the left occipital cortex while viewing
   aversive pictures. In summary, the SR scores modulate the activity of
   the cortical areas in the prefrontal and the occipital cortices that are
   proposed to modulate the BAS and the BIS-FFFS.}},

Abstract = {{In the literature, a lack of attentional bias in blood phobia has been
   reported, using both behavioral and ERP measures. However, in the tasks
   employed so far, attentional resources to single stimuli, rather than
   attentional selection, were evaluated. The present study investigated
   whether in blood phobics disorder-relevant pictures can capture
   visuo-spatial attention when paired with neutral or non-specific
   unpleasant pictures (attack), and participants have to focus on a visual
   detection task. The N2pc component of the ERPs was measured as an index
   of spatial attentional selection. Results showed that in blood phobics,
   but not in controls, injuries elicited a larger early N2pc than attack
   pictures when paired with neutral material. Moreover, only in blood
   phobics a reliable N2pc to injury-attack pairs was found. The late N2pc
   reversal to injury pictures suggests that early orienting to phobic cues
   was followed by cognitive avoidance.}},

Abstract = {{Recent findings associate attachment insecurity (assessed as levels of
   attachment anxiety and avoidance) with poor emotion regulation. In turn,
   emotion regulation has been shown to be associated with hippocampus (HC)
   functioning and structure. Clinical disorders such as depression and
   PTSD, which have been previously associated with attachment insecurity,
   are also known to be linked with reduced hippocampal cell density. This
   suggests that attachment insecurity may also be associated with reduced
   hippocampal cell density. We examined this hypothesis using T1 images of
   22 healthy young adults. In line with our hypothesis, attachment
   avoidance was associated with bilateral HC reduction, whereas attachment
   anxiety was significantly related to reduced cell concentration in the
   left HC. The findings are compatible with a neurotoxical model of
   stress-induced cell reduction in the HC, providing further information
   on emotion regulation abilities among insecurely attached individuals.}},

Abstract = {{A major controversy in the social cognitive neurosciences evolved around
   the question whether activity in the posterior superior temporal sulcus
   and adjacent temporoparietal junction (pSTS/TPJ-region) evoked by
   various tasks represents a common process or distinct processes. To
   investigate this question, we employed functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) while participants performed Biological Motion (BM),
   Theory-of-Mind (ToM) and Moral Judgment (MJ) tasks. Importantly, for
   each task we used the same newly developed animated stimuli. Indicative
   of a common process, we identified small clusters of overlapping
   activity for BM and ToM in right pSTS and for ToM and MJ in bilateral
   pSTS and left TPJ. Indicative of distinct processes, on the contrary, we
   detected extensive dissociable activity for BM in right pSTS, for ToM in
   bilateral pSTS and left TPJ, and for MJ in bilateral pSTS and TPJ. Thus,
   our data provide strong evidence for a combined two-staged process
   account: (i) the parsing of a stream of visual-spatial information,
   represented by activity in right pSTS, where neighboring and overlapping
   clusters of increased responses were found for all three tasks; (ii)
   increasingly more complex processing of the communicative significance
   of other people's behavior, represented by hierarchically increasing
   activity in left pSTS and bilateral TPJ elicited by ToM and MJ.}},

Abstract = {{Adult psychopaths have deficits in emotional processing and inhibitory
   control, engage in morally inappropriate behavior, and generally fail to
   distinguish moral from conventional violations. These observations,
   together with a dominant tradition in the discipline which sees
   emotional processes as causally necessary for moral judgment, have led
   to the conclusion that psychopaths lack an understanding of moral rights
   and wrongs. We test an alternative explanation: psychopaths have normal
   understanding of right and wrong, but abnormal regulation of morally
   appropriate behavior. We presented psychopaths with moral dilemmas,
   contrasting their judgments with age- and sex-matched (i) healthy
   subjects and (ii) non-psychopathic, delinquents. Subjects in each group
   judged cases of personal harms (i.e. requiring physical contact) as less
   permissible than impersonal harms, even though both types of harms led
   to utilitarian gains. Importantly, however, psychopaths' pattern of
   judgments on different dilemmas was the same as those of the other
   subjects. These results force a rejection of the strong hypothesis that
   emotional processes are causally necessary for judgments of moral
   dilemmas, suggesting instead that psychopaths understand the distinction
   between right and wrong, but do not care about such knowledge, or the
   consequences that ensue from their morally inappropriate behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies have revealed a consistent overlap between brain
   regions involved in self-processing and those implicated in
   autobiographical memory. However, no study has directly tested how the
   degree of self-involvement with an event being remembered alters the
   neural circuitry engaged during memory retrieval. The present study
   compared hockey players' memories for game elements in which they were
   highly involved (e.g. scoring a goal) versus less involved (e.g.
   watching a goal from the bench). Specifically, we examined how the
   effective connectivity of a network of brain regions known to be
   involved in autobiographical memory retrieval varied based upon the
   players' level of self-involvement with the remembered event. During
   remembering of high self-involvement events, connections between the
   left hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex were `in synchrony' with
   connections between the medial prefrontal cortex and the right
   amygdala-hippocampal complex. By contrast, the hippocampal-prefrontal
   connection was `out-of-sync' with the prefrontal-amygdala connection
   during retrieval of low self-involvement memories. This result is
   discussed in terms of two memory systems (one that is hippocampal-based
   and one that is amygdala-hippocampal-based) that may be involved to
   varying degrees depending upon the characteristics of a remembered
   event.}},

   ingroup (White) and outgroup (Black) faces according to expression
   (happy vs angry) following either MS or a control induction. Results
   showed that MS affected the amplitude of the P2 and N2 components
   elicited by ingroup faces but had no effect on the processing of
   outgroup faces. Processing of angry ingroup relative to angry outgroup
   faces was pronounced in the MS condition, reflected both in N2 amplitude
   and in longer latency of the P3 component, suggesting heightened
   sensitivity to threats to positive ingroup. Overall, findings suggest
   that MS intensifies perception of social category features, primarily by
   enhancing processing of ingroup cues.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{88-97}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Event-related potentials were recorded from adults and 4-month-old
   infants while they watched pictures of faces that varied in emotional
   expression (happy and fearful) and in gaze direction (direct or
   averted). Results indicate that emotional expression is temporally
   independent of gaze direction processing at early stages of processing,
   and only become integrated at later latencies. Facial expressions
   affected the face-sensitive ERP components in both adults (N170) and
   infants (N290 and P400), while gaze direction and the interaction
   between facial expression and gaze affected the posterior channels in
   adults and the frontocentral channels in infants. Specifically, in
   adults, this interaction reflected a greater responsiveness to fearful
   expressions with averted gaze (avoidance-oriented emotion), and to happy
   faces with direct gaze (approach-oriented emotions). In infants, a
   larger activation to a happy expression at the frontocentral negative
   component (Nc) was found, and planned comparisons showed that it was due
   to the direct gaze condition. Taken together, these results support the
   shared signal hypothesis in adults, but only to a lesser extent in
   infants, suggesting that experience could play an important role.}},

Abstract = {{The field of social neuroscience has made remarkable progress in
   elucidating the neural mechanisms of social cognition. More recently,
   the need for new experimental approaches has been highlighted that allow
   studying social encounters in a truly interactive manner by establishing
   `online' reciprocity in social interaction. In this article, we present
   a newly developed adaptation of a method which uses eyetracking data
   obtained from participants in real time to control visual stimulation
   during functional magnetic resonance imaging, thus, providing an
   innovative tool to generate gaze-contingent stimuli in spite of the
   constraints of this experimental setting. We review results of two
   paradigms employing this technique and demonstrate how gaze data can be
   used to animate a virtual character whose behavior becomes `responsive'
   to being looked at allowing the participant to engage in `online'
   interaction with this virtual other in real-time. Possible applications
   of this setup are discussed highlighting the potential of this
   development as a new `tool of the trade' in social cognitive and

Abstract = {{Studies of neuropsychological patients and experimental animals have
   demonstrated that the striatum plays a role in implicit habit learning.
   Here, we examined the performance of patients with Parkinson's disease
   (PD) on a concurrent discrimination task that can be learned implicitly
   by neurologically intact individuals. Participants viewed a pair of
   shapes on each trial and, under a timed deadline, guessed which one
   concealed a smiling face. About half the control participants exhibited
   minimal awareness of the cue-reward relationships as assessed by a
   post-test evaluation. Nevertheless, these participants were able to
   perform the discrimination task; there was no correlation between
   awareness and performance on the task. In contrast, minimally aware
   patients with PD showed no learning, whereas those who were more aware
   of the relationships performed as well as control participants on the
   task. There was a significant correlation between awareness and
   performance in patients with PD. These data support the idea that the
   basal ganglia play a role in implicit habit learning and underscore the
   importance of using tests of awareness to assess the content and process
   of learning in humans.}},

Abstract = {{The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is critically involved in
   neuroplasticity, as well as the acquisition. consolidation, and
   retention of hippocampal- and amygdala-dependent learning. A common
   functional A -> G single nucleotide polymorphism (BDNFval66met) in the
   prodomain of the human BDNF gene is associated with abnormal
   intracellular trafficking and reduced activity-dependent BDNF release.
   We studied the effect of BDNFval66met in an aversive differential fear
   conditioning, and a delayed extinction paradigm in 57 healthy
   participants. Pictures of male faces were used as stimuli and fear
   learning was quantified by fear potentiated startle (FPS) and skin
   conductance responses (SCR).
   Aware BDNF met-carriers show a deficit in amygdala-dependent fear
   conditioning as indicated by an absence of FPS responses in the last
   acquisition block. This deficit was maintained in the first block of
   extinction. No genotype differences were found in conditioned SCR
   discrimination. These data provide evidence for the involvement of BDNF
   signaling in human amygdala-dependent learning. We suggest that the BDNF
   met-allele may have a protective effect for the development of affective
   pathologies that may be mediated via reduced synaptic plasticity induced
   by negative experience.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescence is associated with the development of brain regions linked
   to cognition and emotion. Such changes are thought to contribute to the
   behavioral and neuropsychiatric vulnerabilities of this period. We
   compared adolescent (Postnatal Days 28-42) and adult (Postnatal Day 60+)
   rats as they performed a simple instrumental task and extinction. Rats
   were trained to poke into a hole for a food-pellet reinforcer. After six
   days of training, rats underwent extinction sessions in which the
   previously rewarded behavior was no longer reinforced. During
   extinction, we examined the effects of continued presentation of a cue
   light and food restriction. Adults and adolescents exhibited similar
   performance during training, although adolescents made more
   task-irrelevant pokes, consistent with increased exploration. Adults
   made more premature pokes, which could indicate a more exclusive focus
   on the task. During extinction, adolescents made more perseverative
   (previously reinforced) pokes than adults. This behavior was strongly
   modulated by the combination of motivational factors present (food
   restriction and cue light), indicating that adolescents were
   differentially sensitive to them. Furthermore, food restriction induced
   greater open-field activity in adolescents but not in adults. Thus, as
   the neural circuitry of motivated behavior develops substantially during
   adolescence, so too does the behavioral sensitivity to motivational
   factors. Understanding how such factors differently affect adolescents
   may shed light on mechanisms that lead to the development of disorders
   that are manifested during this period.}},

Abstract = {{The present series of experiments aimed to pinpoint the source of
   nucleus accumbens core (AcbC) effects on delay discounting. Rats were
   trained with an impulsive choice procedure between an adjusting smaller
   sooner reward and a fixed larger later reward. The AcbC-lesioned rats
   produced appropriate choice behavior when the reward magnitude was
   equal. An increase in reward magnitude resulted in a failure to increase
   preference for the larger later reward in the AcbC-lesioned rats,
   whereas a decrease in the larger later reward duration resulted in
   normal alterations in choice behavior in AcbC-lesioned rats. Subsequent
   experiments with a peak timing (Experiments 2 and 3) and a behavioral
   contrast (Experiment 4) indicated that the AcbC-lesioned rats suffered
   from decreased incentive motivation during changes in reward magnitude
   (Experiments 2 and 4) and when expected rewards were omitted
   (Experiments 2 and 3), but displayed intact anticipatory timing of
   reward delays (Experiments 2 and 3). The results indicate that the
   nucleus accumbens core is critical for determining the incentive value
   of rewards, but does not participate in the timing of reward delays.}},

Abstract = {{Previous work has implicated the cholinergic system in modulating
   feeding behavior; however, its specific function remains unclear. This
   work aims to characterize potential dissociations between the central
   cholinergic modulation of the incentive properties of food and
   food-associated cues, and consummatory behaviors. Three separate
   experiments demonstrated that intra-accumbens infusion of the muscarinic
   antagonist scopolamine 3 hr before the testing session significantly
   decreased food intake. General motor activity in anticipation of food
   was not diminished. Experiments also showed that scopolamine did not
   impair operant responding for a food-associated conditioned reinforcer
   (CR), nor was d-amphetamine potentiation of CR responding altered by
   scopolamine pretreatment. This study contributes to the growing evidence
   that goal-seeking behaviors are mediated by a set of neural processes
   distinct from those governing food reward.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{124}},

Abstract = {{Rats with perirhinal cortex lesions were sequentially trained in a
   rectangular water tank on a series of 3 visual discriminations, each
   between mirror-imaged stimuli. When these same discriminations were
   tested concurrently, the rats were forced to use a configural strategy
   to solve the problems effectively. There was no evidence that lesions of
   the perirhinal cortex disrupted the ability to learn the concurrent
   configural discrimination task, which required the rats to learn the
   precise combination of stimulus identity with stimulus placement
   ({''}structural{''} learning). The same rats with perirhinal cortex
   lesions were also unimpaired on a test of spatial working memory
   (reinforced T maze alternation), although they were markedly impaired on
   a new test of spontaneous object recognition. For the recognition test,
   rats received multiple trials within a single session in which on every
   trial, they were allowed to explore 2 objects, I familiar, the other
   novel. On the basis of their differential exploration times, rats with
   perirhinal cortex lesions showed very poor discrimination of the novel
   objects, thereby confirming the effectiveness of the surgery. The
   discovery that bilateral lesions of the perirhinal cortex can leave
   configural (structural) learning seemingly unaffected points to a need
   to refine those models of perirhinal cortex function that emphasize its
   role in representing conjunctions of stimulus features.}},

Abstract = {{Sleep pressure and rebound comprise the two compensatory or
   ``homeostatic{''} responses to sleep deprivation. Although sleep
   pressure is expressed by infant rats as early as postnatal day (P)5,
   sleep rebound does not appear to emerge until after P11. We reexamined
   the developmental expression of these sleep-regulatory processes in P2
   and P8 rats by depriving them of sleep for 30 min using a cold, arousing
   stimulus delivered to a cold-sensitive re,,ion of the snout. This method
   effectively increased sleep pressure over the 30-min period (i.e.,
   increases in the number of arousing stimuli presented over time).
   Moreover, sleep rebound (i.e., increased sleep during the recovery
   period) is demonstrated for the first time at these ages. Next, we
   showed that precollicular transections in P2 rats prevent sleep rebound
   without affecting sleep pressure, Suggesting that the brainstem is
   sufficient to support sleep pressure, but sleep rebound depends on
   neural mechanisms that lie rostral to the transection. Finally, again in
   P2 rats, we used c-fos immunohistochemistry to examine neural activation
   throughout the neuraxis during sleep deprivation and recovery. Sleep
   deprivation and rebound were accompanied by significant increases in
   neural activation in both brainstem and hypothalamic nuclei, including
   the ventrolateral preoptic area and median preoptic nucleus. This early
   developmental expression of sleep pressure and rebound and the apparent
   involvement of brainstem and hypothalamic structures in their expression
   further solidify the notion that sleep-wake processes in
   newborns-defined at these ages without reference to state-dependent EEG
   activity-provide the foundation on which the more familiar processes of
   adults are built.}},

Abstract = {{Newly formed memories are initially fragile and require consolidation to
   be transformed into an enduring state. Memory consolidation may occur
   during increased postlearning REM sleep. REM deprivation during these
   periods (termed REM sleep windows {[}RSWs]) impairs subsequent
   performance. The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPT) and adjacent deep
   mesencephalic reticular nuclei (DpMe) have been implicated in the
   generation of REM sleep. Following 24-hr baseline recording, rats were
   trained on the 2-way avoidance task for 50 trials/day over 2 days and
   retested on Day 3. EEG was recorded 22 hr after training on training
   Days 1 and 2. Rats were injected with the GABA(B) agonist baclofen or
   saline into the PPT/DpMe region at 0300 to coincide with the start of a
   known RSW. Based on shuttle performance, saline rats were assigned post
   hoc to a learning group (LG) that avoided the footshock at least 60\% at
   retest or nonlearning group (NLG) that performed below this criterion.
   Baclofen-injected rats were not assigned post hoc into separate groups
   as all rats performed below the learning criterion. PPN/DpMe infusions
   of the inhibitory GABA(B) agonist baclofen decreased REM and impaired
   subsequent memory performance. Normal GABAergic transmission in the
   PPN/DpMe may be necessary for REM to occur and for the consolidation of
   incentive learning.}},

Abstract = {{Within the mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus, multiple oscillators
   interact to coordinate circadian rhythms in behavior and physiology. We
   have developed a behavioral assay that disassociates central oscillators
   and allows rigorous study of their formal properties and interactions.
   Rodents held under 24h light:dark:light:dark (LDLD) cycles display
   ``split{''} activity rhythms that reflect the reorganization of the
   central pacemaker into two oscillator groups cycling similar to 12h
   apart. After transfer to constant conditions, the two activity
   components rejoin through a series of transients lasting 2-7 days. Here
   we analyze fusion dynamics, characterize the underlying oscillator
   interactions, and assess two influencing factors: phase of transfer and
   lighting conditions upon transfer. Syrian hamsters were split under LDLD
   with dimly lit nights and then transferred to constant dim illumination
   or complete darkness during one of the two daily scotophases. Fusion was
   influenced by phase of transfer, suggesting that the oscillators split
   under LDLD exert an asymmetric influence over one another. Transfer to
   constant dim and dark conditions produced similar overall patterns of
   fusion, but nevertheless differed in the rejoined state of the system.
   The present results are discussed within a model wherein oscillators
   influence one another in a phase-dependent manner.}},

Abstract = {{The present research investigated the hypothesis that the hippocampus is
   involved with the control of appetitive behavior by interoceptive
   ``hunger{''} and ``satiety{''} signals. Rats were trained to solve a
   food deprivation intensity discrimination problem in which stimuli
   produced by 0-hr and 24-hr food deprivation served as discriminative
   cues for the delivery of sucrose pellets. For Group 0+, sucrose pellets
   were delivered at the conclusion of each 4-min session that took place
   under 0-hr food deprivation, whereas no pellets were delivered during
   sessions that took place when the rats had been food deprived for 24 hr.
   Group 24+ received the reverse discriminative contingency (i.e., they
   received sucrose pellets under 24-hr but not under 0-hr food
   deprivation). When asymptotic discrimination performance was achieved
   (indexed by greater incidence of food magazine approach behavior on
   reinforced compared with nonreinforced sessions), half of the rats in
   each group received hippocampal lesions, and the remaining rats in each
   group were designated as sham- or nonlesioned controls. Following
   recovery from surgery, food deprivation discrimination performance was
   compared for lesioned and control rats in both Groups 0+ and 24+.
   Discriminative responding was impaired for rats with hippocampal lesions
   relative to their controls. This impairment was based largely on
   elevated responding to nonreinforced food deprivation cues. In addition,
   hippocampal damage was associated with increased body weight under
   conditions of ad libitum feeding. The results suggest that the
   inhibition of appetitive behavior by energy state signals may depend, in
   part, on the hippocampus.}},

Abstract = {{Caloric restriction (CR), primarily known for extending life span, has
   proven anticonvulsant in several seizure models and antiepileptogenic in
   a strain of inherently seizure susceptible mice. Our animal model
   consisted of a seizure-prone (Fast) strain that naturally exhibits
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like behaviors and a
   comparison seizure-resistant (Slow) strain; we evaluated CR's effect on
   the typical seizure sensitivities and behavioral profiles of each
   strain. Fast and Slow rats were fed ad libitum or were calorically
   restricted to 80\% of free-feeding body weight. Rats were then tested in
   the open field (hyperactivity), Morris water maze (learning and
   attention), and restraint (impulsivity) paradigms and finally kindled
   from the amygdala. Ultimately, CR abolished signs of abnormal
   hyperactivity in the Fast strain and retarded their kindling rates,
   making it the first manipulation to demonstrate an antiepileptogenic
   effect in this animal model. CR also shortened seizure durations in
   fully kindled Slow rats but had no effect on their kindling rates,
   implying a differential effect of CR on genotype. These results clearly
   endorse further investigation into the potential benefits of CR for both
   epilepsy and ADHD.}},

Abstract = {{Cholesterol and sulfatides play many important roles in learning and
   memory. To date, our observations about the effects of cholesterol on
   learning have been assessed during response acquisition; that is, the
   learning of a new memory. Here, we report for the first time to our
   knowledge, on the effect of a cholesterol diet on a previously formed
   memory. Rabbits were given trace conditioning of the nictitating
   membrane response for 10 days, then fed a 2\% cholesterol diet for 8
   weeks, and then assessed for memory recall of the initially learned
   task. We show that dietary cholesterol had an adverse effect on memory
   recall. Second, we investigated whether dietary cholesterol caused an
   increase in brain cholesterol and sulfatide levels in four major brain
   structures (hippocampus, frontal lobe, brainstem, and cerebellum) using
   a technique for analyzing myelin and myelin-free fractions separately.
   Although our data confirm previous findings that dietary cholesterol.
   does not directly affect cholesterol and establish that it does not
   affect sulfatide levels in the brain, these levels did increase rather
   significantly in the hippocampus and frontal lobe as a function of
   learning and memory.}},

Abstract = {{Following stroke-like lesions to the sensorimotor cortex in rats,
   experience with the ipsi-to-lesion (ipsilesional), ``nonparetic{''},
   forelimb worsens deficits in the contralesional, ``paretic{''},
   forelimb. We tested whether the maladaptive effects of experience with
   the nonparetic limb are mediated through callosal connections and the
   contralesional sensorimotor cortex. Adult male rats with proficiency in
   skilled reaching with their dominant (for reaching) forelimb received
   ischemic bilateral sensorimotor cortex lesions, or unilateral lesions,
   with or without callosal transections. After assessing dominant forelimb
   function (the paretic forelimb in rats with unilateral lesions), animals
   were trained with their nonparetic/nondominant forelimb or underwent
   control procedures for 15 days, Animals were then tested with their
   paretic/dominant forelimb. In animals with unilateral lesions only,
   nonparetic forelimb training worsened subsequent performance with the
   paretic, forelimb, as found previously. This effect was not found in
   animals with both callosal transections and unilateral lesions. After
   bilateral lesions, training the nondominant limb did not worsen function
   of the dominant limb compared with controls. Thus, the maladaptive
   effects of training the nonparetic limb on paretic forelimb function
   depend upon the contralesional cortex and transcallosal projections.
   This suggests that this experience-dependent disruption of functional
   recovery is mediated through interhemispheric connections of the
   sensorimotor cortex.}},

Abstract = {{Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is an operational measure of sensorimotor
   gating that is thought to probe preattentional filtering mechanisms. PPI
   is deficient in several neuropsychiatric disorders, possibly reflecting
   abnormalities in frontal-cortical-striatal circuitry. Several studies
   support the predictive validity of animal PPI to model human
   sensorimotor gating phenomena but only limited studies have addressed
   the effects of aging. Studies in humans suggest that PPI is improved or
   unaffected as humans age (>60 years) and does not correlate with
   cognitive decline in aged populations. Rodent studies to date, however,
   suggest that PPI declines with age. Here we tested the hypothesis that
   PPI measures in rodents are sensitive to stimulus modality, with the
   prediction that intact sensory modalities in aged animals would be
   predictive of aging-induced increases in PPI. To test our hypothesis, we
   assessed PPI using acoustic, tactile, and visual prepulses in young (4
   month) and old (23 month) C57BL/6N mice. Consistent with data across
   species, we observed reduced startle reactivity in older mice. Aging
   effects on PPI interacted significantly with prepulse modality, with
   deficient acoustic PPI but increased visual and tactile PPI in aged
   animals. These data are therefore consistent with PPI studies in older
   humans when controlling for hearing impairments. The results are
   discussed in terms of 1) cross-species translational validity for mouse
   PPI testing, 2) the need for startle reactivity differences to be
   accounted for in PPI analyses, and 3) the utility of cross-modal PPI
   testing in subjects where hearing loss has been documented.}},

Abstract = {{The conditioned rewarding effects of novelty compete with those of
   cocaine for control over choice behavior using a place conditioning
   task. The purpose of the present study was to use multiple doses of
   cocaine to determine the extent of this competition and to determine
   whether novelty's impact on cocaine reward was maintained over an
   abstinence period. In Experiment 1, rats were conditioned with cocaine
   (7.5, 20, or 30 mg/kg ip) to prefer one side of an unbiased place
   conditioning apparatus relative to the other. In a subsequent phase, all
   rats received alternating daily confinements to the previously cocaine
   paired and Impaired sides of the apparatus. During this phase, half the
   rats had access to a novel object on their initially impaired side; the
   remaining rats did not receive objects. The ability of novelty to
   compete with cocaine in a drug free and cocaine challenge test was
   sensitive to cocaine dose. In Experiment 2, a place preference was
   established with 10 mg/kg cocaine and testing occurred after 1, 14, or
   28 day retention intervals. Findings indicate that choice behaviors
   mediated by cocaine conditioning are reduced with the passing of time.
   Taken together, competition between cocaine and novelty conditioned
   rewards are sensitive to drug dose and retention interval.}},

Abstract = {{The role of the thalamus in memory is potentially very complex. However,
   most studies on the memory impairments of thalamic lesions have focused
   on retrospective memory, rarely on prospective memory. To explore the
   effect of thalamic lesions on event-based prospective memory (EBPM) and
   time-based prospective memory (TBPM), respectively, and to verify the
   hypothesis that the thalamus is involved in the prospective memory, EBPM
   and TBPM tasks were administered to 18 thalamic stroke patients and 18
   age-and education-matched healthy controls. In the EBPM task, subjects
   were asked to perform an action whenever particular words were
   presented. In the TBPM task, subjects were asked to perform an action at
   certain times. Compared with the performance of healthy controls on EBPM
   and TBPM tasks (EBPM. 4.3 +/- 1.5 TBPM, 5.4 +/- 1.0), there was a
   significant difference in the performance of thalamic stroke patients in
   the TBPM tasks (2.4 +/- 1.6), but no difference was found in EBPM
   tasks(3.7 +/- 1.1). These results may indicate that the thalamus is
   involved in PM and particularly in TBPM.}},

Abstract = {{The neuropeptide arginine vasopressin (AVP) modulates a variety of
   species-specific social behaviors. In socially monogamous male Prairie
   voles, AVP acts centrally via vasopressin V1a receptor (V1aR) to
   facilitate mating induced partner preferences. The display of a partner
   preference requires at least 2 temporally distinct processes: social
   bond formation as well as its recall, or expression. Studies to date
   have not determined in which of these processes V1aR acts to promote
   partner preferences. Here, male prairie voles were administered
   intracerebroventricularly a V1aR antagonist (AVPA) at different time
   points to investigate the role of V1aR in social bond formation and
   expression. Animals receiving AVPA prior to cohabitation with mating or
   immediately prior to partner preference testing failed to display a
   partner preference, while animals receiving AVPA immediately after
   cohabitation with mating and control animals receiving vehicle at all 3
   time points displayed partner preferences. These results suggest that
   V1aR signaling is necessary for both the formation and expression of
   partner preferences and that these processes are dissociable.}},

Abstract = {{Path integration, the ability to maintain a representation of location
   and direction on the basis of internal cues, is thought to be important
   for navigation and the learning of spatial relationships.
   Representations of location and direction in the brain. such as head
   direction cells, grid cells, and place cells in the limbic system, are
   thought to underlie navigation by path integration. While this idea is
   generally consistent with lesion studies, the relationship between such
   neural activity and behavior has not been studied on a task where
   animals demonstrably use a path integration strategy. Here we report the
   development of such a task in rats: by slowly rotating rats before their
   return to a trial-unique home base, we could show subjects relied on
   internal cues only to navigate. To illustrate how this task can be
   combined with recording, we show examples of simultaneously recorded
   head direction cells in which neural activity is closely related to
   rats' homing direction. These results support the notion that rats can
   navigate by path integration, that this ability depends on head
   direction cells, and suggest a convenient behavioral paradigm for
   investigating the neural basis of navigation.}},

Abstract = {{Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been successfully used in the
   treatment of depression, particularly when the illness is refractory to
   pharmacological therapy. A recent study has shown that ECT is also
   effective in reducing both depressive and posttraumatic stress disorder
   (PTSD) symptoms in patients with major depression (MDD) and co-occurring
   PTSD, This raises the possibility that ECT might be effective in the
   treatment of PTSD, a disease whose prevalence has increased
   substantially in recent years. A characteristic symptom of PTSD is an
   exaggerated reactivity to startling sounds (acoustic startle responses
   ASR). In the present study, we investigated the effects of
   electroconvulsive shocks (ECS) on the ASR. in a rat model of traumatic
   stress. The animals were subjected to a restraint/tailshock paradigm and
   then administered ECS. ASR measurements were obtained at several time
   points following ECS administration. Although ECS had no effect in
   control rats, it significantly exacerbated the already potentiated ASR
   in the stressed group. While ECT may prove to be an effective treatment
   for certain symptoms of co-occurring MDD/PTSD or PTSD alone, it may
   exacerbate heightened arousal associated with PTSD.}},

Abstract = {{With the aim of understanding how different mental or intentional states
   are processed in the brain, the present functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) study examined the brain correlates during the ascription
   of belief intentional states relative to desire intentional states as
   well as the effect of incongruent relative to congruent intentional
   states. To this end, sentences containing scenarios were presented to
   participants and their task was to make judgments concerning the
   ascription of intentional states based on this information. Belief
   ascriptions, relative to desire ascriptions, were accompanied by
   activations in lateral prefrontal structures that include areas known to
   be involved in relational and conceptual reasoning. Desire ascriptions,
   in contrast, were accompanied by activations in regions of the medial
   prefrontal cortex, superior temporal gyri and hippocampal formation, all
   of which are known for their involvement in self-referential,
   autobiographical and episodic memory-relevant processes. In addition,
   the ascription of intentional states that were incongruent with reality
   (false beliefs and unfulfilled desires) was compared to the ascription
   of intentional states that were congruent to reality (true belief and
   fulfilled desires). While no brain region was selectively activated
   during the processing of unfulfilled desires, the processing of false
   beliefs was associated with stronger activations in the dorsal medial
   prefrontal cortex, an area that has been previously linked to the
   process of decoupling in false belief attribution. These findings
   provide new insights into more fine-grained aspects of mental state
   reasoning.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{19-29}},
Abstract = {{Recent neuroimaging studies on otheory of mindo have demonstrated that
   the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) is involved when subjects are engaged
   in various kinds of mentalising tasks. Although a large number of
   neuroimaging studies have been published, a relatively small amount of
   neuropsychological evidence supports involvement of the medial PFC in
   theory of mind reasoning. We recruited two neurological cases with
   damage to the medial PFC and initially performed the standard
   neuropsychological assessments for intelligence, memory, and executive
   functions. To examine theory of mind performance in these two cases,
   four kinds of standard and advanced tests for theory of mind were used,
   including first- and second-order false belief tests, the strange
   stories test, and the faux pas recognition test. Both patients were also
   requested to complete the questionnaire for the autism-spectrum
   quotient. Neither case showed impairment on standard theory of mind
   tests and only mild impairments were seen on advanced theory of mind
   tests. This pattern of results is basically consistent with previous
   studies. The most interesting finding was that both cases showed
   personality changes after surgical operations, leading to
   characteristics of autism showing a lack of social interaction in
   everyday life. We discuss herein the possible roles of the medial PFC
   and emphasize the importance of using multiple approaches to understand
   the mechanisms of theory of mind and medial prefrontal functions.}},

Pages = {{30-39}},
Abstract = {{Previous research demonstrated that young infants' neural processing of
   novel objects is enhanced by a fearful face gazing toward the object.
   The current event-related potential (ERP) study addresses the question
   of whether this effect is driven by the particular threat-value of a
   fearful expression or whether a positive emotion could elicit a similar
   response. Three-month-old infants' brain responses were measured while
   infants were presented with happy and neutral faces gazing toward
   simultaneously presented objects (Experiment 1) or happy and neutral
   faces gazing away from objects (Experiment 2). Then the objects were
   presented again without the face. While infants showed an increased
   neural response for happy relative to neutral faces looking towards
   objects, infants did not differentiate between happy and neutral faces
   gazing away from the objects. Furthermore, infants showed no different
   response to objects alone in Experiment 1. However, infants responded
   with an increased negative central component (Nc) indicating increased
   attention for objects in the neutral face condition in Experiment 2. The
   current results confirm previous findings showing that infants allocate
   increased attention to an emotional face if it directs eye gaze toward
   an object in the environment. However, a happy expression does not
   increase subsequent processing of the gaze-cued object. The findings are
   discussed in terms of early social cognitive development.}},

Title = {{Effect of motion smoothness on brain activity while observing a dance:
   An fMRI study using a humanoid robot}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{40-58}},
Abstract = {{Motion smoothness is critical in transmitting implicit information of
   body action, such as aesthetic qualities in dance performances. We
   expected that the perception of motion smoothness would be characterized
   by great intersubject variability deriving from differences in personal
   backgrounds and attitudes toward expressive body actions. We used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging and a humanoid robot to
   investigate the effects of the motion smoothness of expressive body
   actions and the intersubject variability due to personal attitudes on
   perceptions during dance observation. The effect of motion smoothness
   was analyzed by both conventional subtraction analysis and functional
   connectivity analyses that detect cortical networks reflecting
   intersubject variability. The results showed that the cortical networks
   of motion- and body-sensitive visual areas showed increases in activity
   in areas corresponding with motion smoothness, but the intersubject
   variability of personal attitudes toward art did not influence these
   active areas. In contrast, activation of cortical networks, including
   the parieto-frontal network, has large intersubject variability, and
   this variability is associated with personal attitudes about the
   consciousness of art. Thus, our results suggest that activity in the
   cortical network involved in understanding action is influenced by
   personal attitudes about the consciousness of art during observations of
   expressive body actions.}},

Title = {{Orbito-frontal lesions cause impairment during late but not early
   emotional prosodic processing}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{59-75}},
Abstract = {{The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is functionally linked to a variety of
   cognitive and emotional functions. In particular, lesions of the human
   OFC lead to large-scale changes in social and emotional behavior. For
   example, patients with OFC lesions are reported to suffer from deficits
   in affective decision-making, including impaired emotional face and
   voice expression recognition (e.g., Hornak et al., 1996, 2003). However,
   previous studies have failed to acknowledge that emotional processing is
   a multistage process. Thus, different stages of emotional processing
   (e.g., early vs. late) in the same patient group could be affected in a
   qualitatively different manner. The present study investigated this
   possibility and tested implicit emotional speech processing in an ERP
   experiment followed by an explicit behavioral emotional recognition
   task. OFC patients listened to vocal emotional expressions of anger,
   fear, disgust, and happiness compared to a neutral baseline spoken
   either with or without lexical content. In line with previous evidence
   (Paulmann Kotz, 2008b), both patients and healthy controls differentiate
   emotional and neutral prosody within 200 ms (P200). However, the
   recognition of emotional vocal expressions is impaired in OFC patients
   as compared to healthy controls. The current data serve as first
   evidence that emotional prosody processing is impaired only at a late,
   and not at an early processing stage in OFC patients.}},

Title = {{Neural regions that underlie reinforcement learning are also active for
   social expectancy violations}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{76-91}},
Abstract = {{Prediction error, the difference between an expected and an actual
   outcome, serves as a learning signal that interacts with reward and
   punishment value to direct future behavior during reinforcement
   learning. We hypothesized that similar learning and valuation signals
   may underlie social expectancy violations. Here, we explore the neural
   correlates of social expectancy violation signals along the universal
   person-perception dimensions trait warmth and competence. In this
   context, social learning may result from expectancy violations that
   occur when a target is inconsistent with an a priori schema. Expectancy
   violation may activate neural regions normally implicated in prediction
   error and valuation during appetitive and aversive conditioning. Using
   fMRI, we first gave perceivers high warmth or competence behavioral
   information that led to dispositional or situational attributions for
   the behavior. Participants then saw pictures of people responsible for
   the behavior; they represented social groups either inconsistent (rated
   low on either warmth or competence) or consistent (rated high on either
   warmth or competence) with the behavior information. Warmth and
   competence expectancy violations activate striatal regions that
   represent evaluative and prediction error signals. Social cognition
   regions underlie consistent expectations. These findings suggest that
   regions underlying reinforcement learning may work in concert with
   social cognition regions in warmth and competence social expectancy.
   This study illustrates the neural overlap between neuroeconomics and
   social neuroscience.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{92-104}},
Abstract = {{Recently, a standardized program for training of affect recognition
   (TAR) was developed which has demonstrated efficacy and specificity with
   respect to behavioral performance. The effects of the TAR on the
   cerebral correlates were evaluated using repeated fMRI event-related
   measurements in a group of schizophrenia patients (n=10) before and
   after TAR treatment six weeks apart. A second patient group without
   training (n=10, treatment as usual, TAU) as well as healthy subjects
   (n=10) were investigated at equivalent time points. Schizophrenia
   patients were shown to be differentially impaired in the identification
   of the emotional aspects of facial expressions (but not age
   discrimination) when compared with healthy participants. A specific
   improvement in the increased number of correct identifications was
   observed in trained patients only. In parallel, an increase in
   activation was noted in the left middle and superior occipital lobe, the
   right inferior and superior parietal cortex, and the inferior frontal
   cortex bilaterally in TAR patients compared to the TAU group. These
   activation changes in TAR patients correlated with their behavioral
   improvement, further corroborating the positive effect of training.
   Specific training effects are seen to correspond with cerebral effects,
   probably reflecting a more efficient use of attentional, perceptual, or
   cognitive strategies.}},

   semantic equivalences as precursors of parts of speech}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{105-117}},
Abstract = {{The anterior portion of the inferior parietal cortex possesses
   comprehensive representations of actions embedded in behavioural
   contexts. Mirror neurons, which respond to both self-executed and
   observed actions, exist in this brain region in addition to those
   originally found in the premotor cortex. We found that parietal mirror
   neurons responded differentially to identical actions embedded in
   different contexts. Another type of parietal mirror neuron represents an
   inverse and complementary property of responding equally to dissimilar
   actions made by itself and others for an identical purpose. Here, we
   propose a hypothesis that these sets of inferior parietal neurons
   constitute a neural basis for encoding the semantic equivalence of
   various actions across different agents and contexts. The neurons have
   mirror neuron properties, and they encoded generalization of agents,
   differentiation of outcomes, and categorization of actions that led to
   common functions. By integrating the activities of these mirror neurons
   with various codings, we further suggest that in the ancestral primates'
   brains, these various representations of meaningful action led to the
   gradual establishment of equivalence relations among the different types
   of actions, by sharing common action semantics. Such differential
   codings of the components of actions might represent precursors to the
   parts of protolanguage, such as gestural communication, which are shared
   among various members of a society. Finally, we suggest that the
   inferior parietal cortex serves as an interface between this action
   semantics system and other higher semantic systems, through common
   structures of action representation that mimic language syntax.}},

Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{118-128}},
Abstract = {{Despite evidence that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity is
   related to social exclusion, rejection and unfairness, evidence that
   medial frontal negativity (MFN), which has its source in the ACC,
   reflects these constructs remains unforthcoming. In the present study,
   subjects participated as recipients in an ultimatum game, while we
   recorded their electro-encephalogram (EEG). Participants responded to
   fair and unfair offers from different human proposers. In addition,
   participants rated themselves on a measure evaluating their concern for
   fairness. Results showed that MFN amplitude was more pronounced for
   unfair offers compared to fair offers. Moreover, this effect was shown
   to be most pronounced for subjects with high concerns for fairness. Our
   findings suggest that the MFN not only reflects whether outcomes match
   expectations, but also reflects whether the process by which these
   outcomes came about matches a social or even a moral norm. In addition,
   the present results suggest that people in bargaining situations are not
   only concerned with their own outcomes, but are also concerned with the
   fairness of the process that resulted in these outcomes.}},

   processing}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{133-147}},
Abstract = {{How we are viewed by other individualsour reputationhas a considerable
   influence on our everyday behaviors and is considered an important
   concept in explaining altruism, a uniquely human trait. Previously it
   has been proposed that processing one's own reputation requires a
   reputation representation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and a
   value representation in the striatum. Here, we directly tested this idea
   using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Subjects disclosed
   their behavioral tendencies with reference to social norms in the
   presence or absence of other people, a manipulation that is known to
   greatly affect an individual's concern for their reputation. The mPFC
   showed strong activation during self-referential processing, and this
   activity was enhanced by the mere presence of observers. Moreover, the
   striatum was also strongly activated when subjects responded in front of
   observers. Thus, the present study demonstrated that the mPFC and
   striatum were automatically recruited when the task placed a high demand
   on processing how one is viewed by others. Taken together, our findings
   suggest that the mPFC and the striatum play a key role in regulating
   human social behaviors, and these results provide valuable insight into

Title = {{My face in yours: Visuo-tactile facial stimulation influences sense of
   identity}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{148-162}},
Abstract = {{Self-face recognition is crucial for sense of identity and
   self-awareness. Finding self-face recognition disorders mainly in
   neurological and psychiatric diseases suggests that modifying sense of
   identity in a simple, rapid way remains a oholy grailo for cognitive
   neuroscience. By touching the face of subjects who were viewing
   simultaneous touches on a partner's face, we induced a novel illusion of
   personal identity that we call oenfacemento: The partner's facial
   features became incorporated into the representation of the
   participant's own face. Subjects reported that morphed images of
   themselves and their partner contained more self than other only after
   synchronous, but not asynchronous, stroking. Therefore, we modified
   self-face recognition by means of a simple psychophysical manipulation.
   While accommodating gradual change in one's own face is an important
   form of representational plasticity that may help maintaining identity
   over time, the surprisingly rapid changes induced by our procedure
   suggest that sense of facial identity may be more malleable than
   previously believed. oEnfacemento correlated positively with the
   participant's empathic traits and with the physical attractiveness the
   participants attributed to their partners. Thus, personality variables
   modulate enfacement, which may represent a marker of the tendency to be
   social and may be absent in subjects with defective empathy.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{163-170}},
Abstract = {{It has been recently demonstrated that pain behavior in the mouse can be
   modulated by the presence of a conspecific, but what remains unclear is
   whether such pain behavior can serve the function of soliciting social
   approach. Using a novel social approach paradigm, we tested mice in
   various dyadic or triadic conditions, including ojailedo micesome in
   pain via intraperitoneal injection of 0.9\% acetic acidand test mice
   free to approach or avoid the jailed mice. We observed a sex-specific
   effect whereby female, but not male, test mice approached a familiar
   same-sex conspecific in pain more frequently than an unaffected familiar
   or unfamiliar, but affected, conspecific. Despite a substantial
   literature emphasizing oxytocin's role in affiliative and pair-bonding
   behavior, this effect was also observed in female mice lacking the
   oxytocin receptor, suggesting that pain-related social approach may not
   be mediated by oxytocin. Furthermore, we found that the frequency of
   contact by the test mouse was negatively correlated with the pain
   behavior of the jailed mouse, suggesting that proximity of a familiar
   unaffected conspecific may have analgesic properties.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{5}},

Pages = {{171-186}},
Abstract = {{Eye contact is a highly salient and fundamentally social signal. This
   entails that the mere perception of direct gaze may trigger
   differentiated neurobehavioral responses as compared to other gaze
   directions. We investigated this issue using a visual word-spelling task
   where faces under different gaze directions and head orientations were
   displayed on-screen concomitantly with the words. We show evidence for
   automatic increase of skin conductance response (SCR), indicative of
   arousal, associated with the perception of direct gaze as compared to
   both averted gaze and closed eyes. Moreover, the perception of averted
   gaze was associated with an increase of electromyographic (EMG)
   corrugator activity. These effects were observed in two demanding
   word-spelling tasks, but not in a simple letter decision task. We
   propose to interpret these findings in terms of the social value of
   direct and averted gaze and conclude that some circumstances such as the
   task at hand may be essential for uncovering the neurobehavioral
   responses associated with the perception of others' gaze.}},

Title = {{Modulation of medial prefrontal and inferior parietal cortices when
   thinking about past, present, and future selves}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{187-200}},
Abstract = {{Recent functional neuroimaging studies have shown that reflecting on
   representations of the present self versus temporally distant selves is
   associated with higher activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC).
   In the current fMRI study, we investigated whether this effect of
   temporal perspective is symmetrical between the past and future. The
   main results revealed that the MPFC showed higher activity when
   reflecting on the present self than when reflecting on past and future
   selves, with no difference between past and future selves. Temporal
   perspective also modulated activity in the right inferior parietal
   cortex but in the opposite direction, activity in this brain region
   being higher when reflecting on past and future selves relative to the
   present self (with again no difference between past and future selves).
   These findings show that differences in brain activity when thinking
   about current versus temporally distant selves are symmetrical between
   the past and the future. It is suggested that by processing degrees of
   self-relatedness, the MPFC might sustain the process of identifying
   oneself with current representations of the self, whereas the right
   inferior parietal cortex might be involved in distinguishing the present
   self from temporally distant selves.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{201-220}},
Abstract = {{The decision to shoot a gun engages executive control processes that can
   be biased by cultural stereotypes and perceived threat. The neural locus
   of the decision to shoot is likely to be found in the anterior cingulate
   cortex (ACC), where cognition and affect converge. Male military cadets
   at Norwich University (N=37) performed a weapon identification task in
   which they made rapid decisions to shoot when images of guns appeared
   briefly on a computer screen. Reaction times, error rates, and
   electroencephalogram (EEG) activity were recorded. Cadets reacted more
   quickly and accurately when guns were primed by images of Middle-Eastern
   males wearing traditional clothing. However, cadets also made more false
   positive errors when tools were primed by these images. Error-related
   negativity (ERN) was measured for each response. Deeper ERNs were found
   in the medial-frontal cortex following false positive responses. Cadets
   who made fewer errors also produced deeper ERNs, indicating stronger
   executive control. Pupil size was used to measure autonomic arousal
   related to perceived threat. Images of Middle-Eastern males in
   traditional clothing produced larger pupil sizes. An image of Osama bin
   Laden induced the largest pupil size, as would be predicted for the
   exemplar of Middle East terrorism. Cadets who showed greater increases
   in pupil size also made more false positive errors. Regression analyses
   were performed to evaluate predictions based on current models of
   perceived threat, stereotype activation, and cognitive control. Measures
   of pupil size (perceived threat) and ERN (cognitive control) explained
   significant proportions of the variance in false positive errors to
   Middle-Eastern males in traditional clothing, while measures of reaction
   time, signal detection response bias, and stimulus discriminability
   explained most of the remaining variance.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{5}},

Pages = {{221-240}},
Abstract = {{Studies investigating the effects of violent computer and video game
   playing have resulted in heterogeneous outcomes. It has been assumed
   that there is a decreased ability to differentiate between virtuality
   and reality in people that play these games intensively. FMRI data of a
   group of young males with (gamers) and without (controls) a history of
   long-term violent computer game playing experience were obtained during
   the presentation of computer game and realistic video sequences. In
   gamers the processing of real violence in contrast to nonviolence
   produced activation clusters in right inferior frontal, left lingual and
   superior temporal brain regions. Virtual violence activated a network
   comprising bilateral inferior frontal, occipital, postcentral, right
   middle temporal, and left fusiform regions. Control participants showed
   extended left frontal, insula and superior frontal activations during
   the processing of real, and posterior activations during the processing
   of virtual violent scenarios. The data suggest that the ability to
   differentiate automatically between real and virtual violence has not
   been diminished by a long-term history of violent video game play, nor
   have gamers' neural responses to real violence in particular been
   subject to desensitization processes. However, analyses of individual
   data indicated that group-related analyses reflect only a small part of
   actual individual different neural network involvement, suggesting that
   the consideration of individual learning history is sufficient for the
   present discussion.}},

Title = {{Facial mimicry is not necessary to recognize emotion: Facial expression
   recognition by people with Moebius syndrome}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{241-251}},
Abstract = {{According to the reverse simulation model of embodied simulation theory,
   we recognize others' emotions by subtly mimicking their expressions,
   which allows us to feel the corresponding emotion through facial
   feedback. Previous studies examining whether facial mimicry is necessary
   for facial expression recognition were limited by potentially
   distracting manipulations intended to artificially restrict facial
   mimicry or very small samples of people with facial paralysis. We
   addressed these limitations by collecting the largest sample to date of
   people with Moebius syndrome, a condition characterized by congenital
   bilateral facial paralysis. In this Internet-based study, 37 adults with
   Moebius syndrome and 37 matched control participants completed a facial
   expression recognition task. People with Moebius syndrome did not differ

Title = {{Differential dorsal and ventral medial prefrontal representations of the
   implicit self modulated by individualism and collectivism: An fMRI study}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{257-271}},
Abstract = {{Individualism and collectivism, or self-construal style, refer to
   cultural values that influence how people think about themselves and
   their relation to the social and physical environment. Recent
   neuroimaging evidence suggests that cultural values of individualism and
   collectivism dynamically modulate neural response within cortical
   midline structures, such as the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and
   posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), during explicit self-evaluation.
   However, it remains unknown whether cultural priming modulates neural
   response during self-evaluation due to explicit task demands. Here we
   investigated how cultural priming of self-construal style affects neural
   activity within cortical midline structures during implicit
   self-evaluation in bicultural individuals. Results indicate that ventral
   MPFC showed relatively less deactivation during implicit evaluation of
   both self- and father-relevant information as compared to control
   condition (e.g., information of an unfamiliar person), irrespective of
   cultural priming. By contrast, dorsal MPFC showed relatively less
   deactivation during implicit evaluation of father-relevant information,
   but not self-relevant information, as compared to control condition,
   only when they were primed with individualism. Furthermore, dorsal MPFC
   showed relatively less deactivation during implicit evaluation of
   father-relevant information as compared to self-relevant condition only
   when they were primed with individualism. Hence, our results indicate
   that cultural priming modulates neural response within dorsal, but not
   ventral, portions of MPFC in a stimulus-driven rather than task-driven
   manner. More broadly, these findings suggest that cultural values
   dynamically shape neural representations during the evaluation, rather
   than the detection, of self-relevant information.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{272-284}},
Abstract = {{Putative contributions of a human mirror neuron system (hMNS) to the
   perception of social information have been assessed by measuring the
   suppression of EEG oscillations in the mu/alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (15-25
   Hz) and low-gamma (25-25 Hz) ranges while participants processed social
   information revealed by point-light displays of human motion. Identical
   dynamic displays were presented and participants were instructed to
   distinguish the intention, the emotion, or the gender of a moving image
   of a person, while they performed an adapted odd-ball task. Relative to
   a baseline presenting a nonbiological but meaningful motion display, all
   three biological motion conditions reduced the EEG amplitude in the
   mu/alpha and beta ranges, but not in the low-gamma range. Suppression
   was larger in the intention than in the emotion and gender conditions,
   with no difference between the latter two. Moreover, the suppression in
   the intention condition was negatively correlated with an accepted
   measure of empathy (EQ), revealing that participants high in empathy
   scores manifested less suppression. For intention and emotion the
   suppression was larger at occipital than at central sites, suggesting
   that factors other than motor system were in play while processing
   social information embedded in the motion of point-light displays.}},

   cues: A study of lateralized ERPs}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{285-295}},
Abstract = {{This study investigated the electrophysiological (event-related
   potential, ERP) and behavioral (reaction time, RT) correlates of
   gaze-cued shifts of visuospatial attention. Participants viewed
   centrally presented faces with neutral expressions in which eyes looked
   straight ahead and then shifted to the left or right. Upon movement of
   the eyes, the facial expression either stayed the same (neutral) or
   changed to a fearful or happy expression. Participants' task was to
   identify a probe letter (T or L), which appeared in either the same or
   the opposite location to the direction of the eye gaze. There was
   behavioral evidence of a gaze congruency effect, as RTs were faster when
   the eyes looked toward rather than away from the location of the target.
   The ERP data indicated the presence of a significant gaze-congruent
   anterior directing attention negativity (ADAN) at anterior locations
   (300-500 ms after the onset of the gaze cue). ERP data did not show
   evidence of initial orienting of attention triggered by gaze cues in the
   early directing attention negativity (EDAN) at posterior locations
   (200-300 ms post-cue onset). The gaze cueing effects in the RT and ERP
   data were not significantly influenced by the emotional expression of
   the faces. The presence of the ADAN may reflect neural mechanisms that
   underlie the holding of attention on gazed-at locations.}},

Title = {{Social cognition in individuals with agenesis of the corpus callosum}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{296-308}},
Abstract = {{Past research has revealed that individuals with agenesis of the corpus
   callosum (ACC) have deficits in interhemispheric transfer, complex novel
   problem-solving, and the comprehension of paralinguistic aspects of
   language. Case studies and family reports also suggest problems in
   social cognition. The performance of 11 individuals with complete ACC
   and with normal intelligence was compared to that of 13 IQ- and
   age-matched controls on three measures of social cognition. Individuals
   with ACC were indistinguishable from controls on the Happe Theory of
   Mind Stories and the Adult Faux Pas Test, but performed significantly
   worse on various portions of the Thames Awareness of Social Inference
   Test (TASIT) involving interpretations of videotaped social vignettes.
   Further analysis of the TASIT indicated that individuals with ACC showed
   deficiency in the recognition of emotion, weakness in understanding
   paradoxical sarcasm, and particular difficulty interpreting textual
   versus visual social cues. These results suggest that the tendency for
   deficient social cognition in individuals with ACC stems from a
   combination of difficulty integrating information from multiple sources,
   using paralinguistic cues for emotion, and understanding nonliteral
   speech. Together, these deficits would contribute to a less robust
   theory of mind.}},

Title = {{Logic in an asymmetrical (social) brain: Transitive inference in the
   young domestic chick}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{309-319}},
Abstract = {{The ability of animals to perform transitive inference is associated
   with social group formation and dominance hierarchies. Brain
   lateralization is also linked to the selective pressures associated with
   social life. We investigated whether transitive inference is better
   performed by lateralized than non-lateralized brains. In the domestic
   chick (Gallus gallus) exposure of eggs to light before hatching leads to
   the development of lateralization of some visual functions. Thus, it is
   possible to obtain chicks with strong (light-incubated, Li-chicks) or
   weak (dark-incubated, Di-chicks) lateralization. Di- and Li-chicks were
   trained to discriminate stimulus pairs, in order to build a hierarchy (A
   B C D E). Chicks were subsequently tested on stimulus pairs never seen
   together before (AE and BD). Li-chicks performed the discrimination BD
   better than did Di-chicks, suggesting that exposure to light in the egg
   leads to an increased ability to carry out representational learning.
   Moreover, lateralized chicks using their left eye only (right
   hemisphere) during test showed a better performance than did right eye
   only (left hemisphere) chicks on the BD task. Females also tended to
   perform better than males. Results demonstrate that chicks with
   lateralized brain hemispheres show greater inference, and this is under
   right hemisphere control: the brain hemisphere that is dominant in
   social interactions.}},

Title = {{Neural activation in the oreward circuito shows a nonlinear response to
   facial attractiveness}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{320-334}},
Abstract = {{Positive behavioral responses to attractive faces have led
   neuroscientists to investigate underlying neural mechanisms in a oreward
   circuito that includes brain regions innervated by dopamine pathways.
   Using male faces ranging from attractive to extremely unattractive,
   disfigured ones, this study is the first to demonstrate heightened
   responses to both rewarding and aversive faces in numerous areas of this
   putative reward circuit. Parametric analyses employing orthogonal linear
   and nonlinear regressors revealed positive nonlinear effects in anterior
   cingulate cortex, lateral orbital frontal cortex (LOFC), striatum
   (nucleus accumbens, caudate, putamen), and ventral tegmental area, in
   addition to replicating previously documented linear effects in medial
   orbital frontal cortex (MOFC) and LOFC and nonlinear effects in amygdala
   and MOFC. The widespread nonlinear responses are consistent with single
   cell recordings in animals showing responses to both rewarding and
   aversive stimuli, and with some human fMRI investigations of non-face
   stimuli. They indicate that the reward circuit does not process face
   valence with any simple dissociation of function across structures.
   Perceiver gender modulated some responses to our male faces: Women
   showed stronger linear effects, and men showed stronger nonlinear
   effects, which may have functional implications. Our discovery of
   nonlinear responses to attractiveness throughout the reward circuit
   echoes the history of amygdala research: Early work indicated a linear
   response to threatening stimuli, including faces; later work also
   revealed a nonlinear response with heightened activation to affectively
   salient stimuli regardless of valence. The challenge remains to
   determine how such dual coding influences feelings, such as pleasure and
   pain, and guides goal-related behavioral responses, such as approach and
   avoidance.}},

Abstract = {{In everyday life causal attribution is important in order to structure
   the complex world, provide explanations for events and to understand why
   our environment interacts with us in a particular way. This study used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 30 healthy subjects to
   separate the neural correlates of self vs. external responsibility for
   social events and explore the neural basis of self-serving attributions
   (internal attributions of positive events and external attributions of
   negative events). We presented short sentences describing positive and
   negative social events and asked participants to imagine the event, to
   decide the main cause and assign it to one of the categories (internal
   vs. external). FMRI data were analyzed using a 2 x 2 factorial design
   with the factors emotional valence and attribution. Internal compared to
   external attribution revealed activations along the right
   temporoparietal junction (TPJ). The reverse contrast showed a left
   lateralized network mainly involving the TPJ, the precuneus and the
   superior/medial frontal gyrus. These results confirmed the involvement
   of a fronto-temporoparietal network in differentiating self and external
   responsibility. Analysis of the self-serving bias yielded activation in
   the dorsal anterior cingulate and in the dorsal striatum, suggesting a
   rewarding value of these attributions.}},

Pages = {{351-359}},
Abstract = {{Faces are a developmentally primary and critically important source of
   social information, and they are processed differently from most other
   visual percepts. Studies of brain electrophysiology reveal a
   face-sensitive component, the N170, which is typically enhanced to faces
   relative to other stimuli. Research in social disabilities suggests that
   an atypical N170 response in this population may stem from decreased
   developmental exposure to faces secondary to reduced social interest.
   Here we examined the relationship between neural responses to faces and
   social personality characteristics in a normative sample. Participants
   were pre-screened to identify individuals scoring high on extraversion
   or introversion. Both groups were presented with upright and inverted
   face stimuli. An inversion effect, a marker of expertise for faces, was
   observed in people with high extraversion but not in those with high
   introversion. These findings suggest that, within typically developing
   populations, social attitudes are reflected in the neural correlates of
   face perception.}},

Title = {{When your errors make me lose or win: Event-related potentials to
   observed errors of cooperators and competitors}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{360-374}},
Abstract = {{Monitoring one's own errors is a fundamental ability in terms of guiding
   and improving behavior, with specific neural substrates in the anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC). Similarly, we can monitor others' actions and
   learn by observing their errors. The mirror neuron system may subserve
   the formation of shared representations for self-generated and observed
   actions, and recent research suggests that monitoring mechanisms also
   react to errors made by others. However, it remains unknown how these
   responses are modified when interpersonal context implies different
   goals for the actor and the observer. To investigate whether differences
   in social context can influence brain response to observed action
   errors, we manipulated competition vs. cooperation between two
   participants taking turns in a go/no-go task. Event-related potentials
   simultaneously recorded from both participants showed a typical
   negativity over frontocentral regions to self-generated errors,
   irrespective of interpersonal context, but early differential responses
   to other-generated errors only during cooperation, with sources in
   precuneus and medial premotor areas. Competition produced a distinct
   error-related negativity in ACC at later latencies. We conclude that
   error monitoring for others' actions depends on their congruence with
   personal goals, and recruits brain systems involved in self-referential
   processing specifically during cooperation.}},

Abstract = {{Social behavior and desire for social relationships have been
   independently linked to the serotonergic system, the prefrontal cortex,
   especially the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and the anterior cingulate
   cortex (ACC). The goal of this study was to explore the role of
   serotonin 5HT2A receptors in these brain regions in forming and
   maintaining close interpersonal relationships. Twenty-four healthy
   subjects completed the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) prior
   to undergoing {[}18F]setoperone brain positron emission tomography (PET)
   to measure serotonin 5HT2A receptor availability within the OFC (BA 11
   and 47) and ACC (BA 32). We explored the relationship between desire for
   social relationships, as measured by the TCI reward dependence (RD)
   scale, and 5HT2A receptor non-displaceable binding potential (BPnd) in
   these regions. Scores of RD were negatively correlated with 5HT2A BPnd
   in the ACC (BA 32, r = -.528, p = .012) and OFC (BA 11, r = -.489, p =
   .021; BA 47, r = -.501, p = .017). These correlations were corroborated
   by a voxel-wise analysis. These results suggest that the serotonergic
   system may have a regulatory effect on the OFC and ACC for establishing
   and maintaining social relationships.}},

   to not being imitated activates brain areas that have been associated
   with emotion and reward processing, namely medial orbitofrontal
   cortex/ventromedial prefrontal cortex (mOFC/vmPFC, GLM whole-brain

Title = {{From facial mimicry to emotional empathy: A role for norepinephrine ?}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{393-400}},
Abstract = {{Tendency to mimic others' emotional facial expressions predicts empathy
   and may represent a physiological marker of psychopathy. Anatomical
   connectivity between amygdala, cingulate motor cortex (M3, M4), and
   facial nucleus demonstrates a potential neuroanatomical substrate for
   mimicry, though pharmacological influences are largely unknown.
   Norepinephrine modulation selectively impairs negative emotion
   recognition, reflecting a potential role in processing empathy-eliciting
   facial expressions. We examined effects of single doses of propranolol
   (beta-adrenoceptor blocker) and reboxetine (selective norepinephrine
   reuptake inhibitor) on automatic facial mimicry of sadness, anger, and
   happiness, and the relationship between mimicry and empathy. Forty-five
   healthy volunteers were randomized to 40 mg propranolol or 4 mg
   reboxetine. Two hours after drug subjects viewed and rated facial
   expressions of sadness, anger, and happiness, while corrugator,
   zygomatic, and mentalis EMG were recorded. Trait emotional empathy was
   measured using the Balanced Emotional Empathy Scale. EMG confirmed
   emotion-specific mimicry and the relationship between corrugator mimicry
   and empathy. Norepinephrine modulation did not alter mimicry to any
   expression or influence the relationship between mimicry and empathy.
   Corrugator but not zygomaticus mimicry predicts trait empathy,
   consistent with greater anatomical connectivity between amygdala and M3
   coding upper facial muscle representations. Although influencing emotion
   perception, norepinephrine does not influence emotional facial mimicry
   or its relationship with trait empathy.}},

   lesions}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{401-416}},
Abstract = {{Perception and execution of actions share a common representational and
   neural substrate and thereby facilitate unintentional motor mimicry.
   Controlling automatic imitation is therefore a crucial requirement of
   such a oshared representationalo system. Based on previous findings from
   neuroimaging, we suggest that resisting motor mimicry recruits the same
   underlying computational mechanisms also involved in higher-level social
   cognitive processing, such as self - other differentiation and the
   representation of mental states. The aim of the present study was to
   investigate on a behavioral level whether there is a functional
   association between the inhibition of imitation and tasks, assessing the
   understanding of mental states and of different perspectives of self and
   other. In a sample of neuropsychological patients with frontal lesions,
   a correlation between the ability for mental state attribution and the
   control of imitation was found, with a similar effect in the control
   group. Temporo-parietal lesioned patients showed a highly significant
   correlation between imitative control and visual and cognitive
   perspective-taking. Even after controlling for executive functions, the
   results remained significant, indicating the functional specificity of
   this relationship. These findings provide new insight into the
   functional processes underlying the control of shared representations
   and suggest a novel link between embodied and higher-level social
   cognition.}},

Abstract = {{Fully-fledged affective systems in mature animals are in part the result
   of the impact of infantile experience on brain development. The present
   experimental series examines whether tactile stimulation in infancy
   (early handling) influences rough-and-tumble play (RT) throughout the
   juvenile period, using a testing regime of 17 days divided into five
   parts where handled (H) and nonhandled (NH) Wistar rats are assessed
   daily. In Parts 1 and 2 (age range at the start: 30-33 days) the
   objective is to study the amount of RT that the rats are capable of
   exhibiting under varying lengths of social deprivation. In Part 3 (37-40
   days) the objective is to determine whether familiarity with the
   experimental situation has independent or interactive effects with early
   handling. In Part 4 (40-43 days) the objective is to obtain evidence of
   the suppressing effects of an unexpected contextual change. In Part 5
   (56-59 days) the objective is to study whether the effects of early
   handling can still be present at an age when RT has practically vanished
   in NH rats. Results show that early handling invigorates RT affecting
   pins (i.e., the most rewarding component) at the expense of dorsal
   contacts by enhancing play motivation in a specific manner, and that it
   is able to dilate the inverted-U developmental curve of this behavior,
   thereby providing strong evidence for a direct effect on the
   neuropsychological systems for play motivation.}},

Title = {{Motor activation during observation of unusual versus ordinary actions
   in infancy}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{5-6}},
Pages = {{451-460}},
Abstract = {{Infants make predictions about actions they observe already during the
   first year of life. To investigate the role of the motor system in
   predicting the end state of observed actions, 12-month-old infants were
   shown movies of ordinary and extraordinary object-directed actions. The
   stimuli displayed a female actor who picked up an everyday object (a cup
   or a phone) and brought it to either her mouth or her ear. In this way,
   a similar movement could be ordinary (e.g., cup to mouth) or
   extraordinary (e.g., phone to mouth) depending on the object used.
   Infants' EEG and eye movements were recorded. We found a significantly
   stronger motor activation, indicated by a stronger desynchronization in
   the mu-frequency band over fronto-central areas, during observation of
   extraordinary compared to ordinary actions. This is explained within the
   computational framework of Kilner, Friston, and Frith (2007), who
   suggest that the motor system is used to generate predictions about
   actions we observe. If the observed action deviates from the initially
   expected path, additional predictions have to be generated, resulting in
   a stronger motor activation during perception of extraordinary actions.
   In sum, it appears that from early in life, the motor system is involved
   in making predictions about how an observed action will end.}},

Abstract = {{Social acceptance is of key importance for healthy functioning. We used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine age-related

   pre-pubertal children (8-10 years), early adolescents (12-14 years),
   older adolescents (16-17 years) and young adults (19-25 years). During
   the experiment, participants were presented with unfamiliar faces of
   peers and were asked to predict whether they expected to be liked or
   disliked by the other person, followed by feedback indicating acceptance
   or rejection. Results showed that activation in the ventral mPFC and
   striatum to social feedback was context-dependent; there was increased
   activation when participants had positive expectations about social
   evaluation, and increased activation following social acceptance
   feedback. Age-related comparisons revealed a linear increase in activity
   with age in these brain regions for positive expectations of social
   evaluation. Similarly, a linear increase with age was found for
   activation in the striatum, ventral mPFC, OFC, and lateral PFC for
   rejection feedback. No age-related differences in neural activation were
   shown for social acceptance feedback. Together, these results provide
   important insights in the developmental trajectories of brain regions
   implicated in social and affective behavior.}},

   activity, and ostracism distress}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{5-6}},
Pages = {{483-495}},
Abstract = {{This study examined neural activity with event-related potentials (ERPs)
   in middle childhood during a computer-simulated ball-toss game,
   Cyberball. After experiencing fair play initially, children were
   ultimately excluded by the other players. We focused specifically on
   onot my turno events within fair play and rejection events within social
   exclusion. Dense-array ERPs revealed that rejection events are perceived
   rapidly. Condition differences (onot my turno vs. rejection) were
   evident in a posterior ERP peaking at 420 ms consistent, with a larger
   P3 effect for rejection events indicating that in middle childhood
   rejection events are differentiated in 500 ms. Condition differences
   were evident for slow-wave activity (500-900 ms) in the medial frontal
   cortical region and the posterior occipital-parietal region, with
   rejection events more negative frontally and more positive posteriorly.
   Distress from the rejection experience was associated with a more
   negative frontal slow wave and a larger late positive slow wave, but
   only for rejection events. Source modeling with Geosouce software
   suggested that slow-wave neural activity in cortical regions previously
   identified in functional imaging studies of ostracism, including
   subgenual cortex, ventral anterior cingulate cortex, and insula, was
   greater for rejection events vs. onot my turno events.}},

Title = {{Witnessing peer rejection during early adolescence: Neural correlates of
   empathy for experiences of social exclusion}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{5-6}},
Pages = {{496-507}},
Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies with adults have begun to reveal the neural bases
   of empathy; however, this research has focused on empathy for physical
   pain, rather than empathy for negative social experiences. Moreover,
   this work has not examined adolescents who may frequently witness and
   empathize with others that experience negative social experiences such
   as peer rejection. Here, we examined neural activity among early
   adolescents observing social exclusion compared to observing inclusion,
   and how this activity related to both trait empathy and subsequent
   prosocial behavior. Participants were scanned while they observed an
   individual whom they believed was being socially excluded. At least one
   day prior to the scan they reported their trait empathy, and following
   the scan they wrote emails to the excluded victim that were rated for
   prosocial behavior (e.g., helping, comforting). Observing exclusion
   compared to inclusion activated regions involved in mentalizing (i.e.,
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex), particularly among highly empathic
   individuals. Additionally, individuals who displayed more activity in
   affective, pain-related regions during observed exclusion compared to
   inclusion subsequently wrote more prosocial emails to excluded victims.
   Overall findings suggest that when early adolescents witness social
   exclusion in their daily lives, some may actually `feel the pain' of the
   victims and act more prosocially toward them as a result.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{5-6}},
Pages = {{508-518}},
Abstract = {{Family assistance is an important aspect of family relationships for
   adolescents across many cultures and contexts. Motivations to help
   family members may be driven by both cultural factors and early family
   experiences. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to
   examine (1) cultural differences in neural reward activity among White
   and Latino youth during online experiences of family assistance and (2)
   how prior family experiences related to neural reward activity when
   helping the family. Participants were scanned as they made decisions to
   contribute money to their family and themselves. Latino and White
   participants showed similar behavioral levels of helping but distinct
   patterns of neural activity within the mesolimbic reward system. Whereas
   Latino participants showed more reward activity when contributing to
   their family, White participants showed more reward activity when
   gaining cash for themselves. In addition, participants who felt more
   identified with their family and who derived greater fulfillment from
   helping their family two years prior to the scan showed increased reward
   system activation when contributing to their family. These results
   suggest that family assistance may be guided, in part, by the personal
   rewards one attains from that assistance, and that this sense of reward
   may be modulated by cultural influences and prior family experiences.}},

   adolescent girls}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{5-6}},
Pages = {{519-532}},
Abstract = {{Relational aggression is a type of aggression that aims to hurt others
   through relationships and includes behaviors such as gossip and
   ostracism. This type of aggression is very common among adolescent
   girls, and in its more intense forms has been linked with poor
   psychosocial outcomes, including depression and suicide. In the present
   study we investigated whether individual differences in sensitivity to
   relational aggression among adolescent girls predicted recruitment of
   neural networks associated with executive function and cognitive
   control. Neural response was measured using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging during an affect recognition task that included
   unfamiliar peer faces. A finding of relatively fewer reports of being
   victimized by relational aggression was associated with increased
   recruitment of bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortices as well as
   anterior and posterior cingulate cortices in response to the affect
   recognition task, as well as with greater competence on behavioral
   measures of executive function. Our results suggest that girls who are
   able to recruit specific frontal networks to improve cognitive and
   executive control are less sensitive to relational aggression.}},

Abstract = {{Emotion regulation is a critical aspect of children's social
   development, yet few studies have examined the brain mechanisms involved
   in its development. Theoretical accounts have conceptualized emotion
   regulation as relying on prefrontal control of limbic regions,
   specifying the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as a key brain region.
   Functional magnetic resonance imaging in 5- to 11-year-olds during
   emotion regulation and processing of emotionally expressive faces
   revealed that older children preferentially recruited the more dorsal
   ocognitiveo areas of the ACC, while younger children preferentially
   engaged the more ventral oemotionalo areas. Additionally, children with
   more fearful temperaments exhibited more ventral ACC activity while less
   fearful children exhibited increased activity in the dorsal ACC. These
   findings provide insight into a potential neurobiological mechanism
   underlying well-documented behavioral and cognitive changes from more
   emotional to more cognitive regulatory strategies with increasing age,
   as well as individual differences in this developmental process as a
   function of temperament. Our results hold important implications for our
   understanding of normal development and should also help to inform our
   understanding and management of emotional disorders.}},

Abstract = {{The recognition of emotional expressions is an important skill and
   relates to social functioning and adjustment in childhood. The current
   functional MRI study investigated the neural processing of angry and
   happy facial expressions in 5- to 6-year-old children and in adults.
   Participants were presented happy and angry faces of adults and children
   while they performed a non-emotion-related task with low cognitive load.
   Very similar neural networks were involved in the processing of angry
   and happy faces in adults and children, including the amygdala and
   prefrontal areas. In general, children showed heightened amygdala
   activation in response to emotional faces relative to adults. While
   children showed stronger amygdala activation in response to angry adult
   compared to angry child faces, adults showed stronger amygdala
   activation for angry child faces. In both age groups enhanced amygdala
   involvement was found for happy peer faces relative to happy non-peer
   faces, though this effect was only a tendency in adults. The findings
   are discussed in the context of the development of the social brain

   cortex on a visual search task}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{5-6}},
Pages = {{560-576}},
Abstract = {{Previous behavioral research has revealed a positivity effect that
   occurs with aging, with older adults focusing more on positive
   information and less on negative emotional stimuli as compared to young
   adults. Questions have been raised as to whether this effect exists in
   the rapid detection of information or whether it operates only at later
   stages of processing. In the present study, we used eye-tracking and
   neuroimaging methodologies to examine whether the two age groups
   accomplished the detection of emotional information on a visual search
   task using the same mechanisms. Eye-tracking results revealed no
   significant age differences in detection or viewing time of emotional
   targets as a function of valence. Despite their general similarity in
   task performance, neuroimaging results revealed an age-related
   valence-based reversal in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) activity, with
   detection of negative compared to positive targets activating the MPFC
   more for younger adults, and detection of positive compared to negative
   targets activating the MPFC more for older adults. These results suggest
   that age-related valence reversals in neural activity can exist even on
   tasks that require only relatively automatic processing of emotional
   information.}},

Abstract = {{Although decorticated rats are able to engage in play. their play is

   decorticates do not modify their defensive tactics in response to the
   social identity of their partners. Third. decorticates; display a global
   shift in defensive tactics from more complex to less complex strategies.
   It has been shown that lesions of the motor cortex (MC) selectively
   produce the abnormal developmental effects oil play. and that lesions of
   the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) selectively produce the deficits in
   behavioral discrimination between social partners In the Current set of
   experiments, we demonstrate that lesions of the medial prefrontal cortex
   (mPFC) produce the shift from more complex to less complex defensive
   tactics. while leaving intact the age-related and partner-related
   modulation of defensive strategies. Thus, we have evidence for a triple
   dissociation of function between the MC, the OFC. and the mPFC with

Abstract = {{Early life experience impacts emotional development in the infant. In
   rat pups, repeated, brief (ie, 15 min) maternal separation (MS 15)
   during the first 1-2 postnatal weeks has been shown to increase active
   maternal care and to reduce later anxiety-like behavior in the
   offspring. We hypothesized that the anxiolytic effect of MS15 is partly
   due to increased intestinal release of cholecystokinin (CCK) in rat pups
   as a result of increased maternal contact. We predicted that rats with a
   history of MS15 would display less anxiety in the elevated plus maze
   (EPMZ) and novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) tests. as compared with
   nonseparated (NS) controls, and that the anxiolytic effect of MS15 would
   be attenuated in rats in which daily MS15 was accompanied by systemic
   administration of a CCK-1 receptor antagonist (i.e, devazepide)
   Treatment groups included NS control litters, litters exposed to MS15
   from postnatal days (P)1-10. inclusive, and litters exposed to MS15 with
   concurrent subcutaneous injection of devazepide or vehicle Litters were
   undisturbed after P10 and were weaned on P21. Subsets of adolescent
   males from each litter were tested in the EPMZ on P40-41, while others
   were tested for NSF on P50-52 As predicted, rats with a developmental
   history of MS15 displayed reduced anxiety-like behavior in the EPMZ and
   NSF tests. The anxiolytic effect of MS15 was preserved in
   vehicle-treated rats, bill was reversed in devazepide-treated rats.
   These results support the view that endogenous CCK-1 receptor signaling
   in infants is a potential pathway through which maternal-pup
   interactions regulate the development and functional organization of
   emotional circuits that control anxiety-like behavior in the offspring.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between the prefrontal cortex and amygdala are thought to

   that lead to an inability to wait for rewards or a diminished capacity

   and decreased compulsivity through flexibility However. both
   self-control and flexibility appear to involve the amygdala. Using a
   delay discounting paradigm. the current investigation found that
   inactivation and disconnection of the medial prefrontal cortex and
   basolateral amygdala led rats to become more impulsive by affecting
   preference for smaller immediate over larger delayed rewards.
   Conversely. inactivation and disconnection of the orbitofrontal cortex
   and amygdala led rats to become more compulsive as demonstrated by an
   inability to flexibly reverse stimulus-reward relationships in an odor
   reversal task The current findings support a double dissociation between
   orbitofrontal cortex-amygdala interactions for odor reversal and medial

Abstract = {{We have demonstrated in our previous studies that ventral subicular
   lesion induces neurodegeneration of the hippocampus and produces
   cognitive impairment in rats; In die present study, the efficacy of
   transplanted green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled hippocampal cell
   line (H3-GFP) cells in establishing functional recovery in ventral
   subicular lesioned rats has been evaluated. The survival of H3-GFP
   transplants and their ability to express trophic factors in vivo were
   also Investigated Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to selective
   lesioning of ventral subiculum and were transplanted with H3-GFP cells
   into die cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) hippocampus. The transplants sealed
   mainly in the dentate gyrus and expressed neurotrophic factors.
   brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and basic fibroblast growth
   factor (bFGF) The ventral subicular lesioned (VSL) Rats with H3-GFP
   transplants showed enhanced expression of BDNF in the hippocampus and
   performed well in eight-arm radial maze and Moms water maze The VSL rats
   without hippocampal transplants continued to show cognitive impairments
   In task learning. The present study demonstrated the H3-GFP transplants
   mediated recovery of cognitive functions in VSL, rats. Our study
   supports the notion of graft meditated host regeneration and functional
   recovery through trophic support. although these mechanisms require
   further investigation}},

   demonstrated that female rats expressed a reduction in post-pairing

   produced anorexia. it did not elicit post-pairing reductions in sucrose
   consumption Experiment 3 revealed that contingent pairing was a
   requirement for post-pairing reduction in sucrose consumption even when
   testing was done at a time when anorexia is expressed. These finding,
   demonstrate the dissociability of the conditioning and anorectic effects

Abstract = {{Introduction: Caffeine is frequently consumed concurrent to or

   ethanol interact to modulate behavior is essential to understanding the
   co-use of these drugs The plus-maze discriminative avoidance task
   (PMDAT) allows within-subject measurement of learning, anxiety, and
   locomotion Methods: For training, each mouse wits placed in the center
   of the plus-maze for 5 min. and each time that the mouse entered the
   aversive enclosed arm, a light and white noise were turned oil At
   testing, each mouse wits returned to the center of the maze for 3 min No
   cues were turned on during testing Results: Ethanol (1 0-1 4 g/kg)
   dose-dependently decreased anxiety and learning, and increased
   locomotion Caffeine (5 0-40 0 mg/kg) dose-dependently increased anxiety
   and decreased locomotion and learning Caffeine failed to reverse
   ethanol-induced learning deficits However, 1 4 g/kg ethanol blocked the
   anxiogenic effect of caffeine Discussion: Although caffeine and ethanol
   interact to modulate behavior in the PMDAT. caffeine does not reverse
   ethanol-induced learning, deficits Ethanol-induced anxiolysis may
   contribute to alcohol consumption. while ethanol's blockade of
   Caffeine-induced anxiogenesis may contribute to co-use.}},

   produced similar levels of overall locomotor suppression, only the D2
   antagonist increased the duration of time that animals heads remained in
   the food compartment during both Pavlovian and operant task performance.
   In contrast. D1 antagonist SCH23390 decreased the proportion of trials
   in which animals executed both the Pavlovian approach and operant
   lever-press. while raclopride did not. The. results suggest that D2
   receptor blockade preferentially increases response duration. and, under
   the simple discrete-trial procedures employed here. D1 receptor blockade
   preferential reduces Pavlovian and operant response likelihood}},

Abstract = {{Genetic variation of the serotonin transporter (SCL6A4, 5-HTT) has been
   associated with fear- and anxiety-related behaviors. while a
   polymorphism in exon III of the D4 dopamine receptor gene (DRD4) has
   been linked to novelty seeking. The dopaminergic and the serotonergic
   neurotransmitter system have been found to modulate the
   amygdala-connected circuitries that are crucial in emotional modulation
   and response to fearful stimuli Additionally, reactivity of
   amygdala-innervated effector systems is also essential for our
   under-standing of anxiety-related behaviors Here, we used the
   stress-induced activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to
   investigate the impact of 5-HTTLPR and DRD4 on the cortisol stress
   response in 84 healthy adults. Saliva cortisol was measured during and
   after the Trier Social Stress Test We found a significant main effect of
   DRD4 Carriers of the 7R allele exhibited lower cortisol responses.
   Additionally, a DRD4 by 5-HTTLPR interaction emerged 5-HTTLPR L-A/L-A
   homozygotes showed a lower cortisol response than did S or L-G allele
   carriers but only if they possessed at least one copy of the DRD4 7R
   allele. The results point to independent and joint effects or these
   polymorphisms on stress responsivity.}},

Abstract = {{As one of the most studied protein hormones, insulin as Well as its

   biological processes Detection Of Insulin and its receptor in the
   central nervous system (CNS) has led to a rapidly growing interest in
   the central effects of insulin Insulin and its receptor are located in
   the specific area of the CNS with a diversity of region-specific
   functions different from its direct carbohydrate homeostasis in file
   periphery. The high density of insulin/insulin receptor in brain areas
   such a, the hippocampus and cerebral cortex have shown to play an
   important role in higher cognitive functions. suggesting that insulin
   might be involved ill the Modulation of memory Previous studies have
   offered controversial results regarding the effects of insulin On
   various types of memory The aim of the present study is to determine
   whether intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of insulin improves
   the water maze performance of rats. The experimental groups had
   pretraining insulin infusion (2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 mu) into the third

   Insulin treatment Caused all enhancing effect on spatial memory in a

   significant effect on the water maze achievement of rills. whereas
   higher doses (16 and 32 mu) significantly improved the rats' performance
   These results suggest that ICV administration of insulin may result in I

   behavioral tasks that emphasize spatial information processing The
   results demonstrate that at 12 and 24 weeks of age. CGG KI mice were
   unable to detect a change in the distance between two objects (metric

Abstract = {{The Ventral tegmental area (VTA) plays a critical role in motivated
   behavior However. it remains unclear whether Intact VTA function Is
   necessary for motivated behavior to seek contexts repeatedly paired with
   natural stimuli and/or pharmacological Stimuli In the present Study.
   conditioned place preference (CPP) was induced with highly salient
   natural or drug stimuli attributed with strong incentive-motivational
   Value in each of 2 female models Postpartum females were conditioned to
   associate one unique context in the CPP apparatus with young offspring
   (pups) and a second context with I neutral Stimulus. and virgin females
   were conditioned to associate unique contexts with cocaine (5 mg/kg ip)
   and saline injections Immediately before CPP testing each female
   received a microinfusion of bupivacaine bilaterally into the VTA to
   transiently inactivate the region, subjects were also tested after
   saline microinfusion into the VTA Postpartum females' preference for the
   pup-paired context was abolished by VTA Inactivation bill was restored
   to high control levels after saline microinfusion In separate tests. VTA
   Inactivation also reduced motivated PLIP licking and pup retrieval in
   postpartum females, suggesting that intact VTA function is required for
   the expression of both pup CPP and motivated pup-directed behaviors
   Cocaine CPP remained Unaffected by VTA Inactivation. Locomotion was not
   affected by VTA microinfusions but was severely impaired by bupivacaine
   microinfusions into the substantia nigra. We concluded that the VTA is
   differentially Involved in the expression of conditioned preference for

Abstract = {{The current study investigated memory for sequentially presented objects
   in young rats 6 months old (n = 12) and aged rats 24 months old (n =
   12). Rats were tested on a task involving three exploratory trials and
   one probe test During the exploratory trials. the rat explored a set of
   three sequentially presented object pairs (A-A, B-B. and C-C) for 5 min
   per pair with a 3-min delay between each pair Following the exploratory
   trials. a probe test was conducted where the rat was presented
   Simultaneously with one object from the first exploratory trial (A) and
   one object from the third exploratory trial (C) Results from the
   exploratory trials showed no significant age-related differences in
   exploration, indicating, that 24-month-old rats explored the object
   pairs as much as 6-month-old rats The probe test demonstrated that
   6-month-old rats spent significantly more time exploring object A
   compared to object C. indicating that voting rats show intact temporal
   order memory for the exploratory trial objects However, 24-month-old
   rats showed no preference for object A and spent a relatively equal
   amount of time exploring objects A and C The result,, suggest that
   temporal order memory declines as a result of age-related changes in the
   rodent brain The findings also may reflect differences in attraction to
   objects with different memory strengths Since age-related differences
   were not detected during the exploratory trials. age-related differences
   on the probe trial were not due solely to decreased exploration,
   motivation, or locomotion}},

Abstract = {{The experiment monitored eyelid responses bilaterally during delay
   eyeblink conditioning in rat. Rats were given paired or unpaired
   training with a tone or light conditioned stimulus (CS) and a unilateral
   periorbital shock unconditioned stimulus (US) Rats given paired training
   acquired high levels of conditioned responses (CRs), which occurred in
   both eyelids. However, acquisition was faster, and the overall
   percentage of CRs was greater in the eyelid that was ipsilateral to the
   US CRs in the eyelid ipsilateral to the US also had shorter onset
   latencies and larger amplitudes than CRs in the contralateral eyelid
   Both eyelids consistently showed high percentages of unconditioned
   responses (UR) to the US, and the UR amplitude decreased across training
   sessions in the paired group. The present study demonstrated that CRs
   occur robustly in both eyelids of rats given eyeblink conditioning,
   which is similar to previous findings in humans and monkeys. The results
   also showed that conditioning occurs more prominently in the eyelid that
   is ipsilateral to the US, which is similar to previous findings in
   humans, monkeys, dogs, and rabbits.}},
