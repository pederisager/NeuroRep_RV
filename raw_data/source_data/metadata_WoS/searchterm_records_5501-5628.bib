Abstract = {{Previous neuropsychological studies indicate that OCD subtypes such as
   checking rituals might be associated with a working memory deficit. On
   the other hand, functional neuroimaging studies found functional
   abnormalities of the frontal cortex and subcortical structures in OCD.
   Combined with functional imaging method, we applied neuropsychological
   batteries to demonstrate a working memory deficit in OCD by comparison
   with normal controls. In addition, working memory and brain activation
   were further examined with symptom-based analysis. Forty patients with
   OCD and 25 normal controls were examined using neuropsychological tests
   including the WAIS-R, WCST, WMS-R, and R-OCFT and functional MRI (fMRI)
   during the N-back task including 0- and 2-back task. On fMRI, the brain
   regions activated during the performance and the differences in the
   activation between patients and controls were identified. Additional
   analyses of severity and subtypes were conducted by using Y-BOCS
   severity score, symptom-checklist and Leckman's four-factor model,
   respectively. On the neuropsychological tests, the OCD patients had
   significantly lower scores on the delayed recall section of the WMS-R
   and the immediate recall section of the R-OCFT compared to the controls.
   On fMRI, the patients showed greater activation in the right
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), left superior temporal gyrus
   (STG), left insula, and cuneus during two-back task compared to the
   controls. Right orbitofrontal cortex activity showed a significant
   positive correlation with Y-BOCS scores in OCD. Furthermore, patients
   with obsessions/checking rituals (n = 10) showed severer memory deficits
   and decreased activity in the postcentral gyrus than patients with
   cleanliness/washing rituals (n = 14). In conclusion, we found
   neuropsychological dysfunction and brain abnormalities in OCD.
   Furthermore, our results suggested that symptom severity and symptom
   subtype such as obsessions/checking might affect neuropsychological
   dysfunction and related brain activities. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The present research examines whether cognitive load can modulate the
   processing of negative emotional stimuli, even after negative stimuli
   have already activated emotional centers of the brain. In a functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, participants viewed neutral and
   negative stimuli that were followed by an attention-demanding arithmetic
   task. As expected, exposure to negative stimuli led to increased
   activation in emotional regions (the amygdalae and the right insula).
   Subsequently induced task load led to increased activation in cognitive
   regions (right dorsolateral frontal cortex, right superior parietal
   cortex). Importantly, task load down-regulated the brain's response to
   negative stimuli in emotional regions. Task load also reduced
   subjectively experienced negative emotion in response to negative
   stimuli. Finally, coactivation analyses suggest that during task
   performance, activity in right dorsolateral frontal cortex was related
   to activity in the amygdalae and the right insula. Together, these
   findings indicate that cognitive load is capable of tuning down the
   emotional brain. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{For successful interpersonal communication, inferring intentions, goals
   or desires of others is highly advantageous. Increasingly, humans also
   interact with computers or robots. In this study, we sought to determine
   to what degree an interactive task, which involves receiving feedback
   from social partners that can be used to infer intent, engaged the
   medial prefrontal cortex, a region previously associated with Theory of
   Mind processes among others. Participants were scanned using fMRI as
   they played an adapted version of the Prisoner's Dilemma Game with
   alleged human and computer partners who were outside the scanner. The
   medial frontal cortex was activated when both human and computer partner
   were played, while the direct contrast revealed significantly stronger
   signal change during the human-human interaction. The results suggest a
   link between activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and the partner
   played in a mentalising task. This signal change was also present for to
   the computers partner. Implying agency or a will to non-human actors
   might be an innate human resource that could lead to an evolutionary

Abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of emotion,
   personality, and social cognition have drawn much attention in recent
   years, with high-profile studies frequently reporting extremely high
   (e.g., >.8) correlations between brain activation and personality
   measures. We show that these correlations are higher than should be
   expected given the (evidently limited) reliability of both fMRI and
   personality measures. The high correlations are all the more puzzling
   because method sections rarely contain much detail about how the
   correlations were obtained. We surveyed authors of 55 articles that
   reported findings of this kind to determine a few details on how these
   correlations were computed. More than half acknowledged using a strategy
   that computes separate correlations for individual voxels and reports
   means of only those voxels exceeding chosen thresholds. We show how this
   nonindependent analysis inflates correlations while yielding
   reassuring-looking scattergrams. This analysis technique was used to
   obtain the vast majority of the implausibly high correlations in our
   survey sample. In addition, we argue that, in some cases, other analysis
   problems likely created entirely spurious correlations. We outline how
   the data from these studies could be reanalyzed with unbiased methods to
   provide accurate estimates of the correlations in question and urge
   authors to perform such reanalyses. The underlying problems described
   here appear to be common in fMRI research of many kinds-not just in
   studies of emotion, personality, and social cognition.}},

Abstract = {{Vul, Harris, Winkielman, and Pashler (2009, this issue) claim that many
   brain-personality correlations in fMRI studies are ``likely ...
   spurious{''} (p. 274), and ``should not be believed{''} (p. 285).
   Several of their conclusions are incorrect. First, they incorrectly
   claim that whole-brain regressions use an invalid and
   ``nonindependent{''} two-step inferential procedure, a determination
   based on a survey sent to researchers that only included nondiagnostic
   questions about the descriptive process of plotting one's data. We
   explain how whole-brain regressions are a valid single-step method of
   identifying brain regions that have reliable correlations with
   individual difference measures. Second, they claim that large
   correlations from whole-brain regression analyses may be the result of
   noise alone. We provide a simulation to demonstrate that typical fMRI
   sample sizes will only rarely produce large correlations in the absence
   of any true effect. Third, they claim that the reported correlations are
   inflated to the point of being ``implausibly high.{''} Though biased
   post hoc correlation estimates are a well-known consequence of
   conducting multiple tests, Vul et al. make inaccurate assumptions when
   estimating the theoretical ceiling of such correlations. Moreover, their
   own ``meta-analysis{''} suggests that the magnitude of the bias is
   approximately .12-a rather modest bias.}},

Abstract = {{Speech perception is an essential part of social interaction. Visual
   information (lip movements, facial expression) may supplement auditory
   information in particular under inadvertent listening situations.
   Schizophrenia patients have been shown to have a deficit in integrating
   articulatory motions with the auditory speech input. The goal of this
   study was to investigate the neural basis of this deficit in audiovisual
   speech processing in schizophrenia patients by using fMRI Disyllabic
   nouns were presented in congruent (audio matches visual information) and
   incongruent conditions in a slow event related fMRI design.
   Schizophrenia patients (n = 15) were compared to age and gender matched
   control participants. The statistical examination was conducted by
   analysis of variance with main factors: audiovisual congruency and group
   membership. The patients' brain activity differed from the control group
   as evidenced by congruency by group interaction effects. The pertinent
   brain sites were located predominantly in the right hemisphere and
   comprised the pars opercularis, middle frontal sulcus, and superior
   temporal gyrus. In addition, we observed interactions bilaterally in the
   fusiform gyrus and the nucleus accumbens. We suggest that schizophrenia
   patients' deficits in audiovisual integration during speech perception
   are due to a dysfunction of the speech motor system in the right
   hemisphere. Furthermore the results can be also seen as a reflection of
   reduced lateralization of language functions to the left hemisphere in
   schizophrenia. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and the
   electroencephalography (EEG)-based technology of Brain Fingerprinting
   have been hailed as the next, best technologies for lie detection in
   America, particularly in the context of post-9/11 anxiety. In scientific
   journals and the popular press, each has been juxtaposed and deemed
   superior to traditional polygraphy, which measures changes in the
   autonomic nervous system and correlates these fluctuations with emotions
   such as anxiety, fear, and guilt. The author contends that the
   juxtaposition of polygraphy and brain-based detection is a rhetorical
   strategy that foregrounds the corrective advantage of brain-based
   techniques, creates an artificial rupture between contiguous
   technologies, and ignores the shared assumptions foundational to fMRI,
   EEG, and two older ``truth telling'' technologies: polygraphy and
   fingerprinting. Far from describing the brain and its functions, fMRI
   and Brain Fingerprinting produce models of the brain that reinforce
   social notions of deception, truth, and deviance.}},

Abstract = {{During the past 20 years there has been much research into the factors
   that modulate awareness of contralesional information in neurological
   patients with visual neglect or extinction. However, the potential role
   of the individual's emotional state in modulating awareness has been
   largely overlooked. In the current study, we induced a pleasant and
   positive affective response in patients with chronic visual neglect by
   allowing them to listen to their pleasant preferred music. We report
   that the patients showed enhanced visual awareness when tasks were
   performed under preferred music conditions relative to when tasks were
   performed either with unpreferred music or in silence. These results
   were also replicated when positive affect was induced before neglect was
   tested. Functional MRI data showed enhanced activity in the
   orbitofrontal cortex and the cingulate gyrus associated with emotional
   responses when tasks were performed with preferred music relative to
   unpreferred music. Improved awareness of contralesional (left) targets
   with preferred music was also associated with a strong functional
   coupling between emotional areas and attentional brain regions in spared
   areas of the parietal cortex and early visual areas of the right
   hemisphere. These findings suggest that positive affect, generated by
   preferred music, can decrease visual neglect by increasing attentional
   resources. We discuss the possible roles of arousal and mood in
   generating these effects.}},

Abstract = {{Prior studies report that accidents involving intoxicated drivers are
   more likely to occur during performance of secondary tasks. We studied
   this phenomenon, using a dual-task paradigm, involving performance of a
   visual oddball (VO) task while driving in an alcohol challenge paradigm.
   Previous functional MRI (fMRI) studies of the VO task have shown
   activation in the anterior cingulate, hippocampus, and prefrontal
   cortex. Thus, we predicted dose-dependent decreases in activation of
   these areas during VO performance.
   Forty healthy social drinkers were administered 3 different doses of
   alcohol, individually tailored to their gender and weight. Participants
   performed a VO task while operating a virtual reality driving simulator
   in a 3T fMRI scanner.
   Analysis showed a dose-dependent linear decrease in Blood Oxygen Level
   Dependent activation during task performance, primarily in hippocampus,
   anterior cingulate, and dorsolateral prefrontal areas, with the least
   activation occurring during the high dose. Behavioral analysis showed a
   dose-dependent linear increase in reaction time, with no effects
   associated with either correct hits or false alarms. In all dose
   conditions, driving speed decreased significantly after a VO stimulus.
   However, at the high dose this decrease was significantly less.
   Passenger-side line crossings significantly increased at the high dose.
   These results suggest that driving impairment during secondary task
   performance may be associated with alcohol-related effects on the above
   brain regions, which are involved with attentional
   processing/decision-making. Drivers with high blood alcohol
   concentrations may be less able to orient or detect novel or sudden
   stimuli during driving.}},

Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Numerous studies have identified an anterior temporal lobe (ATL) region
   that responds preferentially to sentence-level stimuli. It is unclear,
   however, whether this activity reflects a response to syntactic
   computations or some form of semantic integration. This distinction is
   difficult to investigate with the stimulus manipulations and anomaly
   detection paradigms traditionally implemented. The present functional
   magnetic resonance imaging study addresses this question via a selective
   attention paradigm. Subjects monitored for occasional semantic anomalies
   or occasional syntactic errors, thus directing their attention to
   semantic integration, or syntactic properties of the sentences. The
   hemodynamic response in the sentence-selective ATL region (defined with
   a localizer scan) was examined during anomaly/error-free sentences only,
   to avoid confounds due to error detection. The majority of the
   sentence-specific region of interest was equally modulated by attention
   to syntactic or compositional semantic features, whereas a smaller
   subregion was only modulated by the semantic task. We suggest that the
   sentence-specific ATL region is sensitive to both syntactic and
   integrative semantic functions during sentence processing, with a
   smaller portion of this area preferentially involved in the later. This
   study also suggests that selective attention paradigms may be effective
   tools to investigate the functional diversity of networks involved in
   sentence processing.}},

Abstract = {{Humans are unique in being able to reflect on their own performance. For

   another group that we were simply optimizing task parameters, we managed
   to enhance the motivation to do well in the first group. We matched the
   performance between the groups. During functional magnetic resonance
   imaging, the motivated group showed enhanced activity when making
   errors. This activity was extensive, including the anterior
   paracingulate cortex, lateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex. These
   areas showed enhanced interaction with each other. The anterior

Abstract = {{Introduction.-Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a
   common and impairing neuropsychiatric disorder with preschool onset.
   ADHD occurs in approximately 3-9\% of the childhood population. There is
   a much higher incidence rate in boys who are around three times more
   likely than girls to be diagnosed. Approximately 30-60\% of individuals
   diagnosed with ADHD in youth have symptoms that persist into adulthood.
   Literature findings.-Three subtypes of the disorder have been proposed
   in the current clinical view of ADHD: inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive
   and combined type. Numerous problems are associated with ADHD: poor
   academic performance, learning disorders, subtle cognitive deficits,
   conduct disorders, antisocial personality disorder, poor social
   relationships, and a higher incidence of anxiety and depression symptoms
   into adulthood. Researchers have emphasized poor behavioural inhibition
   as the central impairment of the disorder. From the neuropsychological
   viewpoint, impairment of the ``hot{''} affective aspects of executive
   functions, like behavioural inhibition and attention and the more
   cognitive, ``cool{''} aspects of executive functions like
   self-regulation, working memory, planning, and cognitive flexibility,
   are often reported by studies on ADHD. The hot executive functions are
   associated with ventral and medial regions of the prefrontal cortex
   (including the anterior cingulated cortex) and named ``hotbrain{''} and
   the cool executive functions are associated with the dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex and are called ``coolbrain{''}.
   Discussion.-Convergent data from neuroimaging, neuropsychology, genetics
   and neurochemical studies consistently point to the involvement of the
   frontostriatal network as a likely contributor to the pathophysiology of
   ADHD. This network involves the lateral prefrontal cortex, the dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex, the caudate nucleus and putamen. Moreover, a
   growing literature demonstrates abnormalities affecting other cortical
   regions and the cerebellum. The exploratory brain regions of interest in
   which abnormalities have been identified, but that were not predicted by
   cognitive models of ADHD, are the temporal lobe, parietal lobe,
   occipital lobe and lateral ventricles. Anatomical studies suggest
   widespread reductions in volume throughout the cerebrum and cerebellum,
   white functional imaging studies suggest that affected individuals
   activate more diffuse areas than controls during the performance of
   cognitive tasks. More precisely, reductions in volume have been observed
   in the total cerebral volume, the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia
   (striatum), the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, the corpus callosum
   and the cerebellum. Furthermore, hypoactivation of the dorsal anterior
   cingulate cortex, the frontal cortex and the basal ganglia (striatum)
   have also been reported. The paradigms mostly used in functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are tasks of motor inhibition,
   interference and attention such as the go/no-go, ``stop-signal{''} and
   the Stroop.
   Conclusion.-This review provides an overview of the main imaging studies
   that investigated the neurobiological substrate of ADHD. Some guidelines
   for future functional magnetic imaging studies are also suggested. (C)

Abstract = {{Human and non-human primates follow the gaze of their respective
   conspecific to identify objects of common interest. Whereas humans rely
   on eye-gaze for such purposes, monkeys preferentially use head-gaze
   information. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have
   delineated an area in the human superior temporal sulcus (STS), which is
   specifically activated when subjects actively follow the eye-gaze of
   others. Similarly, using fMRI, we have identified an analogous region in
   the monkey's middle STS responding to gaze following. Hence, although
   humans and monkeys might rely on different directional cues guiding
   their attention, they seem to deploy a similar and possibly homologous
   cortical area to follow the gaze of a conspecific. Our results support
   the idea that the eyes developed a new social function in human
   evolution, most likely to support cooperative mutual social interactions
   building on a phylogenetically old STS module for the processing of head
   cues.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to perceive facial motion is important to successfully
   interact in social environments. Previously, imaging studies have
   investigated neural correlates of facial motion primarily using abstract
   motion stimuli. Here, we studied how the brain processes natural
   non-rigid facial motion in direct comparison to static stimuli and
   matched phase-scrambled controls. As predicted from previous studies,
   dynamic faces elicit higher responses than static faces in lateral
   temporal areas corresponding to hMT+/V5 and STS. Interestingly,
   individually defined, static-face-sensitive regions in bilateral
   fusiform gyrus and left inferior occipital gyrus also respond more to
   dynamic than static faces. These results suggest integration of form and
   motion information during the processing of dynamic faces even in
   ventral temporal and inferior lateral occipital areas. In addition, our
   results show that dynamic stimuli are a robust tool to localize areas
   related to the processing of static and dynamic face information.}},

Abstract = {{Driving while intoxicated remains a major public health hazard. Driving
   is a complex task involving Simultaneous recruitment Of multiple
   cognitive functions. The investigators studied the neutral substrates of
   driving and their response to different blood alcohol concentrations
   (BACs), using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a virtual
   reality driving simulator. We used independent component analysis (ICA)
   to isolate spatially independent and temporally correlated
   driving-related brain circuits in 40 healthy, adult moderate social
   drinkers. Each subject received three individualized, separate
   single-blind doses of beverage alcohol to produce BACs of 0.05\%
   (moderate), 0.10\%, (high), or 0\%, (placebo). 3 T fMRI scanning and
   continuous behavioral measurement Occurred during simulated driving.
   Brain function was assessed and compared using both ICA and a
   conventional general linear model (GLM) analysis. ICA results replicated
   and significantly extended our previous 1.5T study (Calhoun et al.
   {[}2004a]: Neuropsychopharmacology 29:2097-2017). GLM analysis revealed
   significant dose-related functional differences, complementing ICA data.
   Driving behaviors including opposite white line crossings and mean speed
   independently demonstrated significant dose-dependent changes.
   Behavior-based factors also predicted a frontal-basal-temporal circuit
   to be functionally impaired with alcohol dosage across baseline scaled,
   good versus poorly performing drivers. We report neural correlates of
   driving behavior and found dose-related spatio-temporal disruptions in
   critical driving-associated regions including the Superior, middle and
   orbito frontal gyri, anterior cingulate, primary/supplementary motor
   areas, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Overall, results Suggest that
   alcohol (especially at high doses) causes significant impairment of both
   driving behavior and brain functionality related to motor planning and
   control, goal directedness, error monitoring, and memory. Hum Brain Mapp

Abstract = {{Psychometric studies of risk perception have categorized personal risks
   into social and physical domains. To investigate whether and how the
   human brain differentiates social and physical risks, we scanned human
   adults using functional magnetic resonance imaging when they identified
   potential risks involved in social and physical behaviors. We found that
   the identification of risky behaviors in both domains induced increased
   activations in the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC,
   BA9/10)/ventral anterior cingulate (ACC) and posterior cingulate (PCC)
   relative to identification of safe behaviors. However, social risks
   induced stronger anterior MPFC activation whereas physical risks were
   associated with stronger ventral ACC activity. In addition, anterior
   MPFC activity was negatively correlated with the rating scores of the
   degree of social risk whereas PCC activity was positively correlated
   with the rating scores of the degree of physical risk. Relative to an
   autobiographical control task, the social risk identification task
   induced stronger sustained activity in the left supplementary motor
   area/dorsal ACC and increased transient activity in bilateral posterior
   insula. The physical risk identification task, however, resulted in
   stronger sustained activity in the right cuneus/precuneus and increased
   transient activation in bilateral amygdala. Our results indicate the
   existence of distinct neural mechanisms underlying social and physical
   risk identifications and provide neural bases for the psychometric
   categorization of risks into different domains. Hum Brain Mapp

Abstract = {{The functional catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT Val108/158Met)
   polymorphism has been shown to have an impact on tasks of executive
   function, memory and attention and recently, tasks with an affective
   component. As oestrogen reduces COMT activity, we focused on the
   interaction between gender and COMT genotype on brain activations during
   an affective processing task. We used functional MRI (fMRI) to record
   brain activations from 74 healthy subjects who engaged in a facial
   affect recognition task; subjects viewed and identified fearful compared
   to neutral faces. There was no main effect of the COMT polymorphism,
   gender or genotype x gender interaction on task performance. We found a
   significant effect of gender on brain activations in the left amygdala
   and right temporal pole, where females demonstrated increased
   activations over males. Within these regions, Val/Val carriers showed
   greater signal magnitude compared to Met/Met carriers, particularly in
   females. The COMT Val108/158Met polymorphism impacts on gender-related
   patterns of activation in limbic and paralimbic regions but the
   functional significance of any oestrogen-related COMT inhibition appears
   modest.}},

Abstract = {{Two experiments explored the neural mechanisms underlying the learning
   and consolidation of novel spoken words. In Experiment 1, participants
   learned two sets of novel words on successive days. A subsequent
   recognition test revealed high levels of familiarity for both sets.
   However, a lexical decision task showed that only novel words learned on
   the previous day engaged in lexical competition with similar-sounding
   existing words. Additionally, only novel words learned on the previous
   day exhibited faster repetition latencies relative to unfamiliar
   controls. This overnight consolidation effect was further examined using
   fMRI to compare neural responses to existing and novel words learned on
   different days prior to scanning (Experiment 2). This revealed an
   elevated response for novel compared with existing words in left
   superior temporal gyrus (STG), inferior frontal and premotor regions,
   and right cerebellum. Cortical activation was of equivalent magnitude
   for unfamiliar novel words and items learned on the day of scanning but
   significantly reduced for novel words learned on the previous day. In
   contrast, hippocampal responses were elevated for novel words that were
   entirely unfamiliar, and this elevated response correlated with
   postscanning behavioral measures of word learning. These findings are
   consistent with a dual-learning system account in which there is a
   division of labor between medial-temporal systems that are involved in
   initial acquisition and neocortical systems in which representations of
   novel spoken words are subject to overnight consolidation.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral economists have proposed that money illusion, which is a
   deviation from rationality in which individuals engage in nominal
   evaluation, can explain a wide range of important economic and social
   phenomena. This proposition stands in sharp contrast to the standard
   economic assumption of rationality that requires individuals to judge
   the value of money only on the basis of the bundle of goods that it can
   buy-its real value-and not on the basis of the actual amount of
   currency-its nominal value. We used fMRI to investigate whether the
   brain's reward circuitry exhibits money illusion. Subjects received
   prizes in 2 different experimental conditions that were identical in
   real economic terms, but differed in nominal terms. Thus, in the absence
   of money illusion there should be no differences in activation in
   reward-related brain areas. In contrast, we found that areas of the
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), which have been previously
   associated with the processing of anticipatory and experienced rewards,
   and the valuation of goods, exhibited money illusion. We also found that
   the amount of money illusion exhibited by the vmPFC was correlated with
   the amount of money illusion exhibited in the evaluation of economic
   transactions.}},

Title = {{Offline Memory Reprocessing: Involvement of the Brain's Default Network
   in Spontaneous Thought Processes}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Spontaneous thought processes (STPs), also called
   daydreaming or mind-wandering, occur ubiquitously in daily life.
   However, the functional significance of STPs remains largely unknown.
   Methodology/Principal Finding: Using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI), we first identified an STPs-network whose activity was
   positively correlated with the subjects' tendency of having STPs during
   a task-free state. The STPs-network was then found to be strongly
   associated with the default network, which has previously been
   established as being active during the task-free state. Interestingly,
   we found that offline reprocessing of previously memorized information
   further increased the activity of the STPs-network regions, although
   during a state with less STPs. In addition, we found that the
   STPs-network kept a dynamic balance between functional integration and
   functional separation among its component regions to execute offline
   memory reprocessing in STPs.
   Conclusion/Significance: These findings strengthen a view that offline
   memory reprocessing and STPs share the brain's default network, and thus
   implicate that offline memory reprocessing may be a predetermined
   function of STPs. This supports the perspective that memory can be
   consolidated and modified during STPs, and thus gives rise to a dynamic
   behavior dependent on both previous external and internal experiences.}},

Abstract = {{We tested the association between theory of mind (ToM) performance and
   structural changes in the brains of patients in the early course of
   schizophrenia.
   Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) data of 18 patients with schizophrenia
   were compared with those of 21 controls. ToM skills were assessed by
   computerized faux pas (FP) tasks.
   Patients with schizophrenia performed significantly worse in FP tasks
   than healthy subjects. VBM revealed significantly reduced gray matter
   density in certain frontal, temporal and subcortical regions in patients
   with schizophrenia. Poor FP performance of schizophrenics correlated
   with gray matter reduction in the left orbitofrontal cortex and right
   temporal pole.
   Our data indicate an association between poor ToM performance and
   regional gray matter reduction in the left orbitofrontal cortex and
   right temporal pole shortly after the onset of schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{Inappropriate social behaviours are early and distinctive symptoms of
   the temporal and frontal variants of frontotemporal lobar degeneration
   (FTLD). Knowledge of social behaviour is essential for appropriate
   social conduct. It is unknown, however, in what way this knowledge is
   degraded in FTLD. In a recent functional MRI study, we have identified a
   right-lateralized superior anterior temporal lobe (aTL) region showing
   selective activation for social concepts (i.e. concepts describing
   social behaviour: e.g. polite, stingy) as compared with concepts
   describing less socially relevant animal behaviour (animal function
   concepts: e.g. trainable, nutritious). In a further fMRI study, superior
   aTL activation was independent of the context of actions and feelings
   associated with these social concepts. Here, we investigated whether the
   right superior sector of the aTL is necessary for context-independent
   knowledge of social concepts. We assessed neuronal glucose uptake using
   18-fluoro-deoxy-glucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and a
   novel semantic discrimination task which probed knowledge of social and
   animal function concepts in patients with FTLD (n 29) and corticobasal
   syndrome (n 18). FTLD and corticobasal syndrome groups performed equally
   poorly on animal function concepts but FTLD patients showed more
   pronounced impairments on social concepts than corticobasal syndrome
   patients. FTLD patients with right superior aTL hypometabolism, as
   determined on individual ROI analyses, were significantly more impaired
   on social concepts than on animal function concepts. FTLD patients with
   selective impairments for social concepts, as determined on individual
   neuropsychological profiles, showed higher levels of inappropriate
   social behaviours (disinhibition) and demonstrated more pronounced
   hypometabolism in the right superior aTL, the left temporal pole and the
   right lateral orbitofrontal and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex as
   compared with FTLD patients showing selective impairments of animal
   function concepts. Combining both FTLD subgroup analyses, based on
   anatomical and neuropsychological criteria, by using inclusive masks,
   revealed the right superior aTL as associated with selective impairments
   of social concepts in both analyses. These results corroborate the
   hypothesis that the right aTL is necessary for representing conceptual
   social knowledge. Further, we provide first evidence for the potential
   importance of conceptual social knowledge impairments as contributing to
   behavioural symptoms of FTLD.}},

Abstract = {{Perception of emotion is critical for successful social interaction, yet
   the neural mechanisms underlying the perception of dynamic, audio-visual
   emotional cues are poorly understood. Evidence from language and sensory
   paradigms suggests that the superior temporal sulcus and gyrus (STS/STG)
   play a key role in the integration of auditory and visual cues. Emotion
   perception research has focused on static facial cues; however, dynamic
   audio-visual (AV) cues mimic real-world social cues more accurately than
   static and/or unimodal stimuli. Novel dynamic AV stimuli were presented
   using a block design in two fMRI studies, comparing bimodal stimuli to
   unimodal conditions, and emotional to neutral stimuli. Results suggest
   that the bilateral superior temporal region plays distinct roles in the
   perception of emotion and in the integration of auditory and visual
   cues. Given the greater ecological validity of the stimuli developed for
   this study, this paradigm may be helpful in elucidating the deficits in
   emotion perception experienced by clinical populations. (C) 2008

Abstract = {{Human communicational interaction can be mediated by a host of

   found that comprehension of material signals activates bilaterally areas
   of the ventral stream and pars triangularis of the inferior frontal
   cortex, that is, areas traditionally associated with verbal language and
   semantics. In addition, we found that right-hemisphere inferior frontal
   cortex is recruited as a function of the increasing unconventionality of
   communicative objects. Together these findings support an interpretation
   of the traditional language areas as playing a more general role across
   modalities in relation to communicational mediation of social semantic

   motivational processes of gains and losses in playing against a human or
   a computer opponent. We delineate a network, consisting of bilateral
   temporoparietal junction, temporal pole (TP), medial prefrontal cortex
   (MPFC) and right fusiform gyrus, which is sensitive to the opponent's
   response (challenging>not challenging the player) and opponent type
   (human>computer). This network is similar to a known explicit `off-line'
   mentalization circuit, suggesting its additional involvement in implicit
   `on-line' mentalization, a process more applicable to real-life social
   interactions. Importantly, only MPFC and TP were selective to
   mentalization compared to motivation, highlighting their specific

Abstract = {{Background
   There is relatively little existing information regarding the neural
   correlates of deception in individuals with psychopathic traits.
   Aims
   To investigate the relationship between neural responses during
   deception and psychopathic personality traits in a sample of male
   participants drawn from the normal population.
   Method
   Twenty-four male participants carried out a simple deception paradigm
   while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Psychopathic
   traits were assessed in the sample using the Psychopathic Personality
   Inventory (PPI)
   Results
   Mean response times were greater for the lie than truth condition. Lie
   responses resulted in enhanced activation of the ventrolateral
   prefrontal cortex. The PPI sub-scales, coldheartedness, fearlessness,
   Machavellian egocentricity, social potency and stress immunity were
   found to be correlated with activation patterns in the brain circuitry
   implicated in both deception and related processes such as behavioural
   restraint and social cognition.
   Conclusions
   This is a novel technology that may prove useful in our understanding of
   some of the key components of the psychopathy construct in both clinical
   and non-clinical contexts}},

Abstract = {{Afferent feedback from muscles and skin has been suggested to influence
   our emotions during the control of facial expressions. Recent imaging
   studies have shown that imitation of facial expressions is associated
   with activation in limbic regions such as the amygdala. Yet, the
   physiological interaction between this limbic activation and facial
   feedback remains unclear. To study if facial feedback effects on limbic
   brain responses during intentional imitation of facial expressions, we
   applied botulinum toxin (BTX)-induced denervation of frown muscles in
   combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging as a reversible
   lesion model to minimize the occurrence of afferent muscular and
   cutaneous input. We show that, during imitation of angry facial
   expressions, reduced feedback due to BTX treatment attenuates activation
   of the left amygdala and its functional coupling with brain stem regions
   implicated in autonomic manifestations of emotional states. These
   findings demonstrate that facial feedback modulates neural activity
   within central circuitries of emotion during intentional imitation of
   facial expressions. Given that people tend to mimic the emotional
   expressions of others, this could provide a potential physiological
   basis for the social transfer of emotion.}},

Abstract = {{Trying to understand others is the most pervasive aspect of successful
   social interaction. To date there is no evidence on whether human
   products, which signal the workings of a mind in the absence of an
   explicit agent, also reliably engage neural structures typically
   associated with mental state attribution. By means of functional
   magnetic resonance imaging the present study shows that when subjects
   believe they are listening to a piece of music that was written by a
   composer (i.e., human product) as opposed to generated by a computer
   (i.e., nonhuman product), activations in the cortical network typically
   reported for mental state attribution (anterior medial frontal cortex
   {[}aMFC]), superior temporal sulcus, and temporal poles) were observed.
   The activation in the aMFC correlated highly with the extent to which
   subjects had engaged in attributing the expression of intentions to the
   composed pieces, as indicated in a postimaging questionnaire. We
   interpret these findings as indicative of automatic mechanisms, which
   reflect mental state attribution in the face of any stimulus that
   potentially signals the working of another mind and conclude that even
   in the absence of a socially salient stimulus, our environment is still
   populated by the indirect social signals inherent to human artifacts.}},

Abstract = {{The tuning-fork model of human social cognition, based on the discovery
   of mirror neurons (MNs) in the ventral premotor cortex of monkeys,
   involves the four following assumptions: (1) mirroring processes are
   processes of resonance or simulation. (2) They can be motor or
   non-motor. (3) Processes of motor mirroring (or action-mirroring),
   exemplified by the activity of MNs, constitute instances of third-person
   mindreading, whereby an observer represents the agent's intention. (4)
   Non-motor mirroring processes enable humans to represent others'
   emotions. After questioning all four assumptions, I point out that MNs
   in an observer's brain could not synchronically resonate with MNs in an
   agent's brain unless they discharged in a single brain in two distinct
   tasks at different times. Finally, I sketch a conceptualist alternative
   to the resonance model according to which a brain mechanism active in
   both the execution and the perception of e.g., the act of grasping is
   the neural basis of the concept of e.g., grasping. (C) 2009 Published by

Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{In this fMRI study we investigated functional connectivity between
   components of the mentalising system during a social emotion task, using
   psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis. Ten adults (22-32 years)
   and 18 adolescents (11-18 years) were scanned while thinking about
   scenarios in which a social or a basic emotion would be experienced.
   Unlike basic emotions (such as disgust and fear), social emotions (such
   as embarrassment and guilt) require the representation of another's
   mental states. In both adults and adolescents, an anterior rostral
   region of medial prefrontal cortex (arMPFC) involved in mentalising
   showed greater connectivity with the posterior superior temporal sulcus
   (pSTS) bordering on the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and with
   anterior temporal cortex (ATC) during social than during basic emotion.
   This result provides novel evidence that components of the mentalising
   system interact functionally during a social emotion task. Furthermore,
   functional connectivity differed between adolescence and adulthood. The
   adolescent group showed stronger connectivity between arMPFC and
   pSTS/TPJ during social relative to basic emotion than did the adult
   group, suggestive of developmental changes in functional integration
   within the mentalising system.}},

Abstract = {{A large body of research indicates a critical role for the left
   mid-fusiform cortex in reading, however, the extent to which this area
   is dedicated exclusively to the processing of words and letters has been
   debated. Two questions regarding left mid-fusiform function are critical
   to this debate: (1) Are letters stored preferentially compared to
   visually equivalent non-letters (letter selectivity)? (2) Are letter
   representations abstract with respect to changes in letter case (e.g.,
   A/a; case invariance)? The present study addressed these questions by
   comparing priming for letters and pseudoletters in left and right
   mid-fusiform regions using functional magnetic resonance imaging while
   subjects performed a same/different matching task. Results revealed
   priming for letters but not pseudoletters in the left mid-fusiform
   region, suggesting that representations are letter selective. However,
   no priming for different-case-primed letters was observed in this
   region, indicating that representations are not case invariant. In
   addition, priming for pseudoletters but not letters was observed in the
   homologous right mid-fusiform region. Overall, findings contradict
   strongly modular theories of letter/word processing and suggest that
   left and right mid-fusiform regions support generic object processes
   that are differentially effective for representing disparate types of

Abstract = {{Viewing hand gestures during face-to-face communication affects speech
   perception and comprehension. Despite the visible role played by gesture
   in social interactions, relatively little is known about how the brain
   integrates hand gestures with co-occurring speech. Here we used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and an ecologically valid
   paradigm to investigate how beat gesture-a fundamental type of hand
   gesture that marks speech prosody-might impact speech perception at the
   neural level. Subjects underwent fMRI while listening to
   spontaneously-produced speech accompanied by beat gesture, nonsense hand
   movement, or a still body; as additional control conditions, subjects
   also viewed beat gesture, nonsense hand movement, or a still body all
   presented without speech. Validating behavioral evidence that gesture
   affects speech perception, bilateral nonprimary auditory cortex showed
   greater activity when speech was accompanied by beat gesture than when
   speech was presented alone. Further, the left superior temporal
   gyrus/sulcus showed stronger activity when speech was accompanied by
   beat gesture than when speech was accompanied by nonsense hand movement.
   Finally, the right planum temporale was identified as a putative
   multisensory integration site for beat gesture and speech (i.e., here
   activity in response to speech accompanied by beat gesture was greater
   than the summed responses to speech alone and beat gesture alone),
   indicating that this area may be pivotally involved in synthesizing the
   rhythmic aspects of both speech and gesture. Taken together, these
   findings suggest a common neural substrate for processing speech and
   gesture, likely reflecting their joint communicative role in social
   interactions. Hum Brain Mapp 30:1028-1037, 2009. (C) 2008 Wile.y-Liss,

Abstract = {{In this paper, we will examine and untangle a conflict mainly between a
   developmental psychologist, Martin Hoffman and a social psychologist,
   Daniel Batson. According to Hoffman, empathic distress, a vicarious
   feeling through empathy, is transformed into an altruistic motivation.
   Batson and others on the other hand, criticize Hoffman, claiming that
   empathic altruism has no relation with empathic distress. We will point
   out some problems with Batson's position by referring to the results of
   fMRI experiments that suggest empathic distress and empathic altruism
   share a common basis, and defend Hoffman's argument. This will also
   offer new insights into the evolution of empathy.}},

Abstract = {{Memory impairment has been acknowledged as a core cognitive deficit in
   schizophrenia, and it is present irrespective of specific features
   related to the patient or the evolution of the disorder. It is suggested
   that distinct functional subsystems of memory are differently impaired
   in these patients, hence the broad range of levels of functioning
   affected in this specific population. Die aim of this study was to
   assess working memory performance in multiple episode schizophrenia
   patients. A group of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and a control
   group of healthy subjects were comparatively evaluated with 3
   neurocognitive tests which require the use of working memory subsystems.
   Our results indicate significantly poorer performance in the case of
   patients suffering from schizophrenia, in all three working memory tests
   - they displayed impaired face recognition abilities and used a
   significantly higher number of non-list words when asked to repeat a
   list of words, which may be particularly relevant for their social
   functioning. The neurobiological and genetic background of the memory
   impairment in schizophrenia have been acknowledged due to increasing
   body of evidence, and the current study supports the current data which
   state that working memory deficits in schizophrenia are consistent,
   stable and comprehensive. This is particularly relevant for the personal
   management, and also for the academic, interpersonal and social
   rehabilitation of schizophrenia patients.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has focused on the disparate mechanisms that support the
   human ability to ``mentalize'' about the thoughts and feelings of
   others. One such process may rely on precompiled, semantic beliefs about
   the characteristics common to members of a social group, that is, on
   stereotypes; for example, judging that a woman may be more likely than a
   man to have certain interests or opinions. In the current study, we
   identified a pattern of neural activity associated with the use of
   stereotypes to judge another person's psychological characteristics.
   During fMRI scanning, participants mentalized about the likely responses
   of a female and male target to a series of questions, some of which were
   related to gender stereotypes ( e. g., ``enjoys shopping for new
   clothes''). Trials on which participants applied a stereotype were
   segregated from those on which participants avoided stereotype use. The
   BOLD response in an extensive region of the right frontal cortex
   differentiated stereotype-applied from-unapplied trials. Moreover, this
   neural difference was correlated with a behavioral index of gender
   associations-the Implicit Association Test administered after scanning.
   Results suggest that stereotype application may draw on cognitive
   processes that more generally subserve semantic knowledge about
   categories.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Aberrant brain activation during facial emotion
   discrimination has been described in chronic schizophrenia, while little
   is known about early stages of the illness. The aim of the current study
   was to investigate valence-specific brain activation of emotion
   discrimination in first-episode schizophrenia. These patients provide
   the advantage of lacking the effects of long-term medication and chronic
   illness course and can hence further enhance the understanding of
   underlying psychopathological mechanisms.
   Methods: Using event-related fMRI, we investigated 18 first-episode
   schizophrenia patients and 18 matched healthy subjects during an
   explicit emotion discrimination task presenting happy, sad and neutral
   monochromatic facial expressions. A repeated measure analysis of
   variance (ANOVA) with the factors Group (patients, healthy subjects),
   Gender and Emotion (happy, sad, neutral) was performed on behavioural
   and functional data.
   Results: Behavioural performance did not differ between groups.
   Valence-independent hypoactivations in patients were observed for the
   anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortex while hyperactivations
   emerged in the posterior cingulate and the precuneus. Emotion-specific
   group differences were revealed in inferior parietal and orbitofrontal
   brain areas and the hippocampus.
   Conclusions: First-episode schizophrenia already affects areas involved
   in processing of both, emotions and primary facial information. Our
   study underlines the role of dysfunctional neural networks as the basis
   of disturbed social interactions in early schizophrenia. (C) 2008

Abstract = {{What are the neural correlates of attractiveness? Using functional MRI
   (fMRI), the authors addressed this question in the specific context of
   the apprehension of faces. When subjects judged facial beauty
   explicitly, neural activity in a widely distributed network involving
   the ventral occipital, anterior insular, dorsal posterior parietal,
   inferior dorsolateral, and medial prefrontal cortices correlated
   parametrically with the degree of facial attractiveness. When subjects
   were not attending explicitly to attractiveness, but rather were judging
   facial identity, the ventral occipital region remained responsive to
   facial beauty. The authors propose that this region, which includes the
   fusiform face area (FFA), the lateral occipital cortex (LOC), and
   medially adjacent regions, is activated automatically by beauty and may
   serve as a neural trigger for pervasive effects of attractiveness in
   social interactions.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to detect and process errors made by others plays an
   important role is many social contexts. The capacity to process errors
   is typically found to rely on sites in the medial frontal cortex.
   However, it remains to be determined whether responses at these sites
   are driven primarily by action errors themselves or by the affective
   consequences normally associated with their commission. Using an
   experimental paradigm that disentangles action errors and the valence of
   their affective consequences, we demonstrate that sites in the medial
   frontal cortex (MFC), including the ventral anterior cingulate cortex
   (vACC) and pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), respond to action
   errors independent of the valence of their consequences. The strength of
   this response was negatively correlated with the empathic concern
   subscale of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index. We also demonstrate a
   main effect of self-identification by showing that errors committed by
   friends and foes elicited significantly different BOLD responses in a
   separate region of the middle anterior cingulate cortex (mACC). These
   results suggest that the way we look at others plays a critical role in
   determining patterns of brain activation during error observation. These
   findings may have important implications for general theories of error
   processing.}},

Abstract = {{It is known that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is crucially involved in
   emotion regulation. However, the specific role of the OFC in controlling
   the behavior evoked by these emotions, such as approachavoidance (AA)
   responses, remains largely unexplored. We measured behavioral and neural
   responses (using fMRI) during the performance of a social task, a
   reaction time (RT) task where subjects approached or avoided visually
   presented emotional faces by pulling or pushing a joystick,
   respectively. RTs were longer for affect-incongruent responses (approach
   angry faces and avoid happy faces) as compared to affect-congruent
   responses (approachhappy; avoidangry). Moreover, affect-incongruent
   responses recruited increased activity in the left lateral OFC. These
   behavioral and neural effects emerged only when the subjects responded
   explicitly to the emotional value of the faces (AA-task) and largely
   disappeared when subjects responded to an affectively irrelevant feature
   of the faces during a control (gender evaluation: GE) task. Most
   crucially, the size of the OFC-effect correlated positively with the
   size of the behavioral costs of approaching angry faces. These findings
   qualify the role of the lateral OFC in the voluntary control of
   socialmotivational behavior, emphasizing the relevance of this region
   for selecting rule-driven stimulusresponse associations, while
   overriding automatic (affect-congruent) stimulusresponse mappings.}},

Abstract = {{The neural correlates of cognitive control and social processing
   functions, as well as the characteristic patterns of anomalous brain
   activation patterns in psychiatric conditions associated with impairment
   in these functions, have been well characterized. However, these domains
   have primarily been examined in isolation. The present study used
   event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to map brain areas
   recruited during a target-detection task designed to evaluate responses
   to both non-social (i.e. shape) and social (i.e. face) target stimuli.
   Both shape and face targets activated a similar brain network, including
   the postcentral gyrus, the anterior and posterior cingulate gyri and the
   right midfrontal gyrus, whereas face targets additionally activated the
   thalamus, fusiform and temporooccipital cortex, lingual gyrus and
   paracingulate gyrus. Comparison of activations to social and non-social
   target events revealed that a small portion of the dorsal anterior
   cingulate gyrus (Brodmann's area 32) and the supracalcarine cortex were
   preferentially activated to face targets. These findings indicate that
   non-social and social stimuli embedded within a cognitive control task
   activate overlapping and distinct brain regions. Clinical cognitive
   neuroscience research of disorders characterized by cognitive
   dysfunction and impaired social processing would benefit from the use of
   tasks that evaluate the combined effects of deficits in these two
   domains.}},

Abstract = {{Although there is evidence of emotion perception deficits in autism
   spectrum disorder (ASD), research on this topic has been mostly confined
   to perception of emotions in faces. Using behavioral measures and 3T
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined whether such
   deficits extend to the perception of bodily expressed emotions. We found
   that individuals with ASD, in contrast to neurotypical (NT) individuals,
   did not exhibit a differential pattern of brain activation to bodies
   expressing fear as compared with emotionally neutral bodies. ASD and NT
   individuals showed similar patterns of activation in response to bodies
   engaged in emotionally neutral actions, with the exception of decreased
   activation in the inferior frontal cortex and the anterior insula in
   ASD. We discuss these findings in relation to possible abnormalities in
   a network of cortical and subcortical mechanisms involved in social
   orienting and emotion contagion. Our data suggest that emotion
   perception deficits in ASD may be due to compromised processing of the
   emotional component of observed actions.}},

Abstract = {{Despite increases in the human life span, people have not increased
   their rate of saving. In a phenomenon known as temporal discounting,
   people value immediate gains over future gains. According to a future
   self-continuity hypothesis, individuals perceive and treat the future
   self differently from the present self, and so might fail to save for
   their future. Neuroimaging offers a novel means of testing this
   hypothesis, since previous research indicates that self- vs
   other-judgments elicit activation in the rostral anterior cingulate
   (rACC). Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, we
   predicted and found not only individual differences in rACC activation
   while rating the current vs future self, but also that individual
   differences in current vs future self activation predicted temporal
   discounting assessed behaviorally a week after scanning. In addition to
   supporting the future self-continuity hypothesis, these findings hold
   implications for significant financial decisions, such as choosing
   whether to save for the future or spend in the present.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional statistical analysis methods for functional magnetic

   regions that are activated as a whole during specific mental activities.
   The overall activation of a region is usually taken to indicate
   involvement of the region in the task. However, such activation analysis
   does not consider the multivoxel patterns of activity within a brain
   region. These patterns of activity, which are thought to reflect
   neuronal population codes, can be investigated by pattern-information
   analysis. In this framework, a regions multivariate pattern information
   is taken to indicate representational content. This tutorial
   introduction motivates pattern-information analysis, explains its
   underlying assumptions, introduces the most widespread methods in an

Title = {{Activation of Anterior Insula during Self-Reflection}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Functional neuroimaging studies have suggested activation of
   midline frontoparietal brain regions to be at the core of self-related
   processes. However, although some studies reported involvement of the
   insula, little attention has been paid to this region as forming part of
   the ``self''-network.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI), we aimed at replicating and extending previous studies
   by scanning subjects whilst reflecting upon their own personal qualities
   as compared to those of an acquaintance. A third condition with
   statements about general knowledge was used to control for attention,
   semantic processing and decision making processes. The results showed a
   significant effect of task in brain activity, consistent with previous
   findings, by which both person conditions recruited a common set of
   medial prefrontal and posterior regions, yet significant differences
   between self and other were found in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC)
   and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Notably, significant neural
   activation in the left anterior insula was observed as uniquely
   associated with self-reflection.
   Conclusions/Significance: The results provide further evidence for the
   specific recruitment of anterior MPFC and ACC regions for self-related
   processing, and highlight a role for the insula in self-reflection. As
   the insula is closely connected with ascending internal body signals,
   this may indicate that the accumulation of changes in affective states
   that might be implied in self-processing may contribute to our sense of
   self.}},

Abstract = {{A widely observed phenomenon in decision making under risk is the
   apparent overweighting of unlikely events and the underweighting of
   nearly certain events. This violates standard assumptions in expected
   utility theory, which requires that expected utility be linear
   (objective) in probabilities. Models such as prospect theory have
   relaxed this assumption and introduced the notion of a ``probability
   weighting function,{''} which captures the key properties found in
   experimental data. This study reports functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) data that neural response to expected reward is nonlinear
   in probabilities. Specifically, we found that activity in the striatum
   during valuation of monetary gambles are nonlinear in probabilities in
   the pattern predicted by prospect theory, suggesting that probability
   distortion is reflected at the level of the reward encoding process. The
   degree of nonlinearity reflected in individual subjects' decisions is
   also correlated with striatal activity across subjects. Our results shed
   light on the neural mechanisms of reward processing, and have
   implications for future neuroscientific studies of decision making
   involving extreme tails of the distribution, where probability weighting
   provides an explanation for commonly observed behavioral anomalies.}},

Abstract = {{In economic decision making, outcomes are described in terms of risk (
   uncertain outcomes with certain probabilities) and ambiguity ( uncertain
   outcomes with uncertain probabilities). Humans are more averse to
   ambiguity than to risk, with a distinct neural system suggested as
   mediating this effect. However, there has been no clear disambiguation
   of activity related to decisions themselves from perceptual processing
   of ambiguity. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI)
   experiment, we contrasted ambiguity, defined as a lack of information
   about outcome probabilities, to risk, where outcome probabilities are
   known, or ignorance, where outcomes are completely unknown and
   unknowable. We modified previously learned pavlovian CS+ stimuli such
   that they became an ambiguous cue and contrasted evoked brain activity
   both with an unmodified predictive CS+( risky cue), and a cue that
   conveyed no information about outcome probabilities ( ignorance cue).
   Compared with risk, ambiguous cues elicited activity in posterior
   inferior frontal gyrus and posterior parietal cortex during outcome
   anticipation. Furthermore, a similar set of regions was activated when
   ambiguous cues were compared with ignorance cues. Thus, regions
   previously shown to be engaged by decisions about ambiguous rewarding
   outcomes are also engaged by ambiguous outcome prediction in the context
   of aversive outcomes. Moreover, activation in these regions was seen
   even when no actual decision is made. Our findings suggest that these
   regions subserve a general function of contextual analysis when search
   for hidden information during outcome anticipation is both necessary and
   meaningful.}},

Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{Across cultures, social relationships are often thought of, described,
   and acted out in terms of physical space (e.g. ``close friends'' ``high
   lord''). Does this cognitive mapping of social concepts arise from
   shared brain resources for processing social and physical relationships?
   Using fMRI, we found that the tasks of evaluating social compatibility
   and of evaluating physical distances engage a common brain substrate in
   the parietal cortex. The present study shows the possibility of an
   analytic brain mechanism to process and represent complex networks of
   social relationships. Given parietal cortex's known role in constructing
   egocentric maps of physical space, our present findings may help to
   explain the linguistic, psychological and behavioural links between
   social and physical space.}},

Abstract = {{It has been hypothesized that the right hemisphere of the brain is more
   sensitive to alcohol-related damage than the left hemisphere. The
   present Study tested this hypothesis, using functional MRI to determine
   whether the pattern for right hemispheric activity is different for
   alcohol-dependent patients, compared to normal healthy individuals. Two
   different types of memory encoding tasks were performed separately: word
   and face encoding for both alcohol-dependent patients and normal healthy
   volunteers. The data for the normal volunteers indicate that the left
   prefrontal region is more active during word encoding, whereas the right
   parahippocampal region is more active during face encoding. The results
   for the patient data, however, demonstrated left lateralization in the
   prefrontal area during word encoding, while right lateralization in the
   parahippocampal region during face encoding was not observed. Therefore,
   alcoholism appears to have no influence on left hemispheric activity,
   since the activation pattern was similar to that observed for normal
   healthy persons. However, the absence of right hemispheric
   lateralization in alcohol-dependent patients is consistent with the
   hypothesis that the right hemisphere is more vulnerable to
   alcohol-related damage than the left hemisphere. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Journal = {{BMC NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{FEB 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: The ability to mentalize, i.e. develop a Theory of Mind
   (ToM), enables us to anticipate and build a model of the thoughts,
   emotions and intentions of others. It has long been hypothesised that
   women differ from men in their mentalizing abilities. In the present
   fMRI study we examined the impact of (1) gender (women vs. men) and (2)
   game partner (human vs. computer) on ToM associated neural activity in
   the medial prefrontal cortex. Groups of men (n = 12) and women (n = 12)
   interacted in an iterated classical prisoner's dilemma forced choice
   situation with alleged human and computer partners who were outside the
   scanner.
   Results: Both the conditions of playing against putative human as well
   as computer partners led to activity increases in mPFC, ACC and rTPJ,
   constituting the classic ToM network. However, mPFC/ACC activity was
   more pronounced when participants believed they were playing against the
   alleged human partner. Differences in the medial frontal lobe activation
   related to the sex of the participants could be demonstrated for the
   human partner > computer partner contrast.
   Conclusion: Our data demonstrate differences in medial prefrontal brain
   activation during a ToM task depending on both the gender of
   participants and the game partner.}},

Abstract = {{Because youth with aggressive conduct disorder (CD) often inflict pain
   on others, it is important to determine if they exhibit atypical
   empathic responses to viewing others in pain. In this initial functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, eight adolescents with
   aggressive CD and eight matched controls with no CD symptoms were
   scanned while watching animated visual stimuli depicting other people
   experiencing pain or not experiencing pain. Furthermore, these
   situations involved either an individual whose pain was caused by
   accident or an individual whose pain was inflicted on purpose by another
   person. After scanning, participants rated how painful the situations
   were. In both groups the perception of others in pain was associated
   with activation of the pain matrix, including the ACC, insula,
   somatosensory cortex, supplementary motor area and periaqueductal gray.
   The pain matrix was activated to a specific extent in participants with
   CD, who also showed significantly greater amygdala, striatal, and
   temporal pole activation. When watching situations in which pain was
   intentionally inflicted, control youth exhibited signal increase in the
   medial prefrontal cortex, lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and right
   temporo-parietal junction, whereas youth with CD only exhibited
   activation in the insula and precentral gyrus. Furthermore, connectivity
   analyses demonstrated that youth with CD exhibited less
   amygdala/prefrontal coupling when watching pain inflicted by another
   than did control youth. These preliminary findings suggest that youth
   with aggressive CD exhibit an atypical pattern of neural response to
   viewing others in pain that should be explored in further studies. (C)

Abstract = {{Cognitive reserve (CR) defines the capacity of the adult brain to cope
   with pathology in order to minimize symptomatology. Relevant lifetime
   social, cognitive and leisure activities represent measurable proxies of
   cognitive CR but its underlying structural and functional brain
   mechanisms remain poorly understood. We investigated the relationship
   between CR and regional gray matter volumes and brain activity (fMRI)
   during a working memory task in a sample of healthy elders. Participants
   with higher CR had larger gray matter volumes in frontal and parietal
   regions. Conversely, a negative correlation was observed between CR and
   fMRI signal in the right inferior frontal cortex, suggesting increased
   neural efficiency for higher CR individuals. This latter association
   however disappeared after adjusting for gray matter images in a
   voxel-based manner. Altogether, present results may reflect both general
   and specific anatomofunctional correlates of CR in the healthy elders.
   Thus, whereas heteromodal anterior and posterior gray matter regions
   correspond to passive (i.e. morphological) correlates of CR unrelated to
   functional brain activation during this particular cognitive task, the
   right inferior frontal area reveals interactions between active and
   passive components of CR related to the cognitive functions tested in
   the fMRI study. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Social values are composed of social concepts (e.g., ``generosity{''})
   and context-dependent moral sentiments (e.g., ``pride{''}). The neural
   basis of this intricate cognitive architecture has not been investigated
   thus far. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging while
   subjects imagined their own actions toward another person (self-agency)
   which either conformed or were counter to a social value and were
   associated with pride or guilt, respectively. Imagined actions of
   another person toward the subjects (other-agency) in accordance with or
   counter to a value were associated with gratitude or indignation/anger.
   As hypothesized, superior anterior temporal lobe (aTL) activity
   increased with conceptual detail in all conditions. During self-agency,
   activity in the anterior ventromedial prefrontal cortex correlated with
   pride and guilt, whereas activity in the subgenual cingulate solely
   correlated with guilt. In contrast, indignation/anger activated lateral
   orbitofrontal-insular cortices. Pride and gratitude additionally evoked
   mesolimbic and basal forebrain activations. Our results demonstrate that
   social values emerge from coactivation of stable abstract social
   conceptual representations in the superior aTL and context-dependent
   moral sentiments encoded in fronto-mesolimbic regions. This neural
   architecture may provide the basis of our ability to communicate about
   the meaning of social values across cultural contexts without limiting
   our flexibility to adapt their emotional interpretation.}},

Abstract = {{Although research has shown that deficits in various cognitive functions
   may underlie obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), studies have not yet
   clarified the specificity and etiology of perception processing,
   particularly the perception of biological motion that is correlated with
   social cognition. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   to investigate neural activity associated with the perception of
   biological motion in OCD patients.
   The subjects were 15 patients with OCD and 15 age- and IQ-matched
   healthy volunteers. All subjects participated in a biological motion
   task in which they performed a one-back task signaling a repeated
   stimulus with a key press in each block condition to obligate attention
   to both types of stimuli.
   The biological motion versus scrambled motion contrast revealed that
   both OCD patients and healthy controls exhibited increased activation of
   the superior and middle temporal gyrus, the regions implicated in
   processing of biological motion, which is consistent with previous
   studies. However, direct comparison between OCD subjects and healthy
   controls indicated that patients with OCD exhibited increased activation
   in the right superior and middle temporal gyrus and the left inferior
   temporal and fusiform gyrus, and reduced activation in the right
   postcentral gyrus (BA 40) compared to healthy subjects. OCD patients
   exhibited increased activation in the ventral visual system, including
   the inferior temporal and fusiform gyrus.
   We observed a differential pattern of activity between OCD patients and
   healthy controls, indicating that OCD patients have functional
   differences related to the perception of biological motion. The
   differential activation between OCD patients and healthy subjects might
   contribute to the pathophysiological understanding of obsessive
   compulsive disorder.}},

Abstract = {{Our sense of self is strongly colored by emotions although at the same
   time we are well able to distinguish affect and self. Using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging, we here tested for the differential effects
   of self-relatedness and emotion dimensions (valence, intensity) on
   parametric modulation of neural activity during perception of emotional
   stimuli. We observed opposite parametric modulation of self-relatedness
   and emotion dimensions in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and the
   ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens, whereas neural activity in
   subcortical regions (tectum, right amygdala, hypothalamus) was modulated
   by self-relatedness and emotion dimensions in the same direction. In
   sum, our results demonstrate that self-relatedness is closely linked to
   emotion dimensions of valence and intensity in many lower subcortical
   brain regions involved in basic emotional systems and, at the same time,
   distinct from them in higher cortical regions that mediate cognitive
   processes necessary for becoming aware of one's self, for example

Abstract = {{Extrastriate, parietal, and frontal brain regions are differentially
   involved in distinct kinds of body movements and motor cognition. Using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the neural
   mechanisms underlying the observation and mental imagery of meaningful
   face and limb movements with or without objects. The Supplementary motor
   area was differentially recruited by the mental imagery of movements
   while there were differential responses of the extrastriate body area
   (EBA) during the observation conditions. Contrary to most previous
   reports, the EBA responded to face movements, albeit to a lesser degree
   than to limb movements. The medial wall of the intraparietal sulcus and
   adjacent intraparietal cortex was selectively recruited by the
   processing of meaningful upper limb movements, irrespective of whether
   these were object-related or not. Besides reach and grasp movements, the
   intraparietal sulcus may thus be involved in limb gesture processing,
   that is, in an important aspect of human social communication. We
   conclude that subregions of a frontal-parietal network differentially
   interact during the cognitive processing of body movements according to
   the specific motor-related task at hand and the particular movement
   features involved. Hum Brain Mapp 30:432-451, 2009. (C) 2007 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {{The default mode network (DMN), based in ventromedial prefrontal cortex
   (vMPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), exhibits higher metabolic
   activity at rest than during performance of externally oriented
   cognitive tasks. Recent studies have suggested that competitive
   relationships between the DMN and various task-positive networks
   involved in task performance are intrinsically represented in the brain
   in the form of strong negative correlations (anticorrelations) between
   spontaneous fluctuations in these networks. Most neuroimaging Studies
   characterize the DMN as a homogenous network, thus few have examined the
   differential contributions of DMN components to such competitive
   relationships. Here, we examined functional differentiation within the
   DMN, with an emphasis on understanding competitive relationships between
   this and other networks. We used a seed correlation approach on
   resting-state data to assess differences in functional connectivity
   between these two regions and their anticorrelated networks. While the
   positively correlated networks for the vmPFC and PCC seeds largely
   overlapped, the anticorrelated networks for each showed striking
   differences. Activity in vmPFC negatively predicted activity in parietal
   visual spatial and temporal attention networks, whereas activity in PCC
   negatively predicted activity in prefrontal-based motor control
   circuits. Granger causality analyses suggest that vmPFC and PCC exert
   greater influence on their anticorrelated networks than the other way
   around, suggesting that these two default mode nodes may directly
   modulate activity in task-positive networks. Thus, the two major nodes
   comprising the DMN are differentiated with respect to the specific brain
   systems with which they interact, suggesting greater heterogeneity
   within this network than is commonly appreciated. Hum Brain Mapp

Abstract = {{Neuropsychological and functional imaging studies have suggested a
   general right hemisphere advantage for processing global visual
   information and a left hemisphere advantage for processing local
   information. In contrast, a recent transcranial magnetic stimulation
   study {[}Mevorach, C., Humphreys, G. W., \& Shalev, L. Opposite biases
   in salience-based selection for the left and right posterior parietal
   cortex. Nature Neuroscience, 9, 740-742, 2006b] demonstrated that
   functional lateralization of selection in the parietal cortices on the
   basis of the relative salience of stimuli might provide an alternative
   explanation for previous results. In the present study, we applied a
   whole-brain analysis of the functional magnetic resonance signal when
   participants responded to either the local or the global levels of
   hierarchical figures. The task (respond to local or global) was crossed
   with the saliency of the target level (local salient, global salient) to
   provide, for the first time, a direct contrast between brain activation
   related to the stimulus level and that related to relative saliency. We
   found evidence for lateralization of salience-based selection but not
   for selection based on the level of processing. Activation along the
   left intraparietal sulcus (IPS) was found when a low saliency stimulus
   had to be selected irrespective of its level. A control task showed that
   this was not simply an effect of task difficulty. The data suggest a
   specific role for regions along the left IPS in salience-based
   selection, supporting the argument that previous reports of lateralized
   responses to local and global stimuli were contaminated by effects of
   saliency.}},

Abstract = {{The goal was to investigate whether patients with depression perform
   more poorly in overall emotion perception tasks compared with controls
   and whether this difference varies as a function of emotional intensity
   and arousal, with a perceptual bias toward high arousal emotions. Data
   were collected from 23 depressed and 23 control subjects, matched for
   gender, age, and education. Basic emotions were presented at 5 intensity
   levels ranging from 20\% to 100\%. Results showed that, relative to
   controls, patients with depression showed a significant impairment in
   the ability to recognize facial expressions, and that the impairment was
   most pronounced at subtle, but clearly recognizable emotional facial
   stimuli representing low arousal. Furthermore, depressed patients were
   found to make more misattribution errors of neutral and low arousal
   facial expressions in the direction of high arousal emotions. We
   conclude that the inability to accurately recognize nonemotional and
   emotional facial expressions along with the tendency for more
   attributions to the high arousal emotions can represent 2 basic
   contributing factors to the well-documented social problems of patients
   with depression.}},

Abstract = {{Graph theory allows us to quantify any complex system, e.g., in social
   sciences, biology or technology, that can be abstractly described as a
   set of nodes and links. Here we derived human brain functional networks
   from fMRI measurements of endogenous, low frequency, correlated
   oscillations in 90 cortical and subcortical regions for two groups of
   healthy (young and older) participants. We investigated the modular
   structure of these networks and tested the hypothesis that normal brain
   aging might be associated with changes in modularity of sparse networks.
   Newman's modularity metric was maximised and topological roles were
   assigned to brain regions depending on their specific contributions to
   intra-and inter-modular connectivity. Both young and older brain
   networks demonstrated significantly non-random modularity. The young
   brain network was decomposed into 3 major modules: central and posterior
   modules, which comprised mainly nodes with few inter-modular
   connections, and a dorsal fronto-cingulo-parietal module, which
   comprised mainly nodes with extensive inter-modular connections. The
   mean network in the older group also included posterior, superior
   central and dorsal fronto-striato-thalamic modules but the number of
   intermodular connections to frontal modular regions was significantly
   reduced, whereas the number of connector nodes in posterior and central
   modules was increased. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Anxiety predicts a differential neural response to attended and

Abstract = {{Behavioural evidence indicates that individual differences in anxiety
   influence the response to facial signals of threat. Angry and fearful
   faces represent qualitatively different forms of threat. Fearful faces
   are thought to signal the presence of a significant, yet undetermined
   source of danger within the environment, referred to as `ambiguous
   threat'. In contrast, angry faces represent a more direct form of
   threat, often used in face-to-face encounters to exert dominance. Given
   the inherent differences between anger and fear, we hypothesised that
   anxiety would modulate the amygdala response to angry faces to a greater
   extent when attended. Following previous research, we expected anxiety
   to show a stronger relationship with the amygdala response to unattended
   fearful faces. In an event-related fMRI study, we presented images of
   two houses and two faces (consisting of fearful, angry or neutral
   expressions) in horizontal and vertical pairs around a central fixation
   cross, with participants instructed to attend to either the face or
   house stimuli. The results showed that higher anxiety levels produced an
   increased right amygdala response to viewer directed angry facial
   expressions (versus neutral or fearful faces) only when attended. By
   contrast, increased anxiety was associated with a greater left amygdala
   response to fearful faces (versus neutral or angry faces) in the
   unattended condition, with only borderline evidence for attended fear
   (relative to neutral). Our findings demonstrate the striking effects of
   personality in a non-clinical population, and show how this can
   distinguish the neural coding of anger and fear faces. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An increasing body of evidence suggests that the nucleus accumbens

   responses to conditioned and unconditioned aversive stimuli. Yet, it has
   been argued that NAcc activation to aversive stimuli may be a
   consequence of the rewarding effects of their termination, i.e., relief.
   To address this question we used fMRI to delineate brain response to the
   onset and offset of unpleasant and pleasant auditory stimuli in the
   absence of learning or motor response. Increased NAcc activity was seen
   for the onset of both pleasant and unpleasant stimuli. Our results
   support the expanded bivalent view of NAcc function and call for
   expansion of current models of NAcc function that are solely focused on

Abstract = {{Recollecting autobiographical memories of personal past experiences is
   an integral part of our everyday lives and relies on a distributed set
   of brain regions. Their occurrence externally in the real world
   ('realness') and their self-relevance ('selfness') are two de. ning
   features of these autobiographical events. Distinguishing between
   personally experienced events and those that happened to other
   individuals, and between events that really occurred and those that were
   mere figments of the imagination, is clearly advantageous, yet the
   respective neural correlates remain unclear. Here we experimentally
   manipulated and dissociated realness and selfness during fMRI using a
   novel paradigm where participants recalled self (autobiographical) and
   non-self (from a movie or television news clips) events that were either
   real or previously imagined. Distinct sub-regions within dorsal and
   ventral medial prefrontal cortex, retrosplenial cortex and along the
   parieto-occipital sulcus preferentially coded for events (real or
   imagined) involving the self. By contrast, recollection of
   autobiographical events that really happened in the external world
   activated different areas within ventromedial prefrontal cortex and
   posterior cingulate cortex. In addition, recall of externally
   experienced real events (self or non-self) was associated with increased
   activity in areas of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and posterior
   cingulate cortex. Taken together our results permitted a functional
   deconstruction of anterior (medial prefrontal) and posterior
   (retrosplenial cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus) cortical
   midline regions widely associated with autobiographical memory but whose
   roles have hitherto been poorly understood. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The face-processing network has evolved to respond differentially to
   different classes of faces depending on their relevance to the
   perceiver. For example, self-, familiar, and unknown faces are
   associated with activation in different neural substrates. Family should
   represent a special class of face stimuli that is of high relevance to
   individuals, because incorrect assignment of kinship can have dire
   consequences (e.g., incest, cuckoldry). Therefore evolution should have
   favored redundant mechanisms for detection of kin. We used fMRI to
   investigate the neural substrates associated with viewing faces of kin
   compared to other classes of faces (e.g., self-face, familiar face, and
   unknown face), and to examine the degree to which self-facial
   resemblance activated similar neural substrates. Contrasting kin faces
   with unknown faces activated substrates associated with self-face
   recognition, while comparing kin faces to friend faces activated
   posterior cingulate and cuneus. Similar posterior medial substrates were
   recruited when contrasting self-resembling faces with morphed faces of
   kin, suggesting these regions potentially represent computational
   processing about facial familiarity and identity. On the other hand,
   discrimination of self-resembling faces from familiar morphs activated
   anterior medial substrates (anterior cingulate cortex, ACC, medial
   prefrontal cortex, MPFC). These findings, and a region of interest (ROI)
   analysis, highlight the role of the extended face-processing network for
   discrimination of kin from familiar non-kin members of one's social
   group based on self-referent phenotypic cues. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

   Neural correlates of variable working memory load across adult age and

   Scandinavian Journal of Psychology, 50, 41-46.
   We examined neural changes related to variations in working memory load
   by using an n-back task with three levels and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging. Younger adults were divided into high- and
   low-performing groups (Young-High; Young-Low) and compared with older
   adults. Relative to Young-High, capacity-constraints in working memory
   were apparent between load 1-2 for the elderly and between load 2-3 for
   Young-Low. Capacity-constraints in neural activity followed this pattern
   by showing a monotonically increasing response in parietal cortex and
   thalamus for Young-High, whereas activity leveled off at 1-back for the
   elderly and at 2-back for Young-Low. The response in dorsal frontal
   cortex followed a similar pattern with the addition that the magnitude
   of activation differed within capacity limitations (Old > Young at
   1-back; Young-Low > Young-High at 2-back). These findings indicate that
   an important determinant of WM capacity is the ability to keep the
   frontal cortex adequately engaged in relation to current task demands.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral data supports the commonsense view that babies elicit
   different responses than adults do. Behavioral research also has
   supported the babyface overgeneralization hypothesis that the adaptive
   value of responding appropriately to babies produces a tendency for
   these responses to be over-generalized to adults whose facial structure
   resembles babies. Here we show a neural substrate for responses to
   babies and babyface overgeneralization in the amygdala and the fusiform
   face area (FFA). Both regions showed greater percentage BOLD signal
   change compared with fixation when viewing faces of babies or babyfaced
   men than maturefaced men. Viewing the first two categories also yielded
   greater effective connectivity between the two regions. Facial qualities
   previously shown to elicit strong neural activation could not account
   for the effects. Babyfaced men were distinguished only by their
   resemblance to babies. The preparedness to respond to infantile facial
   qualities generalizes to babyfaced men in perceivers' neural responses
   just as it does in their behavioral reactions.}},

Abstract = {{Theories of empathy differ regarding the relative contributions of
   automatic resonance and perspective taking in understanding others'
   emotions. Patients with the rare syndrome of congenital insensitivity to
   pain cannot rely on ``mirror matching{''} (i.e., resonance) mechanisms

   responses to observed pain in anterior mid-cingulate cortex and anterior
   insula, two key regions of the so-called ``shared circuits{''} for self
   and other pain. In these patients (but not in healthy controls), empathy
   trait predicted ventromedial prefrontal responses to somatosensory
   representations of others' pain and posterior cingulate responses to
   emotional representations of others' pain. These findings underline the
   major role of midline structures in emotional perspective taking and
   understanding someone else's feeling despite the lack of any previous
   personal experience of it-an empathic challenge frequently raised during

Abstract = {{Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetic disorder caused by a hemizygous
   microdeletion on chromosome 7q11.23. WS is associated with a compelling
   neurocognitive profile characterized by relative deficits in
   visuospatial function, relative strengths in face and language
   processing, and enhanced drive toward social engagement. We used a
   combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related
   potential (ERP) approach to examine the neural basis of social
   responsiveness in WS participants to two types of social stimuli,
   negative (fearful) and positive (happy) emotional facial expressions.
   Here, we report a double dissociation consistent across both methods
   such that WS participants exhibited heightened amygdala reactivity to
   positive (happy) social stimuli and absent or attenuated amygdala
   reactivity to negative (fearful) social stimuli, compared with controls.
   The fMRI findings indicate that atypical social processing in WS may be
   rooted in altered development of disparate amygdalar nuclei that
   subserve different social functions. The ERP findings suggest that
   abnormal amygdala reactivity in WS may possibly function to increase
   attention to and encoding of happy expressions and to decrease arousal
   to fearful expressions. This study provides the first evidence that the
   genetic deletion associated with WS influences the function of the
   amygdala to be particularly responsive to socially appetitive stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{We often change our decisions and judgments to conform with normative
   group behavior. However, the neural mechanisms of social conformity
   remain unclear. Here we show, using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging, that conformity is based on mechanisms that comply with
   principles of reinforcement learning. We found that individual judgments
   of facial attractiveness are adjusted in line with group opinion.
   Conflict with group opinion triggered a neuronal response in the rostral
   cingulate zone and the ventral striatum similar to the ``prediction
   error{''} signal suggested by neuroscientific models of reinforcement
   learning. The amplitude of the conflict-related signal predicted
   subsequent conforming behavioral adjustments. Furthermore, the
   individual amplitude of the conflict-related signal in the ventral
   striatum correlated with differences in conforming behavior across
   subjects. These findings provide evidence that social group norms evoke
   conformity via learning mechanisms reflected in the activity of the
   rostral cingulate zone and ventral striatum.}},

Abstract = {{Women's sexual decision making is a complex process balancing the
   potential rewards of conception and pleasure against the risks of
   possible low paternal care or sexually transmitted infection. Although
   neural processes underlying social decision making are suggested to
   overlap with those involved in economic decision making, the neural
   systems associated with women's sexual decision making are unknown.
   Using fMRI, we measured the brain activation of 12 women while they
   viewed photos of men's faces. Face stimuli were accompanied by
   information regarding each man's potential risk as a sexual partner,
   indicated by a written description of the man's number of previous
   sexual partners and frequency of condom use. Participants were asked to
   evaluate how likely they would be to have sex with the man depicted.
   Women reported that they would be more likely to have sex with low
   compared to high risk men. Stimuli depicting low risk men also elicited
   stronger activation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), midbrain.
   and intraparietal sulcus, possibly reflecting an influence of sexual
   risk on women's attraction, arousal, and attention during their sexual
   decision making. Activation in the ACC was positively correlated with
   women's subjective evaluations of sex likelihood and response times
   during their evaluations of high, but not low risk men. These findings
   provide evidence that neural systems involved in sexual decision making
   in women overlap with those described previously to underlie nonsexual
   decision making. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Risk factors for delusion of theft in patients with Alzheimer's disease

Abstract = {{The mechanism underlying delusion in Alzheimer's disease patients has
   not been fully clarified; however, the occurrence of delusion is a
   critical issue for dementia patients and their caregivers. In Japan,
   delusion of theft is the most frequent delusion in AD patients. We
   examined the risk factors for delusion of theft in AD patients showing
   mild dementia. Fifty-six AD patients were administered HDS-R, MMSE and
   COGNISTAT, including the `speech sample', to assess their
   neuropsychological and social cognitive functions. The age, years of
   education, presence of cohabiting family members and premorbid
   personality traits were obtained from family members. About 25.0\% of AD
   patients showed delusion of theft (D-group), and 75\% did not
   (non-D-group). About 33.3\% of female patients and 5.9\% of male
   patients were included in the D-group (p 0.05). About 13.6\% of patients
   who were cohabiting with family members and 66.7\% of patients who were
   living alone were included in the D-group (p 0.05). About 35.1\% of
   patients who had a neurotic personality and 5.3\% of patients who did
   not were included in the D-group (p 0.05). There were no significant
   differences in scores on HDS-R, MMSE and COGNISTAT sub-scales, except
   for `speech sample', between the two groups. In the `speech sample',
   38.7\% of patients who understood a relationship between two boys and
   12.0\% of patients who did not were included in the D-group (p 0.05).
   These results indicated that delusion of theft in AD patients was
   related to female gender, absence of cohabiting family members, neurotic
   personality and retained social cognitive function.}},

Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE}},

Volume = {{35}},

Pages = {{284-289}},
Abstract = {{Background and Objectives: Habitual alcohol use is prodromal to alcohol
   dependence. It has been suggested that impairment in impulse control
   contributes to habitual drinking. Little is known whether neural
   processes associated with impulse control is altered in non-dependent
   social drinkers. The current preliminary study combined functional
   magnetic resonance imaging and the stop signal task (SST) to address
   this issue. Methods: We compared non-dependent non/light (n = 12) and
   moderate/heavy (n = 9) young adult alchol drinkers in a SST, in which
   they were required to exercise inhibitory control during the stop trials
   and were engaged in a speed/accuracy trade-off duing trial-to-trial go
   responses. Our previous studies identified neural correlates of
   inhibitory control and risk taking during the SST (10, 11). Furthermore,
   alcohol dependent patients showed altered brain activation both during
   inhibitory control and risk taking, compared to healhty controls (12).
   Results: We showed that moderate/heavy alcohol drinkers were decreased
   in amygdala activation during risk taking, while indistinguishable in
   neural measures of inhibitory control, when compared to non/light
   drinkers. Conclusions and Significance: Altered amygdala activation
   during risk taking may be a key neural process underlying early habitual
   alcohol use and a potential marker mediating transition to alcohol
   dependence.}},

Title = {{Disorder-Specific Dissociation of Orbitofrontal Dysfunction in Boys With

Abstract = {{Objective: Among children, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
   (ADHD) and conduct disorder are often comorbid and overlap clinically.
   Neuropsychological evidence suggests that children with conduct disorder
   demonstrate more prominent motivational problems and children with ADHD
   demonstrate more prominent attention deficits relative to healthy
   comparison subjects. The purpose of the present study was to investigate
   disorder-specific abnormalities in the neurobiological correlates of
   motivation and sustained attention in children and adolescents with pure
   conduct disorder and children and adolescents with pure ADHD.
   Method: Participants were male pediatric patients, ages 9-16 years, with
   noncomorbid conduct disorder (N=14) and noncomorbid ADHD, combined
   hyperactive-inattentive subtype (N=18), as well as age-and IQ-matched
   healthy comparison subjects (N=16). Both patient groups were medication
   naive. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was
   used to compare brain activation during a rewarded continuous
   performance task that measured sustained attention as well as the
   effects of reward on performance.
   Results: During the sustained attention condition, patients with
   noncomorbid ADHD showed significantly reduced activation in the
   bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and increased activation in
   the cerebellum relative to patients with noncomorbid conduct disorder
   and healthy comparison subjects. Patients with noncomorbid conduct
   disorder showed decreased activation in paralimbic regions of the
   insula, hippocampus, and anterior cingulate as well as the cerebellum
   relative to patients with noncomorbid ADHD and healthy comparison
   subjects. However, during the reward condition, patients with
   noncomorbid conduct disorder showed disorder-specific underactivation in
   the right orbitofrontal cortex, while patients with noncomorbid ADHD
   showed disorder-specific dysfunction in the posterior cingulate gyrus.
   Conclusions: The findings revealed a process-related dissociation of
   prefrontal dysfunction in ADHD and conduct disorder patients.
   Attention-related dysfunction in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex was
   seen in ADHD patients, and reward-related dysfunction in the
   orbitofrontal cortex was seen in conduct disorder patients. These
   findings, together with the pattern of paralimbic dysfunction
   demonstrated among children with conduct disorder during sustained
   attention, support theories of abnormalities in orbitofrontal-paralimbic
   motivation networks in individuals with conduct disorder and, in
   contrast, ventrolateral fronto-cerebellar attention network dysfunction
   in individuals with ADHD.}},

Abstract = {{Top-down control processes are thought to interact with bottom-up

   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we utilized a
   GO/NO-GO task with cued and uncued inhibitory events to investigate the
   effect of cue-induced levels of top-down control on NO-GO trial response
   conflict. We found that, on a within-subjects, trial-for-trial basis,
   high levels of top-down control, as indexed by left dorsolateral
   prefrontal activation prior to the NO-GO, resulted in lower levels of
   activation on the NO-GO trial in the pre-supplementary motor area. These
   results suggest that prefrontal and midline regions work together to
   implement cognitive control and reveal that intra-subject variability is
   reflected in these lateral and midline interactions.}},

Journal = {{EVOLUTION AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{30}},

Pages = {{1-10}},

Abstract = {{Women's preference for masculine faces varies with hormonal state,
   sociosexuality, and relationship status, but the underlying mechanisms
   are poorly understood. We hypothesized that hormones and psychosexual
   factors (sociosexuality, sexual inhibition/excitation) mediate the
   perception and evaluation of male faces thereby influencing women's
   preferences. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure
   brain activity in 12 women as they evaluated pictures of male faces
   (half 30\% masculinized, half 30\% feminized). Participants were
   heterosexual women, age 23-28 years, who were not in a committed
   relationship and not using hormonal contraception. Women were tested
   during both the follicular and luteal phase of their menstrual cycle. We
   found five brain regions related to face and risk processing that
   responded more to the masculinized than to the feminized faces,
   including the superior temporal gyrus, precentral gyrus, posterior
   cingulate cortex, inferior parietal lobule, and anterior cingulate
   cortex. Increased activation in the anterior cingulate cortex,
   specifically, may indicate that women perceive masculinized faces to be
   both more risky and more attractive. We did not see any areas that were
   more strongly activated by feminized faces. Levels of activation were
   influenced by hormonal and psychosexual factors. The patterns of
   hormonally and psychosexually mediated neural activation observed may
   offer insight into the cognitive processes underlying women's partner
   preferences. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{534-544}},
Abstract = {{Fearful faces are important social cues that alert others of potential
   threat. Even backward masked fearful faces facilitate spatial attention.
   However, visual stimuli other than fearful faces can signal potential
   threat. Indeed, unmasked snakes and spiders modulate spatial attention.
   Yet, it is unclear if the rapid threat-related facilitation of spatial
   attention to backward masked stimuli is elicited by non-face threat
   cues. Evolutionary theories claim that phylogenetic threats (i.e. snakes
   and spiders) should preferentially elicit an automatic fear response,
   but it is untested as to whether this response extends to enhancements
   in spatial attention under restricted processing conditions. Thirty
   individuals completed a backward masking dot-probe task with both
   evolutionary relevant and irrelevant threat cues. The results suggest
   that backward masked visual fear stimuli modulate spatial attention.
   Both evolutionary relevant (snake) and irrelevant (gun) threat cues
   facilitated spatial attention.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Understanding changes in attitudes towards others is critical to
   understanding human behaviour. Neuropolitical studies have found that
   the activation of emotion-related areas in the brain is linked to
   resilient political preferences, and neuroeconomic research has analysed
   the neural correlates of social preferences that favour or oppose
   consideration of intrinsic rewards. This study aims to identify the
   neural correlates in the prefrontal cortices of changes in political
   attitudes toward others that are linked to social cognition. Functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments have presented videos from
   previous electoral campaigns and television commercials for major cola
   brands and then used the subjects' self-rated affinity toward political
   candidates as behavioural indicators. After viewing negative campaign
   videos, subjects showing stronger fMRI activation in the dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex lowered their ratings of the candidate they originally
   supported more than did those with smaller fMRI signal changes in the
   same region. Subjects showing stronger activation in the medial
   prefrontal cortex tended to increase their ratings more than did those
   with less activation. The same regions were not activated by viewing
   negative advertisements for cola. Correlations between the self-rated
   values and the neural signal changes underscore the metric
   representation of observed decisions (i.e., whether to support or not)
   in the brain. This indicates that neurometric analysis may contribute to
   the exploration of the neural correlates of daily social behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) has been shown to be involved
   in attending different states, all including a strong emotional
   component. It remains unclear, though, whether neural activity in the
   DMPFC is predominantly determined by either a particular domain, as
   emotional stimuli, or by a specific process, as attention. Here, we used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging to test the alternative hypotheses
   of domain- versus process-specificity in DMPFC. Subjects had to perceive
   pictures from three: different domains, sexual, emotional, and neutral
   stimuli, in both a nonattended, i.e., unexpected, and attended, i.e.,
   expected mode. Our results show DMPFC activation during attended, i.e.,
   expected stimulus perception when compared with nonattended, i.e.,
   unexpected stimuli perception. DMPFC activation and corresponding
   behavioral changes (reaction time, subjective ratings) were observed in
   all three domains, sexual, emotional, and neutral stimuli. As opposed to
   those process-specific effects that were found predominantly in
   posterior DMPFC, a process by domain interaction was found to be
   characteristic for more anterior parts of the DMPFC. Taken together, our
   findings favour the hypothesis that neural activity in the posterior
   DMPFC is determined by a specific process, i.e., attending stimuli, and
   thus characterized by process-specificity rather than by a particular
   domain, i.e., sexual, emotional, or neutral stimuli, reflecting
   domain-specificity. This suggests that the anterior and posterior DMPFC
   is involved in the process of attending mental states while remaining
   more (posterior DMPFC) or less (anterior DMPFC) independent of the type
   or domain of the respective stimulus. Hung Brain Mapp 30:312-326, 2009.

Abstract = {{Objective: Aspergers Syndrome can present as comorbid with

   is started with methylphenidate (MPH), and the patient's clinical
   response is observed, psychological tests concerning attention are
   analyzed, and a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) examination
   is performed during an attention-task. Results: On the functional
   magnetic resonance imaging, a reduction of cerebral activity bilaterally

Abstract = {{Early prefrontal cortex damage has been associated with developmental
   deficits in social adaptation, moral behavior, and empathy that alter
   the maturation of social cognition and social emotions. The seminal case
   of Ackerly and Benton (1948) continues to provide the most striking
   clinical example of prefrontal-related neurodevelopmental impairments,
   with more recent case reports confirming and elaborating these
   influential observations. This study investigated the prefrontal
   hypothesis of moral decision making in healthy, typically developing
   children and adolescents (10-17 years of age) using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants judged the actions in
   age-appropriate moral vignettes as right or wrong, and results were
   contrasted to a nonsocial/nonmoral baseline condition requiring similar
   right versus wrong judgments. Results confirmed a predominant cluster of
   activity in the most rostral-medial (frontal polar) prefrontal region
   across moral judgment conditions, along with left lateroposterior
   orbitofrontal/ventrolateral prefrontal, left temporoparietal junction,
   midline thalamus and globus pallidus, and bilateral inferior occipital
   clusters. Trials entailing ambiguous moral situations activated
   considerably more prefrontal and parietal regions than did routine moral
   situations, suggesting the need for more neurocognitive resources. While
   age regression analysis identified a few regions of greater or lesser
   activity with age, the frontal polar activations did not change with
   age. Findings confirm a significant role for anterior-medial prefrontal
   cortex in the typical development and maturation of moral decision
   making, consistent with clinical lesion case descriptions.}},

   13 male matched controls during viewing of 4 types of visual stimuli:
   neutral. positive affect, aggressive-threat. and aggression against
   women. The study was conducted from September 2005 to August 2006.
   Results: Compared to controls, batterers showed significantly higher

Abstract = {{Prior research has shown that perceived social isolation (loneliness)
   motivates people to attend to and connect with others but to do so in a
   self-protective and paradoxically self-defeating fashion. Although
   recent research has shed light on the neural correlates of social
   perception, cooperation, empathy, rejection, and love, little is known
   about how individual differences in loneliness relate to neural
   responses to social and emotional stimuli. Using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging, we show that there are at least two neural mechanisms
   differentiating social perception in lonely and nonlonely young adults.
   For pleasant depictions, lonely individuals appear to be less rewarded
   by social stimuli, as evidenced by weaker activation of the ventral
   striatum to pictures of people than of objects, whereas nonlonely
   individuals showed stronger activation of the ventral striatum to
   pictures of people than of objects. For unpleasant depictions, lonely
   individuals were characterized by greater activation of the visual
   cortex to pictures of people than of objects, suggesting that their
   attention is drawn more to the distress of others, whereas nonlonely
   individuals showed greater activation of the right and left
   temporo-parietal junction to pictures of people than of objects,
   consistent with the notion that they are more likely to reflect
   spontaneously on the perspective of distressed others.}},

Title = {{Flawless visual short-term memory for facial emotional expressions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VISION}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Facial emotions are important cues of human social interactions.
   Emotional expressions are continuously changing and thus should be
   monitored, memorized, and compared from time to time during social
   intercourse. However, it is not known how efficiently emotional
   expressions can be stored in short-term memory. Here we show that
   emotion discrimination is not impaired when the faces to be compared are
   separated by several seconds, requiring storage of fine-grained
   emotion-related information in short-term memory. Likewise, we found no
   significant effect of increasing the delay between the sample and the
   test face in the case of facial identity discrimination. Furthermore, a
   second experiment conducted on a large subject sample (N = 160) revealed
   flawless short-term memory for both facial emotions and facial identity
   also when observers performed the discrimination tasks only twice with
   novel faces. We also performed an fMRI experiment, which confirmed that
   discrimination of fine-grained emotional expressions in our experimental
   paradigm involved processing of high-level facial emotional attributes.
   Significantly stronger fMRI responses were found in a cortical
   network-including the posterior superior temporal sulcus-that is known
   to be involved in processing of facial emotional expression during
   emotion discrimination than during identity discrimination. These
   findings reveal flawless, high-resolution visual short-term memory for
   emotional expressions, which might underlie efficient monitoring of
   continuously changing facial emotions.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: This study examined the roles of the insula and the anterior
   cingulate activations in the rejection of unfair offers in the impunity
   game.
   METHODS: Fifteen participants played the impunity game in ten trials as
   responders during neuroimaging.
   RESULTS: About 45\% of the unfair offers were rejected by the responders
   even when responders could not restore a fair outcome, which cannot be
   accounted for by social preference of inequity aversion. Imaging data
   showed that the right anterior insula was activated when participants
   faced and rejected unfair offers.
   CONCLUSIONS: The insula activation during a rejection of the unfair
   offers is the reflection of an emotional response, rather than social
   preference of inequity aversion. The role of emotion in the
   neuroeconomics of fairness was demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{On the basis of Hamilton's (Hamilton, W. D. (1964). The genetical
   evolution of social behavior I, II. Journal of Theoretical Biology, 7,
   17-52) theory of inclusive fitness, self-facial resemblance is
   hypothesized as a mechanism for self-referent phenotypic matching by
   which humans can detect kin. To understand the mechanisms underlying
   pro-sociality toward self-resembling faces, we investigated the neural
   correlates of implicit trustworthiness ratings for self-resembling
   faces. Here we show that idiosyncratic trustworthiness ratings of
   self-resembling faces predict brain activation in the ventral inferior,
   middle and medial frontal gyri, substrates involved in reward
   processing. These findings demonstrate that neural reward centers are
   implicated in evaluating implicit pro-social behaviors toward
   self-resembling faces. These findings suggest that humans have evolved
   to use neurocomputational architecture dedicated to face processing and
   reward evaluation for the differentiation of kin, which drives implicit
   idiosyncratic affectively regulated social interactions. (C) 2008

   while they compared social status magnitude of people, objects and

   semantic distance effect whereby neural activity within bilateral

Abstract = {{Emotion discrimination deficits represent a well-established finding in
   schizophrenia. Although imaging studies addressed the cerebral
   dysfunctions underlying emotion perception in adult patients, the
   question of trait vs state characteristics is still unresolved. The
   investigation of juvenile patients offers the advantage of studying
   schizophrenia at an age where influences of illness course and long-term
   medication are minimized. This may enable a more detailed
   characterization of emotion discrimination impairments and their
   cerebral correlates with respect to their appearance and exact nature. A
   total of 12 juvenile patients with early onset schizophrenia and matched
   healthy juveniles participated in this study. fMRI data were acquired
   during an emotion discrimination task consisting of standardized
   photographs of faces displaying happy, sad, angry, fearful, or neutral
   facial expression. Similar to findings in adult patients, juvenile
   patients exhibited reduced performance specificity whereas sensitivity
   was unaffected. Independent of the valence, their processing of
   emotional faces was associated with hypoactivations in both fusiform
   gyri and in the left inferior occipital gyrus. In addition,
   hyperactivations in patients were found in the right cuneus common to
   happy, angry, and fearful faces. Further, most distinct changes were
   present in juvenile patients when processing sad faces. These results
   point to a dysfunction in cerebral circuits relevant for emotion
   processing already prominent in adolescent schizophrenia patients.
   Regions affected by a decrease in activation are related to visual and
   face processing, similar to deficits reported in adult patients. These
   changes are accompanied by hyperactivations in areas related to emotion
   regulation and attribution, possibly reflecting compensatory mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Lie judgment is an estimation of the speaker's intention to deceive
   inevitably accompanied by moral judgment. To depict their neural
   substrates, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging study.
   Eighteen subjects read short stories and made judgments in three
   different tasks: a control gender judgment task, a moral judgment task,
   and a lie judgment task. Compared with the control task, both the moral
   and lie judgment tasks activated the left temporal lobe, the medial
   prefrontal cortex, the lateral orbitofrontal cortex extending to the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the caudate nucleus, the left
   temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), and the right cerebellum. Neural
   activations were greater in the left middle frontal gyrus, the bilateral
   TPJ, and the right superior temporal sulcus in the lie judgment
   condition than in the moral judgment condition. In addition, the left
   TPJ showed greater activation when a protagonist told lies for
   anti-social rather than pro-social purposes. These data suggest that the
   judgment of lies is mediated by the neural substrates of moral judgment
   (conventionality) and those involved in detecting the intent to deceive
   (intentionality), and that the left TPJ might play a key role in
   processing both the conventional and the intentional information
   involved in the judgment of lying. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the

Abstract = {{An extended body of behavioral work has described the auditory skills of
   infants, but the neural basis of these skills has remained largely
   unexplored. Recently, noninvasive brain imaging techniques, such as
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have been successfully used from the
   first hours after birth, providing informative data on auditory
   processing and its anatomic underpinnings. The goal of this paper is to
   examine this increasing body of data, focusing on a basic aspect of
   auditory processing that has attracted considerable attention and is
   starting to be elucidated: the hemispheric specialization for the
   processing of complex auditory stimuli. We will briefly discuss the
   peculiarities of MRI techniques applied to the infant brain, and review
   the anatomic and functional evidence for the existence and weighting of
   hemispheric asymmetry for auditory processing in infancy.}},

Abstract = {{During the last years, a number of studies demonstrated that music
   listening (and even more so music production) activates a multitude of
   brain structures involved in cognitive, sensorimotor, and emotional
   processing. For example, music engages sensory processes, attention,
   memory-related processes, perception-action mediation ({''}mirror neuron
   system{''} activity), multisensory integration, activity changes in core
   areas of emotional processing, processing of musical syntax and musical
   meaning, and social cognition. It is likely that the engagement of these
   processes by music can have beneficial effects on the psychological and
   physiological health of individuals, although the mechanisms underlying
   such effects are currently not well understood. This article gives a
   brief overview of factors contributing to the effects of
   music-therapeutic work. Then, neuroscientific studies using music to
   investigate emotion, perception-action mediation ({''}mirror
   function{''}), and social cognition are reviewed, including
   illustrations of the relevance of these domains for music therapy.}},

Pages = {{573-595}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates a special kind of social meaning-making manifest
   in how we experience static objects and properties of our everyday
   world. This happens, for example, when we recognize objects like vacuum
   cleaners, sliced tomatoes, and sneakers as placed in special sites in
   the environment. Given the compositional features of such images, we see
   them as designed to accomplish communicative functions. It is argued
   that object configurations of this kind are recognized as externalized
   ostensive cues. They are seen as having been created with the intention
   of setting off an intersubjective mode of perception. This significantly
   changes the perceiver's semiotic exploration of the scene. From a
   `private' mode of sense-making mostly structured by reference to
   episodic, autobiographical experiential content, the perceiver takes a
   language stance. In other words, the perceiver adopts a qualitatively
   different meaning-constructing strategy in dealing with such images.
   Defending this claim, we present evidence from an empirical
   investigation of 20 participants' construals of photographic images
   depicting everyday static objects. We show that a subset of these object
   configurations (signals) evoke a special kind of socially responsive
   attitude as manifested in participants' introspective reports. The
   importance of these findings is brought out by discussion of parallels
   in neuro-cognitive work and how ostensive cues influence infant
   behavior.}},

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{27}},

Pages = {{405-419}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Several recent studies show that training can improve working
   memory (WM) performance. In this review, many issues related to WM
   training, such as neural basis, transfer effects, and age-related
   changes are addressed.
   Method: We focus on our own studies investigating training on tasks
   taxing the executive updating function and discuss our findings in
   relation to results from other studies investigating training of the
   executive component of WM.
   Results: The review confirms positive behavioral effects of training on
   working memory. The most common neural pattern following training is
   fronto-parietal activity decreases. Increases in sub-cortical areas are
   also frequently reported after training, and we suggest that such
   increases indicate changes in the underlying skill following training.
   Transfer effects are in general difficult to demonstrate. Some studies
   show that older adults increase their performance after WM training.
   However, transfer effects are small or nonexistent in old age.
   Conclusions: The main finding in this review is that sub-cortical areas
   seem to have a critical role in mediating transfer effects to untrained
   tasks after at least some forms of working memory training (such as
   updating).}},

Abstract = {{The neurobiological mechanisms of Total Sleep Deprivation (TSD) -
   induced changes in executive control function were investigated.
   Fourteen participants were measured by functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) with the visual Go/No-go task after normal sleep and
   following 36 hours of TSD. The TSD-induced positive and negative blood
   oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals compared with that after a
   normal night's sleep (NORM). The areas activated with positive BOLD
   signals include the superior prefrontal cortex and inferior prefrontal
   cortex, with negative BOLD signals in the anterior cingulated cortex
   (ACC) and right lingual gyrus. Increased activation may be related to
   the compensatory response since more attention resources are needed to
   perform the Go/No-go task after 36 hours of TSD and the decreased
   activation in the ACC may reflect the impact of executive control
   function by the TSD.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies provide support for the role of the fusiform gyrus in face
   recognition and its sensitivity to emotional expressions. Recently,
   category-specific representation was also observed for neutral human
   bodies in the middle temporal/middle occipital gyrus (extrastriate body
   area) but it is not clear whether this area is also sensitive to
   emotional bodily expressions. Besides these areas, other regions that
   process the affective information carried by the face and the body may
   be common and/or specific to the face or the body. To clarify these
   issues we performed a systematic comparison of how the whole brain
   processes faces and bodies and how their affective information is
   represented. Participants categorized emotional facial and bodily
   expressions while brain activity was measured using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging. Our results show that, first, the amygdala and the
   fusiform gyrus are sensitive to recognition of facial and bodily fear
   signals. Secondly, the extrastriate body area-area V5/MT is specifically
   involved in processing bodies without being sensitive to the emotion
   displayed. Thirdly, other important areas such as the superior temporal
   sulcus, the parietal lobe and subcortical structures represent
   selectively facial and bodily expressions. Finally, some face/body
   differences in activation are a function of the emotion expressed.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the temporal dynamics of brain function contributes to
   models of learning and memory as well as the processing of emotions and
   habituation. In this article, we present a novel analysis technique to
   investigate spatiotemporal patterns of activation in response to blocked
   presentations of emotional stimuli. We modeled three temporal response
   functions (TRFs), which were maximally sensitive to the onset, early or
   sustained temporal component of a given block type. This analysis
   technique was applied to a data set of 29 subjects who underwent
   functional magnetic resonance imaging while responding to fearful,
   happy, and sad facial expressions. We identified brain regions that
   uniquely fit each of the three TRFs for each emotional condition and
   compared the results to the standard approach, which was based on the
   canonical hemodynamic response function. We found that voxels within the
   precuneus fit the onset TRF but did not fit the early or the sustained
   TRF in all the emotional conditions. On the other hand, voxels within
   the amygdala fit the sustained TRF, but not the onset or early TRF,
   during presentation of fearful stimuli, suggesting a spatiotemporal
   dissociation between these structures. This technique provides
   researchers with an additional tool in order to investigate the temporal

Abstract = {{This study used fMRI to investigate the functioning of the Theory of
   Mind (ToM) cortical network in autism during the viewing of animations
   that in some conditions entailed the attribution of a mental state to
   animated geometric figures. At the cortical level, mentalizing
   (attribution of metal states) is underpinned by the coordination and
   integration of the components of the ToM network, which include the
   medial frontal gyrus, the anterior paracingulate, and the right
   temporoparietal junction. The pivotal new finding was a functional
   underconnectivity (a lower degree of synchronization) in autism,
   especially in the connections between frontal and posterior areas during
   the attribution of mental states. In addition, the frontal ToM regions
   activated less in participants with autism relative to control
   participants. In the autism group, an independent psychometric
   assessment of ToM ability and the activation in the right
   temporoparietal junction were reliably correlated. The results together
   provide new evidence for the biological basis of atypical processing of
   ToM in autism, implicating the underconnectivity between frontal regions
   and more posterior areas.}},

Abstract = {{Emotion research is guided both by the view that emotions are points in
   a dimensional space, such as valence or approach-withdrawal, and by the
   view that emotions are discrete categories. We determined whether
   effective connectivity of amygdala with medial orbitofrontal cortex

   perception of emotion faces in a manner consistent with the dimensional
   and/or categorical view. Greater effective connectivity from left MOFC
   to amygdala differentiated positive and neutral expressions from
   negatively valenced angry, disgust, and fear expressions. Greater
   effective connectivity from right LOFC to amygdala differentiated
   emotion expressions conducive to perceiver approach (happy, neutral, and
   fear) from angry expressions that elicit perceiver withdrawal. Finally,
   consistent with the categorical view, there were unique patterns of
   connectivity in response to fear, anger, and disgust, although not in
   response to happy expressions, which did not differ from neutral ones.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{197-211}},
Abstract = {{Recent neuroimaging work has observed activity in cortical midline
   structures (CMS) such as medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate
   cortices during self-referential processing. Moreover, items rated as
   self-relevant produce increased activity in these regions relative to
   items that are deemed not self-relevant. A common thread among previous
   reports has been reliance on experimental tasks that encourage or
   require online self-referential processing. In this paper, we report
   findings from two experiments that manipulated requirements for
   self-reflection. In Experiment 1, subjects rated trait adjectives for
   social desirability and for self-relevance. Results revealed increasing
   activity in CMS with increasing self-relevance, but only during explicit
   ratings of self-relevance. In Experiment 2, we examined CMS activity
   during passive viewing of personal semantic facts (such as subjects' own
   first names). Taken together, these results suggest that highly
   self-relevant information captures attention through neural mechanisms
   that are comparable to those engaged during explicit self-reflection,
   namely via recruitment of CMS structures.}},

   salience}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{233-243}},
Abstract = {{Covert exchange of autonomic responses may shape social affective
   behavior, as observed in mirroring of pupillary responses during sadness
   processing. We examined how, independent of facial emotional expression,
   dynamic coherence between one's own and another's pupil size modulates
   regional brain activity. Fourteen subjects viewed pairs of eye stimuli
   while undergoing fMRI. Using continuous pupillometry biofeedback, the
   size of the observed pupils was varied, correlating positively or
   negatively with changes in participants' own pupils. Viewing both static
   and dynamic stimuli activated right fusiform gyrus. Observing
   dynamically changing pupils activated STS and amygdala, regions engaged
   by non-static and salient facial features. Discordance between observed
   and observer's pupillary changes enhanced activity within bilateral
   anterior insula, left amygdala and anterior cingulate. In contrast,
   processing positively correlated pupils enhanced activity within left
   frontal operculum. Our findings suggest pupillary signals are monitored
   continuously during social interactions and that incongruent changes
   activate brain regions involved in tracking motivational salience and
   attentionally meaningful information. Naturalistically, dynamic
   coherence in pupillary change follows fluctuations in ambient light.
   Correspondingly, in social contexts discordant pupil response is likely
   to reflect divergence of dispositional state. Our data provide empirical
   evidence for an autonomically mediated extension of forward models of
   motor control into social interaction.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Pages = {{244-260}},
Abstract = {{Our identity consists of knowledge about our individual attributes
   (personal identity) as well as knowledge about our shared attributes
   derived from our membership in certain social groups (social identity).
   As individuals seek to achieve a positive self-image, they aim at
   comparing favorably with other individuals or their in-group comparing
   favorably with referent out-groups. Imaging data suggest a network
   centered on the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) to instantiate functions
   that are integral to the self, conceived as the personal self. Given
   that the social self is constituted by the same mechanisms as the
   personal self, we expect MPFC activation also for situations in which
   the social self is addressed, for instance when situations permit
   evaluative intergroup comparisons. Accordingly, participants worked on a
   modified version of the minimal group paradigm in the present functional
   magnetic resonance imaging experiment. Imaging data revealed activation
   within a network centered on the dorsal MPFC specifically for social
   identity processes. Furthermore, this activation showed correlation with
   the displayed in-group bias. The present findings show that social and
   personal identity processes draw on the same cerebral correlates and
   hence it is concluded that a network centered on the MPFC subserves
   functions integral to the self.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{294-307}},
Abstract = {{Cultural differences in emotion recognition performance have frequently
   been reported, whereby duration of stay in a foreign culture seems to be
   a crucial factor. Furthermore, cultural aspects influence the neural
   correlates of face and emotion processing thereby also affecting the
   response of the amygdala. Here, the exposure to a foreign culture and
   its influence on the cerebral correlates of facial emotion recognition
   were examined in 24 Asian and 24 age-matched European males. Subjects
   performed an explicit emotion recognition task and were imaged with a 3
   T MR-scanner. Results demonstrate a significant cultural influence on
   the specific recognition of disgust and anger, with higher accuracy
   among the Europeans, while the functional data indicate generally
   elevated amygdala activation in Asians compared to Europeans. Moreover,
   a significant inverse correlation between duration of stay and amygdala
   response emerged, with stronger activation in those subjects with
   shorter duration of stay in Europe. The observed amygdala
   hyperactivation in Asians may reflect novelty aspects but might also be
   associated with greater effort and motivation in immigrants, thus it
   possibly reflects one neural correlate of the oalien-effecto. We
   conclude that exposure to a foreign culture and duration of stay affect
   the behavioral and neural response to facial expressions of emotions.}},

Pages = {{367-383}},
Abstract = {{Politics is a manifestation of the uniquely human ability to debate,
   decide, and reach consensus on decisions affecting large groups over
   long durations of time. Recent neuroimaging studies on politics have
   focused on the association between brain regions and specific political
   behaviors by adopting party or ideological affiliation as a criterion to
   classify either experimental stimuli or subjects. However, it is
   unlikely that complex political beliefs (i.e., othe government should
   protect freedom of speecho) are evaluated only on a
   liberal-to-conservative criterion. Here we used multidimensional scaling
   and parametric functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify which
   criteria/dimensions people use to structure complex political beliefs
   and which brain regions are concurrently activated. We found that three
   independent dimensions explained the variability of a set of statements
   expressing political beliefs and that each dimension was reflected in a
   distinctive pattern of neural activation: individualism (medial
   prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal junction), conservatism
   (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), and radicalism (ventral striatum and
   posterior cingulate). The structures we identified are also known to be
   important in self-other processing, social decision-making in ambivalent
   situations, and reward prediction. Our results extend current knowledge
   on the neural correlates of the structure of political beliefs, a
   fundamental aspect of the human ability to coalesce into social
   entities.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{384-401}},
Abstract = {{Every day we encounter new people, interact with them, and form person
   impressions based on quick and automatic inferences from minimal
   contextual information. Previous studies have identified an extensive
   network of brain areas involved in familiar face recognition, but there
   is little evidence to date concerning the neural bases of negative vs.
   positive person impressions. In the present study, participants were
   repeatedly exposed to 16 unfamiliar face identities within a
   pseudo-interactive game context to generate a perception of either
   ofriendso or ofoeso. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was
   then performed during an old/new memory task to assess any difference in
   brain responses to these now familiar face identities, relative to
   unfamiliar faces. Importantly, whereas facial expressions were always
   emotional (either smiling or angry) during the encoding phase, they were
   always neutral during the memory task. Our results reveal that several
   brain regions involved in familiar face recognition, including fusiform
   cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus, and amygdala, plus additional areas
   involved in motivational control such as caudate and anterior cingulate
   cortex, were differentially modulated as a function of a previous
   encounter, and generally more activated when faces were perceived as
   ofoeso rather than ofriendso. These findings underscore that a key
   dimension of social judgments, based on past impressions of who may be
   supportive or hostile, may lead to long-lasting effects on memory for
   faces and thus influence affective reactions to people during a
   subsequent encounter even in a different (neutral) context.}},

Title = {{Neural correlates of reflection on goal states: The role of regulatory
   focus and temporal distance}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{412-425}},
Abstract = {{Effective self-regulation requires the ability to consider alternate
   goal states in order to adapt to shifting circumstances. Previous
   research on goal reflection has identified goal-type dissociations in
   brain regions broadly associated with self-projection. Importantly,
   however, there is a need to distinguish activation differences due to
   recruitment of distinct processes from activations that reflect common
   processes with varying levels of recruitment. The fact that different
   types of goals tend to covary naturally with time allowed us to vary the
   difficulty of goal reflection across content domains. Participants in an
   fMRI study thought about promotion or prevention goals at three time
   points. Goals that varied in terms of content, time-frame, valence, and
   abstractness but were difficult to construct (relative to other goals)
   activated an area of dorsal medial PFC, suggesting that this region may
   support general-purpose projective processes. In contrast, goals that
   were easy to construct activated a region of dorsolateral PFC involved
   in domain-general memory retrieval. Importantly, we also observed
   domain-specific effects of goal type and temporal distance; promotion
   goals were associated with heightened activity in medial PFC, short-term
   goals activated precuneus and anterior cingulate cortex, and longer-term
   goals activated frontal areas, including ventrolateral PFC and
   orbitofrontal cortex.}},

Title = {{The relation between race-related implicit associations and

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},

Pages = {{426-442}},
Abstract = {{The neural correlates of the perception of faces from different races
   were investigated. White participants performed a gender identification
   task in which Asian, Black, and White faces were presented while
   event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. Participants also
   completed an implicit association task for Black (IAT-Black) and Asian
   (IAT-Asian) faces. ERPs evoked by Black and White faces differed, with
   Black faces evoking a larger positive ERP that peaked at 168 ms over the
   frontal scalp, and White faces evoking a larger negative ERP that peaked
   at 244 ms. These Black/White ERP differences significantly correlated
   with participants' scores on the IAT-Black. ERPs also differentiated
   White from Asian faces and a significant correlation was obtained
   between the White-Asian ERP difference waves at similar to 500 ms and
   the IAT-Asian. A positive ERP at 116 ms over occipital scalp
   differentiated all three races, but was not correlated with either IAT.
   In addition, a late positive component (around 592 ms) was greater for
   the same race compared to either other race faces, suggesting
   potentially more extended or deeper processing of the same race faces.
   Taken together, the ERP/IAT correlations observed for both other races
   indicate the influence of a race-sensitive evaluative process that may
   include early more automatic and/or implicit processes and relatively
   later more controlled processes.}},

Title = {{Decreased ventral anterior cingulate cortex activity is associated with
   reduced social pain during emotional support}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{443-454}},
Abstract = {{People feel psychological pain when they are excluded, and this pain is
   often attenuated when emotional support is received. It is therefore
   likely that a specific neural mechanism underlies the detection of
   social exclusion. Similarly, specific neural mechanisms may underlie the
   beneficial effects of emotional support. Although neuroimaging
   researchers have recently examined the neural basis of social pain,
   there is presently no agreement as to which part of the anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC) is involved in the perception and modulation of
   social pain. We hypothesized that activity in those brain regions that
   are associated with social pain would be correlated with decrements in
   social pain induced by emotional support. To examine the effects of
   emotional support on social pain caused by exclusion, we conducted an
   fMRI study in which participants played a virtual ball-tossing game.
   Participants were initially included and later excluded from the game.
   In the latter half of the session from which participants were excluded,
   participants received emotionally supportive text messages. We found
   that emotional support led to increased activity in the left
   lateral/medial prefrontal cortices and some temporal regions. Those
   individuals who experienced greater attenuation of social pain exhibited
   lower ventral ACC and higher left lateral prefrontal cortex activation.
   These results suggest that the ventral ACC underlies social pain, and
   that emotional support enhances prefrontal cortex activity, which in
   turn may lead to a weakened affective response.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{4}},

Pages = {{455-463}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, several neuroimaging studies have suggested that the
   neural basis of the self-referential process1 is special, especially in
   the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). However, it remains controversial
   whether activity of the MPFC (and other related brain regions) appears
   only during the self-referential process. We investigated the neural
   correlates during the processing of references to the self, close other
   (friend), and distant other (prime minister) using fMRI. In comparison
   with baseline findings, referential processing to the three kinds of
   persons defined above showed common activation patterns in the
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), left middle temporal gyrus, left
   angular gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex and right cerebellum.
   Additionally, percent changes in BOLD signal in five regions of interest
   demonstrated the same findings. The result indicated that DMPFC was not
   special for the self-referential process, while there are common neural
   bases for evaluating the personalities of the self and others.}},

Abstract = {{Observation of changes in autonomic arousal was one of the first
   methodologies used to detect deception. Electrodermal activity (EDA) is
   a peripheral measure of autonomic arousal and one of the primary
   channels used in polygraph exams. In an attempt to develop a more
   central measure to identify lies, the use of functional magnetic
   resonance inaging (fMRI) to detect deception is being investigated. We
   wondered if adding EDA to our fMRI analysis would improve our diagnostic
   ability. For our approach, however, adding EDA did not improve the
   accuracy in a laboratory-based deception task. In testing for brain
   regions that replicated as correlates of EDA, we did find significant
   associations in right orbitofrontal and bilateral anterior cingulate
   regions. Further work is required to test whether EDA improves accuracy

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{518-527}},
Abstract = {{Recent reports of successful fMRI-based discrimination between lie and
   truth in single subjects raised the interest of prospective users and a
   public concern about the potential scope of this technology. The
   increased scrutiny highlighted the lack of controlled oreal lifeo, i.e.
   prospective clinical trials of this technology that conform to the
   common standards of medical device development. The ethics of conducting
   such trials given the paucity of data on fMRI-based lie detection has
   also been questioned. To probe the potential issues of translating the
   laboratory research into practice, we conducted a case study in which we
   adapted the standard Guilty Knowledge Test (GKT), a well-established
   model of producing deception, to the common scenario of lying on a
   resume. The task consisted of questions about pertinent items on the
   subject's resume, three of which could be independently verified as
   truth (KNOWN) and three that could not be verified and were thus termed
   UNKNOWN. The subject had an incentive to lie on all UNKNOWN items, and
   on debriefing confirmed that he had done so. Data was preprocessed,
   masked with a priori regions of interest, thresholded, and qualitatively
   evaluated for consistency with the previously reported
   prefronto-parietal Lie Truth pattern. Deceptive responses to two out of
   the three UNKNOWN items were associated with the predicted
   prefronto-parietal fMRI pattern. In the third UNKNOWN this pattern was
   absent, and instead, increased limbic (amygdala and hippocampus)
   response was observed. Based on published prefronto-parietal Lie
   response pattern, only the first two items could be categorized as Lie.
   If confirmed, this demonstration of amygdala and hippocampus activation
   in a Lie Truth contrast illustrates the need to integrate the limbic
   system and its emotional and cognitive correlates into the existing
   model of deception. Our experiment suggests an approach to a
   naturalistic scenario and the research questions that need to be
   answered in order to set the stage for prospective clinical trials of
   fMRI-based lie detection.}},

Abstract = {{Functional brain imaging has been considered a new and better technique
   for the detection of deception. The reasoning is that there is a neural
   locus or circuit for lying that is sensitive, specific, generalizable
   across individuals and measurement contexts, and robust to
   countermeasures. To determine the extent to which the group results
   predicted lying at the level of the individual, we reanalyzed data on 14
   participants from a study that had previously identified regions
   involved in lying (thus satisfying the criterion for sensitivity). We
   assessed the efficacy of functionally determined brain regions based on
   the lie-truth contrast for N - 1 participants to detect deception in the
   Nth individual. Results showed that no region could be used to correctly
   detect deception across all individuals. The best results were obtained
   for medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), correctly identifying 71\% of
   participants as lying with no false alarms. Lowering the threshold for a
   response increased hits and false alarms. The results suggest that
   although brain imaging is a more direct index of cognition than the
   traditional polygraph, it is subject to many of the same caveats and
   thus neuroimaging does not appear to reveal processes that are
   necessarily unique to deception.}},

Pages = {{539-553}},
Abstract = {{Two hypotheses were tested using a novel individual differences
   approach, which identifies rate-limiting brain regions, that is, brain
   regions in which variations in neural activity predict variations in
   behavioral performance. The first hypothesis is that the rate-limiting
   regions that support the production of lies about oneself (self-related)
   are partially distinct from those underlying the production of lies
   about other individuals (other-related). The second hypothesis is that a
   cingulate-insular-prefrontal network found to be rate-limiting for
   interference tasks is involved in both types of lies. The results
   confirmed both hypotheses and supported the utility of this individual
   differences approach in the study of deception in particular, as well in
   the study of complex cognitive phenomena more generally.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{554-569}},
Abstract = {{The two studies reported in this article are an extension of the
   neuroimaging study by Ganis et al. (2003), which provided evidence that
   different types of lies arise from different cognitive processes. We
   examined the initial response times (IRTs) to questions answered both
   deceptively and truthfully. We considered four types of deceptive
   responses: a coherent set of rehearsed, memorized lies about a life
   experience; a coherent set of lies spontaneously created about a life
   experience; a set of isolated lies involving self-knowledge; and a set
   of isolated lies involving knowledge of another person. We assessed the
   difference between truthful and deceptive IRTs. Scores from cognitive
   tasks included in the MiniCog Rapid Assessment Battery (MRAB) were
   significant predictors of IRT differences. Each type of lie was
   predicted by a distinct set of MRAB scores. These results provide
   further evidence that deception is a multifaceted process and that
   different kinds of lies arise from the operation of different cognitive
   processes.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{570-574}},
Abstract = {{Although a number of recent neuroimaging studies have examined the
   relationship between the brain and deception, the neurological
   correlates of deception are still not well understood. The present study
   sought to assess differences in cortical excitability during the act of
   deception by measuring motor evoked potentials (MEPs) during
   transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Sports fanatics and
   low-affiliation sports fans were presented with preferred and rival team
   images and were asked to deceptively or honestly identify their favored
   team. Hemispheric differences were found including greater excitability
   of the left motor cortex during the generation of deceptive responses.
   In contrast to current physiological measures of deception, level of
   arousal was not found to differentiate truthful and deceptive responses.
   The results are presented in terms of a complex cognitive pattern
   contributing to the generation of deceptive responses.}},

Journal = {{VISUAL COGNITION}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{6-7}},
Pages = {{1083-1108}},
Abstract = {{Inhibition of Return (IOR) is a delay in initiating attentional shifts
   to previously attended locations. It is believed to facilitate
   attentional exploration of a scene. Computational models of attention
   have implemented IOR as a simple mechanism for driving attention through
   a scene. However, evidence for IOR during scene viewing is inconclusive.
   In this study IOR during scene memorization and in response to sudden
   onsets at the last (1-back) and penultimate (2-back) fixation location
   was measured. The results indicate that there is a tendency for saccades
   to continue the trajectory of the last saccade (Saccadic Momentum), but
   contrary to the oforaging facilitatoro hypothesis of IOR, there is also
   a distinct population of saccades directed back to the last fixation
   location, especially in response to onsets. Voluntary return saccades to
   the 1-back location experience temporal delay but this does not affect
   their likelihood of occurrence. No localized temporal delay is exhibited
   at 2-back. These results suggest that IOR exists at the last fixation
   location during scene memorization but that this temporal delay is
   overridden by Facilitation of Return. Computational models of attention
   will fail to capture the pattern of saccadic eye movements during scene
   viewing unless they model the dynamics of visual encoding and can
   account for the interaction between Facilitation of Return, Saccadic
   Momentum, and Inhibition of Return.}},

Abstract = {{The phenomenon of empathy entails the ability to share the affective
   experiences of others. In recent years social neuroscience made
   considerable progress in revealing the mechanisms that enable a person
   to feel what another is feeling. The present review provides an in-depth
   and critical discussion of these findings. Consistent evidence shows
   that sharing the emotions of others is associated with activation in
   neural structures that are also active during the first-hand experience
   of that emotion. Part of the neural activation shared between self- and
   other-related experiences seems to be rather automatically activated.
   However, recent studies also show that empathy is a highly flexible
   phenomenon, and that vicarious responses are malleable with respect to a
   number of factors-such as contextual appraisal, the interpersonal
   relationship between empathizer and other, or the perspective adopted
   during observation of the other. Future investigations are needed to
   provide more detailed insights into these factors and,their neural
   underpinnings. Questions such as whether individual differences in
   empathy can be explained by stable personality traits, whether we can
   train ourselves to be more empathic, and how empathy relates to
   prosocial behavior are of utmost relevance for both science and society.}},
