abstract = "Behavioral research has revealed deficits in the development of joint attention (JA) as one of the earliest signs of autism. While the neural basis of JA has been studied predominantly in adults, we recently demonstrated a protracted development of the brain networks supporting JA in typically developing children and adolescents. The present eye-tracking/fMRI study now extends these findings to adolescents with autism. Our results show that in adolescents with autism JA is subserved by abnormal activation patterns in brain areas related to social cognition abnormalities which are at the core of ASD including the STS and TPJ, despite behavioral maturation with no behavioral differences. Furthermore, in the autism group we observed increased neural activity in a network of social and emotional processing areas during interactions with their mother. Moreover, data indicated that less severely affected individuals with autism showed higher frontal activation associated with self-initiated interactions. Taken together, this study provides first-time data of JA in children/adolescents with autism incorporating the interactive character of JA, its reciprocity and motivational aspects. The observed functional differences in adolescents ASD suggest that persistent developmental differences in the neural processes underlying JA contribute to social interaction difficulties in ASD."

abstract = "In spoken language, verbal cues (what we say) and vocal cues (how we say it) contribute to person perception, the process for interpreting information and making inferences about other people. When someone has an accent, forming impressions from the speaker's voice may be influenced by social categorization processes (i.e., activating stereotypical traits of members of a perceived ‘out-group’) and by processes which differentiate the speaker based on their individual attributes (e.g., registering the vocal confidence level of the speaker in order to make a trust decision). The neural systems for using vocal cues that refer to the speaker's identity and to qualities of their vocal expression to generate inferences about others are not known. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how speaker categorization influences brain activity as Canadian-English listeners judged whether they believe statements produced by in-group (native) and out-group (regional, foreign) speakers. Each statement was expressed in a confident, doubtful, and neutral tone of voice. In-group speakers were perceived as more believable than speakers with out-group accents overall, confirming social categorization of speakers based on their accent. Superior parietal and middle temporal regions were uniquely activated when listening to out-group compared to in-group speakers suggesting that they may be involved in extracting the attributes of speaker believability from the lower-level acoustic variations. Basal ganglia, left cuneus and right fusiform gyrus were activated by confident expressions produced by out-group speakers. These regions appear to participate in abstracting more ambiguous believability attributes from accented speakers (where a conflict arises between the tendency to disbelieve an out-group speaker and the tendency to believe a confident voice). For out-group speakers, stronger impressions of believability selectively modulated activity in the bilateral superior and middle temporal regions. Moreover, the right superior temporal gyrus, a region that was associated with perceived speaker confidence, was found to be functionally connected to the left lingual gyrus and right middle temporal gyrus when out-group speakers were judged as more believable. These findings suggest that identity-related voice characteristics and associated biases may influence underlying neural activities for making social attributions about out-group speakers, affecting decisions about believability and trust. Specifically, inferences about out-group speakers seem to be mediated to a greater extent by stimulus-related features (i.e., vocal confidence cues) than for in-group speakers. Our approach highlights how the voice can be studied to advance models of person perception."

Flexible goal choice and pursuit are not exclusively conscious, and therefore cognitive flexibility involves both explicit and implicit forms of processing. However, it is unclear how individual differences in explicit and implicit aspects of flexibility are associated with neural activity in a resting state. Here, we measured intrinsic fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) as an indicator of regional brain spontaneous activity, together with explicit and implicit aspects of cognitive flexibility using the Cognitive Flexibility Scale (CFS) and Implicit Association Test (IAT). Consistent with the dual processing theory, there was a strong association between explicit aspects of flexibility (CFS score) and “rationalism” thinking style and between implicit aspects (IAT effect) and “experientialism.” The level of explicit flexibility was also correlated with fALFF values in the left lateral prefrontal cortex, whereas the level of implicit flexibility was correlated with fALFF values in the right cerebellum. Furthermore, the fALFF values in both regions predicted individual preference for flexible decision-making strategy in a vignettes simulation task. These results add to our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying flexible decision-making for solving social conflicts. More generally, our findings highlight the utility of RS-fMRI combined with both explicit and implicit psychometric measures for better understanding individual differences in social cognition."

Yet, a fuller understanding of the mechanisms that support mental functions necessitates the characterization of dynamic properties. Here, we describe an approach employing a class of recurrent neural networks called reservoir computing, and show the feasibility and potential of using it for the analysis of temporal properties of brain data. We show that reservoirs can be used effectively both for condition classification and for characterizing lower-dimensional “trajectories” of temporal data. Classification accuracy was approximately 90% for short clips of “social interactions” and around 70% for clips extracted from movie segments. Data representations with 12 or fewer dimensions (from an original space with over 300) attained classification accuracy within 5% of the full data. We hypothesize that such low-dimensional trajectories may provide “signatures” that can be associated with tasks and/or mental states. The approach was applied across participants (that is, training in one set of participants, and testing in a separate group), showing that representations generalized well to unseen participants. Taken together, we believe the present approach provides a promising framework to characterize dynamic fMRI information during both tasks and naturalistic conditions."

All primates communicate. To dissect the neural circuits of social communication, we used fMRI to map non-human primate brain regions for social perception, second-person (interactive) social cognition, and orofacial movement generation. Face perception, second-person cognition, and face motor networks were largely non-overlapping and acted as distinct functional units rather than an integrated feedforward-processing pipeline. Whereas second-person context selectively engaged a region of medial prefrontal cortex, production of orofacial movements recruited distributed subcortical and cortical areas in medial and lateral frontal and insular cortex. These areas exhibited some specialization, but not dissociation, of function along the medio-lateral axis. Production of lipsmack movements recruited areas including putative homologs of Broca’s area. These findings provide a new view of the neural architecture for social communication and suggest expressive orofacial movements generated by lateral premotor cortex as a putative evolutionary precursor to human speech."

While negatively biased perception is thought to maintain social anxiety, emotion regulation represents an ability necessary to overcome both biased perception and social anxiety. Here, we used laughter as a social threat in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study to identify cerebral mediators linking SAD with attention and interpretation biases and their modification through cognitive emotion regulation in the form of reappraisal. We found that reappraisal abolished the negative laughter interpretation bias in SAD and that this process was directly mediated through activation patterns of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) serving as a cerebral pivot between biased social perception and its normalization through reappraisal. Connectivity analyses revealed reduced prefrontal control over threat-processing sensory cortices (here: the temporal voice area) during cognitive emotion regulation in SAD. Our results indicate a central role for the left DLPFC in SAD which might represent a valuable target for future research on interventions either aiming to directly modulate cognitive emotion regulation in SAD or to evaluate its potential as physiological marker for psychotherapeutic interventions relying on emotion regulation."

Here, using a combination of model-based fMRI and third party punishment games, we show that brain regions previously implicated in egocentric norm enforcement critically extend to the important case of norm enforcement by unaffected third parties. Specifically, we found that responses in the ACC and insula cortex were positively associated with detection of distributional inequity, while those in the anterior DLPFC were associated with assessment of intentionality to the violator. Moreover, during sanction decisions, the subjective value of sanctions modulated activity in both vmPFC and rTPJ. These results shed light on the neurocomputational underpinnings of third party punishment and evolutionary origin of human norm enforcement."

Here, we present novel techniques for the use of awake functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) — an important step forward in minimally-invasive measurement of neural activity in a non-traditional animal model. Imaging neural responses in prairie voles, a species studied for its propensity to form strong and selective social bonds, is expected to greatly advance our mechanistic understanding of complex social and affective processes. The use of ultra-high-field fMRI allows for recording changes in region-specific activity throughout the entire brain simultaneously and with high temporal and spatial resolutions. By imaging neural responses in awake animals, with minimal invasiveness, we are able to avoid the confound of anesthesia, broaden the scope of possible stimuli, and potentially make use of repeated scans from the same animals. These methods are made possible by the development of an annotated and segmented 3D vole brain atlas and software for image analysis. The use of these methods in the prairie vole provides an opportunity to broaden neuroscientific investigation of behavior via a comparative approach, which highlights the ethological relevance of pro-social behaviors shared between voles and humans, such as communal breeding, selective social bonds, social buffering of stress, and caregiving behaviors. Results using these methods show that fMRI in the prairie vole is capable of yielding robust blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal changes in response to hypercapnic challenge (inhaled 5% CO2), region-specific physical challenge (unilateral whisker stimulation), and presentation of a set of novel odors. Complementary analyses of repeated restraint sessions in the imaging hardware suggest that voles do not require acclimation to this procedure. Taken together, awake vole fMRI represents a new arena of neurobiological study outside the realm of traditional rodent models."

Here we examine the locus, specificity, and neural basis of the social control of imitation. Social cues (group membership and eye gaze) were manipulated during an imitation task in which imitative and spatial compatibility could be measured independently. Participants were faster to perform compatible compared to incompatible movements in both spatial and imitative domains. However, only spatial compatibility was modulated by social cues: an interaction between group membership and eye gaze revealed more spatial compatibility for ingroup members with direct gaze and outgroup members with averted gaze. The fMRI data were consistent with this finding. Regions associated with the control of imitative responding (temporoparietal junction, inferior frontal gyrus) were more active during imitatively incompatible compared to imitatively compatible trials. However, this activity was not modulated by social cues. On the contrary, an interaction between group, gaze and spatial compatibility was found in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in a pattern consistent with reaction times. This region may be exerting control over the motor system to modulate response inhibition."

The investigation of those systems seems essential to better understand opioid addiction as a whole. 17 patients on opioid maintenance treatment (OMT) and 21 healthy individuals underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) social ball-tossing (Cyberball) paradigm simulating social inclusion and exclusion. In addition, painful and non-painful temperature stimuli were applied, in order to test pain sensitivity. Patients on OMT showed reduced pain sensitivity. Subjective pain was higher after social exclusion compared to social inclusion trials. In comparison to healthy controls, OMT patients felt less included and more excluded during inclusion and control conditions, and equally excluded during the social exclusion condition. Feelings of exclusion during the inclusion trials were associated with higher scores on the childhood trauma questionnaire. Across all conditions, OMT patients demonstrated decreased fMRI activation in the bilateral superior and middle occipital and bilateral cunei, the lingual gyri, as well as in the left fusiform gyrus (whole brain FWE-corrected). Comparing social exclusion and inclusion conditions, healthy individuals showed significant activation in brain areas related to social feedback and emotion processing, such as the anterior cingulate cortex, the insula and fusiform gyrus, whereas OMT patients showed no difference across conditions. As negative social affect is a potential trigger for relapse, patients might benefit from therapeutic strategies that enhance social integration."

In the present study, we investigated how behavioral and neural representations of other social pain are modulated by the degree of sexual objectification of the target.

At the brain level, empathy for social exclusion of personalized women recruited areas coding the affective component of pain (i.e., anterior insula and cingulate cortex), the somatosensory components of pain (i.e., posterior insula and secondary somatosensory cortex) together with the mentalizing network (i.e., middle frontal cortex) to a greater extent than for the sexually objectified women. This diminished empathy is discussed in light of the gender-based violence that is afflicting the modern society."

Subjects completed the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) and the Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation (BFNE) to assess social anxiety and thoughts in social contexts. We also obtained the fractional Amplitude of Low Frequency Fluctuations (fALFF) of the BOLD signal as an independent control measure for HE data. BFNE scores correlated positively with HE in the posterior cingulate/precuneus, while LSAS scores correlated positively with HE in the precuneus, in the inferior parietal sulci and in the parahippocamus. Results from fALFF were highly consistent with those obtained using LSAS and BFNE to predict HE. Overall our data indicate that spontaneous brain activity is influenced by the degree of social anxiety, on a continuum and in the absence of social stimuli. These findings suggest that social anxiety is a trait characteristic that shapes brain activity and predisposes to different reactions in social contexts."

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) resting-state studies show generalized social anxiety disorder (gSAD) is associated with disturbances in networks involved in emotion regulation, emotion processing, and perceptual functions, suggesting a network framework is integral to elucidating the pathophysiology of gSAD. However, fMRI does not measure the fast dynamic interconnections of functional networks. Therefore, we examined whole-brain functional connectomics with electroencephalogram (EEG) during resting-state.
Methods
Resting-state EEG data was recorded for 32 patients with gSAD and 32 demographically-matched healthy controls (HC). Sensor-level connectivity analysis was applied on EEG data by using Weighted Phase Lag Index (WPLI) and graph analysis based on WPLI was used to determine clustering coefficient and characteristic path length to estimate local integration and global segregation of networks.
Results
WPLI results showed increased oscillatory midline coherence in the theta frequency band indicating higher connectivity in the gSAD relative to HC group during rest. Additionally, WPLI values positively correlated with state anxiety levels within the gSAD group but not the HC group. Our graph theory based connectomics analysis demonstrated increased clustering coefficient and decreased characteristic path length in theta-based whole brain functional organization in subjects with gSAD compared to HC.
Conclusions
Theta-dependent interconnectivity was associated with state anxiety in gSAD and an increase in information processing efficiency in gSAD (compared to controls). Results may represent enhanced baseline self-focused attention, which is consistent with cognitive models of gSAD and fMRI studies implicating emotion dysregulation and disturbances in task negative networks (e.g., default mode network) in gSAD."

Neurons within fMRI-defined face patches of the macaque brain exhibit shared categorical responses to flashed images but diverge in their responses under more natural viewing conditions. Here we investigate functional diversity among neurons in the anterior fundus (AF) face patch, combining whole-brain fMRI with longitudinal single-unit recordings in a local population (<1 mm3). For each cell, we computed a whole-brain correlation map based on its shared time course with voxels throughout the brain during naturalistic movie viewing. Based on this mapping, neighboring neurons showed markedly different affiliation with distant visually responsive areas and fell coarsely into subpopulations. Of these, only one subpopulation (∼16% of neurons) yielded similar correlation maps to the local fMRI signal. The results employ the readout of large-scale fMRI networks and, by indicating multiple functional domains within a single voxel, present a new view of functional diversity within a local neural population."

Here we extend experimental paradigms previously restricted to de novo decision-to-trust, to a more realistic environment in which social relationships evolve in response to iterative feedback over twenty interactions. In a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled within-subject/crossover experiment of human adult males, we investigated the effects of a single dose of intranasal OT (40 IU) on Bayesian expectation updating and reinforcement learning within a social context, with associated brain circuit dynamics. Subjects participated in a neuroeconomic task (Iterative Trust Game) designed to probe iterative social learning while their brains were scanned using ultra-high field (7T) fMRI. We modeled each subject's behavior using Bayesian updating of belief-states (“willingness to trust”) as well as canonical measures of reinforcement learning (learning rate, inverse temperature). Behavioral trajectories were then used as regressors within fMRI activation and connectivity analyses to identify corresponding brain network functionality affected by OT. Behaviorally, OT reduced feedback learning, without bias with respect to positive versus negative reward. Neurobiologically, reduced learning under OT was associated with muted communication between three key nodes within the reward circuit: the orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, and lateral (limbic) habenula. Our data suggest that OT, rather than inspiring feelings of generosity, instead attenuates the brain's encoding of prediction error and therefore its ability to modulate pre-existing beliefs. This effect may underlie OT's putative role in promoting what has typically been reported as ‘unjustified trust’ in the face of information that suggests likely betrayal, while also resolving apparent contradictions with regard to OT's context-dependent behavioral effects."

However, when measured at the macro scale using resting state fMRI, these alterations are subtle and often difficult to detect due to the large heterogeneity of the pathology. Recently, we outlined a novel approach for generating robust biomarkers of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) using connectivity based parcellation of gross morphological structures to improve single-subject reproducibility and generate more robust connectivity fingerprints. Here we apply this novel approach to investigating the organization and connectivity strength of the cortico-striatal system in a large sample of ASD individuals and typically developed (TD) controls (N=130 per group). Our results showed differences in the parcellation of the striatum in ASD. Specifically, the putamen was found to be one single structure in ASD, whereas this was split into anterior and posterior segments in an age, IQ, and head movement matched TD group. An analysis of the connectivity fingerprints revealed that the group differences in clustering were driven by differential connectivity between striatum and the supplementary motor area, posterior cingulate cortex, and posterior insula. Our approach for analysing RS-fMRI in clinical populations has provided clear evidence that cortico-striatal circuits are organized differently in ASD. Based on previous task-based segmentations of the striatum, we believe that the anterior putamen cluster present in TD, but not in ASD, likely contributes to social and language processes."

While this local bias is helpful in visual search tasks, ASD individuals falter in social cognition tasks where coherence is advantageous. The present study examined the neural correlates of Weak Central Coherence in ASD during visual and social processing. Fifteen ASD and sixteen typically developing children/adolescents completed a social/visual information processing task in an fMRI scanner. The stimuli consisted of human characters, composed of geometrical shapes, displaying different emotions. In the locally oriented Shape condition, participants indicated whether a given shape was present in a figure. In the Emotion condition, participants identified the emotion conveyed by the character in the figure at the global level. Whole-brain within- and between-group activation and seed-to-voxel functional connectivity analyses were conducted in SPM12 and the CONN toolbox. The ASD group was significantly faster in shape identification, but less accurate in emotion identification. The TD group showed significantly increased areas of activity over the ASD group in the Shape task in regions associated with executive control, such as the medial prefrontal cortex and middle frontal gyrus, suggesting increased interference from the global/social information. During the Emotion condition, the ASD group showed decreased connectivity between frontal and posterior regions and between body perception and motor networks, suggesting a possible difference in mirroring. The findings suggest that social cognitive factors, not visual processing biases, underlie the observed behavioral differences."

For example, scenes that emphasize characters’ thoughts evoke activity in the “Theory of Mind” (ToM) network, whereas scenes that emphasize characters’ bodily sensations evoke activity in the “Pain Matrix.” A prior exploratory fMRI study used a naturalistic movie-viewing stimulus to study the developmental origins of this functional dissociation, and the links between cortical and cognitive changes in children’s social development (Richardson et al., 2018). To replicate and extend this work, the current study utilized a large publicly available dataset (n = 241, ages 5–20 years) (Alexander et al., 2017) who viewed “The Present” (Frey, 2014) and completed a resting state scan (n = 200) while undergoing fMRI. This study provides confirmatory evidence that 1) ToM and pain networks are functionally dissociated early in development, 2) selectivity increases with age, and in ToM regions, with a behavioral index of social reasoning. Additionally, while inter-region correlations are similar when measured during the movie and at rest, only inter-region correlations measured during movie-viewing correlated with functional maturity. This study demonstrates the scientific benefits of open source data in developmental cognitive neuroscience, and provides insight into the relationship between functional and intrinsic properties of the developing brain."

Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging in 14 patients with SAD, as compared to 12 healthy controls, we found that amygdala hyper-reactivity is confined to disorder-relevant social stimulation. SAD patients displayed increased amygdala reactivity to fearful as compared to neutral facial pictures, but not in response to generally aversive but mainly non-social stimulation when compared to neutral pictorial stimuli taken from the International Affective Picture System. The increased amygdala reactivity was not mediated by an altered prefrontal inhibition among SAD patients as compared to controls, suggesting increased bottom-up processes rather than attenuated top-down control. In conclusion, the enhanced amygdala reactivity in SAD seems specific to socially relevant stimuli rather than aversive stimuli in general."

Participants viewed animations of geometric shapes depicting either random movement or social interactions such as playing, chasing, or fighting. Probe questions asked whether any shapes were “friends” or “not friends.” Social videos were preceded by cues to attend to either social relationships or physical size changes. All subjects received intranasal placebo spray at scan 1. While the experimenter was not blinded to nasal spray contents at Scan 1, the participants were. Scan 2 followed a randomized, double-blind design. At scan 2, half received a second placebo dose while the other half received 24 IU of intranasal oxytocin. We measured neural responses to these animations at baseline, as well as the change in neural activity induced by oxytocin. Oxytocin reduced activation in early visual cortex and dorsal-stream motion processing regions for the social > size contrast, indicating reduced activity related to social attention. Oxytocin also reduced endorsements that shapes were “friends” or “not friends,” and this significantly correlated with reduction in neural activation. Furthermore, participants who perceived fewer social relationships at baseline were more likely to show oxytocin-induced increases in a broad network of regions involved in social perception and social cognition, suggesting that lower social processing at baseline may predict more positive neural responses to oxytocin."

The changes in DC in the precuneus were positively correlated with changes in clinical symptom. The abnormal ALFF of the precuneus, MTG and lingual gyrus may be the neural underpinning of GSAD, whereas the neural response to symptom remission after GCBT was achieved by a rebalance within the default mode network."

abstract = "Background
Chronic opioid misuse is associated with reduced sensitivity to natural rewards and social motivation deficits that include impaired caregiving. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying these deficits and their response to treatment are not well understood. Baby schema (Kindchenschema) is a set of juvenile physical features, which is perceived as “cute” and triggers motivation for caregiving. Recent studies suggest that the “baby schema effect” is mediated by the brain “reward” network. We studied the impact of opioid antagonist treatment on the baby schema response in patients with opioid use disorder.
Methods
Forty-seven (24 F) recently detoxified patients with opioid use disorder underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while viewing infant portraits that were parametrically manipulated for baby schema content and rating them for cuteness, at baseline and during treatment with the injectable extended release opioid antagonist naltrexone (XRNTX). The study was not placebo-controlled.
Results
The behavioral effect of baby schema, indexed by “cuteness” ratings, was present and unaffected by XRNTX. The brain response to baby schema was absent at baseline, but present in the bilateral ventral striatum after two weeks of XRNTX treatment. The decline in self-reported craving for opioids was positively correlated with the brain fMRI response to baby schema in the bilateral ventral striatum.
Conclusions
Opioid antagonist treatment modulated the brain reward system response to a marker of caregiving motivation in patients with opioid use disorder. Neural response to baby schema may offer a novel probe of social motivation and affiliative behaviors in this population."

The anterior insula (AI) participates in emotional salience detection; and the posterior insula (PI) participates in sensorimotor integration and response selection. Meta-analyses have noted insula-based aberrant connectivity within ASD. Given the observed social impairments in ASD and the role of the insula in social information processing (SIP), investigating functional organization of this structure in ASD is important. We investigated differences in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) using fMRI in male youths with (N=13; mean=14.6 years; range: 10.2–18.0 years) and without ASD (N=17; mean=14.5 years; range: 10.0–17.5 years). With seed-based FC measures, we compared RSFC in insular networks. Hypoconnectivity was observed in ASD (AI-superior frontal gyrus (SFG); AI-thalamus; PI-inferior parietal lobule (IPL); PI-fusiform gyrus (FG); PI-lentiform nucleus/putamen). Using the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) to assess social functioning, regression analyses yielded negative correlations between SCQ scores and RSFC (AI-SFG; AI-thalamus; PI-FG; PI-IPL). Given the insula's connections to limbic regions, and its role in integrating external sensory stimuli with internal states, atypical activity in this structure may be associated with social deficits characterizing ASD. Our results suggest further investigation of the insula's role in SIP across a continuum of social abilities is needed."

Or might there be situations in which being with friends or even merely thinking of friends or the friendships we have with them can actually improve self-control? In five studies, using a unique combination of controlled experiments examining overt consumer behavior and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we propose and show that the extent to which consumers identify a goal conflict between giving in to buying temptations on the one hand and the perceived consequences for maintaining satisfactory relationships with close friends on the other is a critical mediator of whether friendship reminders decrease or increase self-control. We further show that such a goal conflict is most likely for consumers with a chronic, compulsive tendency for uncontrolled, disinhibited acquisition and consumption—for consumers classified as compulsive buyers. For their non-compulsive counterparts, in contrast, acts of acquisition and consumption, even incidental disinhibited ones, are perceived to be less problematic in light of their friendships and hence do not induce a goal conflict to the same extent. Our findings provide insights into social influences on self-control and identify the concept of friendship reminders as a way to reduce a common type of dysfunctional consumer behavior. In addition to enhancing consumer well-being, reducing compulsive buying will substantially reduce handling costs for organizations. Hence, the findings are of academic, societal and managerial relevance."

Current studies emphasize a underconnectivity in ASD, particularly for brain systems that support abstract social reasoning and introspective thought. Here, we evaluate intrinsic connectivity in children with ASD, targeting brain systems that support the developmental precursors to social reasoning, namely perception of social cues and joint attention. Using resting state fMRI made available through the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE), we compute functional connectivity within and between nodes in the action observation, attention and social cognitive networks in children and adolescents with ASD. We also compare connectivity strength to observational assessments that explicitly evaluate severity of ASD on two distinct subdomains using the ADOS-Revised schedule: social affective (SA) and restricted, repetitive behaviors (RRB). Compared to age-matched controls, children with ASD have decreased functional connectivity in a number of connections in the action observation network, particularly in the lateral occipital cortex (LOTC) and fusiform gyrus (FG). Distinct patterns of connections were also correlated with symptom severity on the two subdomains of the ADOS. ADOS-SA severity most strongly correlated with connectivity to the left TPJ, while ADOS-RRB severity correlated with connectivity to the dMPFC. We conclude that atypical connectivity in the action observation system may underlie some of the more complex deficits in social cognitive systems in ASD."

We compared brain function and behavior during extinction recall in a sample of 11-to-15-year-old children characterized in early childhood on a continuum of SR. Three weeks after undergoing fear conditioning and extinction, participants completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging extinction recall task assessing memory and threat differentiation for conditioned stimuli. Whereas self-report and psychophysiological measures of differential conditioning, extinction, and extinction recall were largely similar across participants, SR-related differences in brain function emerged during extinction recall. Specifically, childhood SR was associated with a distinct pattern of hemodynamic-autonomic covariation in the brain when recalling extinguished threat and safety cues. SR and attention focus impacted associations between trial-by-trial variation in autonomic responding and in brain activation. These interactions occurred in three main brain areas: the anterior insular cortex (AIC), the anterior subdivision of the medial cingulate cortex (aMCC), and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). This pattern of SCR-BOLD coupling may reflect selective difficulty tracking safety in a temperamentally at-risk population."

In this study, participants (N = 56 males) were subjected to the Trier Social Stress Test or a placebo version. After that, all participants underwent an appetitive conditioning paradigm in the fMRI, in which one neutral cue (CS+) was repeatedly paired with reward, while another (CS-) was not. Importantly, the stress-group revealed overgeneralization of conditioning to the CS- on the behavioral level. On the neural level, stressed participants showed increased connectivity between the hippocampus and amygdala, vACC, and OFC, which maintain specificity of conditioning and also showed reduced differential activation.

Indeed, qualities of mothers’ voices are shown to contribute to children's social development. Our knowledge of how the mother's voice is processed at the neural level, however, is limited. This study investigated whether the voice of a mother modulates activation in the network of regions activated by the human voice in young children differently than the voice of an unfamiliar mother. We collected fMRI data from 32 typically developing 7- and 8-year-olds as they listened to natural speech produced by their mother and another child's mother. We used emotionally-varied natural speech stimuli to approximate the range of children's day-to-day experience. We individually-defined functional ROIs in children's voice-sensitive neural network and then independently investigated the extent to which activation in these regions is modulated by speaker identity. The bilateral posterior auditory cortex, superior temporal gyrus (STG), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) exhibit enhanced activation in response to the voice of one's own mother versus that of an unfamiliar mother. The findings indicate that children process the voice of their own mother uniquely, and pave the way for future studies of how social information processing contributes to the trajectory of child social development."

In two studies, adult participants (male and female) watched brief videos of a range of positive and negative facial expressions, while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (Study 1: ASD n = 16, control n = 21; Study 2: ASD n = 22, control n = 30). Patterns of hemodynamic activity differentiated among facial emotional expressions in left and right superior temporal sulcus, fusiform gyrus, and parts of medial prefrontal cortex. In both control participants and high-functioning individuals with ASD, we observed (i) similar responses to emotional valence that generalized across facial expressions and animated social events; (ii) similar flexibility of responses to emotional valence, when manipulating the task-relevance of perceived emotions; and (iii) similar responses to a range of emotions within valence. Altogether, the data indicate that there was little or no group difference in cortical responses to isolated dynamic emotional facial expressions, as measured with fMRI. Difficulties with real-world social communication and social interaction in ASD may instead reflect differences in initiating and maintaining contingent interactions, or in integrating social information over time or context."

In humans, intranasal oxytocin (INOT) has been shown to modulate various aspects of social behavior, such as empathy, trust, in-group preference, and memory of socially relevant cues. Most INOT studies employ cross-sectional designs despite the enhanced statistical power and reduction in error variance associated with individual differences characteristic of within-subject designs. Using the Prisoner Dilemma task, which models a real-life dyadic social interaction, our group has systematically explored the effect of INOT on social cooperation and non-cooperation using a cross-sectional design. In the current study, we investigated if the main findings from our cross-sectional study could be replicated in a within-subject design using the same paradigm and whether new findings would emerge. We found OT to attenuate the ventral tegmental area response to reciprocated cooperation in women, an effect that is also present in our cross-sectional sample. However, other cross-sectional findings, especially those found in men, were not observed in this within-subject study. We hypothesize that the discrepancy can be explained by differing OT effects based on the degree of stimulus novelty/familiarity. Our within-subject study also revealed new effects not found previously in our cross-sectional study. Most importantly, OT treatment on scan 2 blocked amygdala habituation to unreciprocated cooperation found in a group that received placebo on both scans among men. Our results suggest that exogenous OT reduces the salience of positive social interactions among women and prevents habituation to negative social interactions among men. These findings may have implications for the potential clinical utility of OT as a treatment for psychiatric disorders."

We integrated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and questionnaire measures (Williams creativity aptitude test) of trait creativity and self-construal (e.g., interdependence) in male adults to examine whether trait creativity is associated with neural activities underlying social cognition and whether and how the association is moderated by individuals' self-construals. We found that interdependence moderates the association between trait creativity and neural activities in the left superior temporal sulcus, right anterior insular, right temporal-parietal junction and right precentral gyrus engaged in reflection of one's own social attributes. Interdependence also moderates the association between trait creativity and neural activities in the left superior temporal sulcus and right posterior insular involved in reflection of a friend's social attributes. The link of trait creativity and the functional connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex and postcentral gyri during reflection of a friend's social attributes is also moderated by interdependence. Participants with high and low creativity traits can be dissociated in a three-dimension space defined by integration of interdependence and the brain activity underlying reflection of one's own and the friend's attributes. Our findings suggest that trait creativity is imprinted on the social brain and the link between trait creativity and the neural activities underlying the processing of self and others is moderated by a cultural trait."

Most paradigms that measure personal space preferences involve explicit choice and therefore fail to examine the implicit aspects of such preferences. In the current study, we sought to investigate an implicit form of interpersonal space that is more closely related to real-life situations involving affiliation. We studied the effects of oxytocin (OT) on neural networks that involve affiliation and tested the impact on personal space preferences. In a double-blind placebo-controlled study, we asked participants to choose between two rooms that differed only in the distances between two stimuli. The stimuli were either social stimuli (two chairs) or non-social stimuli (table and plant). The behavioral results showed that OT caused participants to choose a closer space in social blocks but did not affect their choices in non-social blocks. Imaging results revealed an interaction between stimulus and treatment (OT/PL) in the dorsal striatum, an area that is related to approach motivation and is part of the reward circuitry. Specifically, OT increased activity in the dorsal striatum in the social blocks and decreased this activity in the non-social blocks. The results of the study strengthen the social salience theory regarding OT, indicating that OT does not uniformly affect all social responses and that context has a determining impact on our behavior."

As expected, social exclusion elicited well-documented affective and neural responses, i.e., increased anger and distress, as well as increased exclusion-related activation of the anterior insula, the posterior-medial frontal cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex. Cortisol and testosterone decreased over the course of the experiment, whereas progesterone showed no changes.

Resting-state fMRI time series data were acquired from 23 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 23 healthy volunteers. The results revealed that patients with schizophrenia show significantly decreased connectivity between a range of brain regions, particularly involving connections among the right orbitofrontal cortex, bilateral putamen and left amygdala. Furthermore, topological properties of functional brain networks in patients with schizophrenia were characterized by reduced path length compared to healthy controls; however, no significant difference was found for clustering coefficient, local efficiency or global efficiency. Additionally, we found that nodal efficiency of the amygdala and the putamen were significantly correlated with the independence-performance subscale of social functioning scale (SFC), and Reading the Mind in the Eyes test; however, the correlations do not survive correction for multiple comparison. The current results help to clarify the relationship between social functioning deficits and topological brain measures in schizophrenia."

Two groups of adolescent girls (AN-A, weight-recovered following AN) and (HC-A, healthy comparison) completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging task involving social evaluations, allowing comparison of neural activations during self-evaluations, friend-evaluations, and perspective-taking self-evaluations. Although the two groups were not different in their whole-brain activations, anxiety and body shape concerns were correlated with neural activity in a priori regions of interest. A cluster in medial prefrontal cortex and the dorsal anterior cingulate correlated with the body shape questionnaire; subjects with more body shape concerns used this area less during self than friend evaluations. A cluster in medial prefrontal cortex and the cingulate also correlated with anxiety such that more anxiety was associated with engagement when disagreeing rather than agreeing with social terms during self-evaluations. This data suggests that differences in the utilization of frontal brain regions during social evaluations may contribute to both anxiety and body shape concerns in adolescents with AN. Clinical follow-up was obtained, allowing exploration of whether brain function early in course of disease relates to illness trajectory. The adolescents successful in recovery used the posterior cingulate and precuneus more for friend than self evaluations than the adolescents that remained ill, suggesting that neural differences related to social evaluations may provide clinical predictive value. Utilization of both MPFC and the precuneus during social and self evaluations may be a key biological component for achieving sustained weight-recovery in adolescents with AN."

The additional eye-tracking experiment showed that participants spent more time viewing the portrait’s eyes and mouth when the portrait’s gaze was directed towards the observer. These results suggest that static and, in some cases, highly stylized depictions of human beings in artistic portraits elicit brain activation commensurate with the experience of being observed by a watchful intelligent being. They thus involve observers in implicit inferences of the painted subject’s mental states and emotions. We further confirm the substantial influence of representational medium on brain activity."

Some generosity incurs a definite cost, with no extrinsic reward to the act, but instead provides intrinsic satisfaction (labelled here as ‘altruistic’ giving). Other giving behaviours are done with the prospect of improving one's own situation via reciprocity, reputation, or public good (labelled here as ‘strategic’ giving). These contexts differ in the source, certainty, and timing of rewards as well as the inferences made about others' mental states. We executed a combined statistical map and coordinate-based fMRI meta-analysis of decisions to give (36 studies, 1150 participants). Methods included a novel approach for accommodating variable signal dropout between studies in meta-analysis. Results reveal consistent, cross-paradigm neural correlates of each decision type, commonalities, and informative differences. Relative to being selfish, altruistic and strategic giving activate overlapping reward networks. However, strategic decisions showed greater activity in striatal regions than altruistic choices. Altruistic giving, more than strategic, activated subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC). Ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is consistently involved during generous decisions and processing across a posterior to anterior axis differentiates the altruistic/strategic context. Posterior vmPFC was preferentially recruited during altruistic decisions. Regions of the ‘social brain’ showed distinct patterns of activity between choice types, reflecting the different use of theory of mind in the two contexts. We provide the consistent neural correlates of decisions to give, and show that many will depend on the source of incentives."

abstract = "Background
Enhanced memory for self-oriented information is known as the self-referential memory (SRM) effect. fMRI studies of the SRM effect have focused almost exclusively on encoding, revealing selective engagement of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during “self” relative to other processing conditions. Other critical areas for self-processing include ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and posterior cingulate/precuneus (PCC/PC). Previous behavioral studies show that individuals with schizophrenia fail to benefit from this memory boost. However, the neural correlates of this deficit, at either encoding or retrieval, are unknown.
Methods
Twenty individuals with schizophrenia and 16 healthy controls completed an event-related fMRI SRM paradigm. During encoding, trait adjectives were judged in terms of structural features (“case” condition), social desirability (“other” condition), or as self-referential (“self” condition). Participants then completed an unexpected recognition test (retrieval phase). We examined BOLD activation during both encoding and retrieval within mPFC, vlPFC, TPJ, and PCC/PC regions-of-interest (ROIs).
Results
During encoding, fMRI data indicated both groups had greater activation during the “self” relative to the “other” condition across ROIs. Controls showed this primarily in mPFC whereas patients showed this in PCC/PC. During retrieval, fMRI data indicated controls showed differentiation across ROIs between “self” and “other” conditions, but patients did not.
Conclusions
Results suggest regional differences in the neural processing of self-referential information in individuals with schizophrenia, perhaps because representation of the self is not as well established in patients relative to controls. The current study presents novel findings that add to the literature implicating impaired self-oriented processing in schizophrenia."

A prefrontal cortex (PFC)-amygdala circuit appears to underlie these important emotional processes. However, limited human neuroimaging research has investigated whether these brain regions underlie the altered emotional function that develops with stress. Therefore, the present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate stress-induced changes in PFC-amygdala function during Pavlovian fear conditioning. Participants completed a variant of the Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST) followed (25 min later) by a Pavlovian fear conditioning task during fMRI. Self-reported stress to the MIST was used to identify three stress-reactivity groups (Low, Medium, and High). Psychophysiological, behavioral, and fMRI signal responses were compared between the three stress-reactivity groups during fear conditioning. Fear learning, indexed via participant expectation of the unconditioned stimulus during conditioning, increased with stress reactivity. Further, the High stress-reactivity group demonstrated greater autonomic arousal (i.e., skin conductance response, SCR) to both conditioned and unconditioned stimuli compared to the Low and Medium stress-reactivity groups. Finally, the High stress group did not regulate the emotional response to threat. More specifically, the High stress-reactivity group did not show a negative relationship between conditioned and unconditioned SCRs. Stress-induced changes in these emotional processes paralleled changes in dorsolateral, dorsomedial, and ventromedial PFC function. These findings demonstrate that acute stress facilitates fear learning, enhances autonomic arousal, and impairs emotion regulation, and suggests these stress-induced changes in emotional function are mediated by the PFC."

Since voice perception is sustained by a complex brain network involving temporal voice areas (TVAs) and, even if less consistently, extra-temporal regions such as frontal cortices, functional connectivity (FC) during an fMRI voice localizer (passive listening of voices vs non-voices) has been computed within twelve temporal and frontal voice-sensitive regions (“voice patches”) individually defined for each subject (N = 90) to account for inter-individual variability. Results revealed that voice patches were positively co-activated during voice listening and that they were characterized by different FC pattern depending on the location (anterior/posterior) and the hemisphere. Importantly, FC between right frontal and temporal voice patches was behaviorally relevant: FC significantly increased with voice recognition abilities as measured in a voice recognition test performed outside the scanner. Hence, this study highlights the importance of frontal regions in voice perception and it supports the idea that looking at FC between stimulus-specific and higher-order frontal regions can help understanding individual differences in processing social stimuli such as voices."

Here, in two fMRI experiments, we investigate the representational content of these regions. Building on existing computational and neural evidence, we hypothesized that social brain regions contain at least two functionally and spatially distinct components: one that represents information related to others' motivations and values, and another that represents information about others' beliefs and knowledge. Using multi-voxel pattern analysis, we find evidence that motivational versus epistemic features are independently represented by theory of mind (ToM) regions: RTPJ contains information about the justification of the belief, bilateral TPJ represents the modality of the source of knowledge, and VMPFC represents the valence of the resulting emotion. These representations are found only in regions implicated in social cognition and predict behavioral responses at the level of single items. We argue that cortical regions implicated in mental state inference contain complementary, but distinct, representations of epistemic and motivational features of others' beliefs, and that, mirroring the processes observed in sensory systems, social stimuli are represented in distinct and distributed formats across the human brain."

Combining the tools of instantaneous phase synchronization and independent component analysis, we characterize whole-brain task-driven responses in terms of group-wise similarity in temporal signal dynamics of brain networks. We applied this framework to fMRI data collected during performance of a simple motor task and a social cognitive task. Analyses using an inter-subject phase synchronization approach revealed a large number of brain networks that dynamically synchronized to various features of the task, often not predicted by the hypothesized temporal structure of the task.

Addicts to specific internet applications involving communication features showed increased social anxiety, emotional competence deficits and impaired prefrontal-related inhibitory control. The dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex (dACC) likely plays an important role in cognitive control and negative affect (such as social exclusion, pain or anxiety).
Aim
To assess (social) anxiety-related inhibitory control in specific internet addiction (addicted use of games and social networks) and its relation to altered dACC activation.
Methods
N=44 controls and n=51 specific internet addicts completed an anxious words-based Affective Go/No-Go task (AGN). A subsample of n=23 healthy controls and n=25 specific internet addicts underwent functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) while completing an Emotional Stroop Task (EST) with socially anxious, positive, negative and neutral words. Subgroups of internet gaming and social network addicts were exploratively assessed. Psychometric measures of social anxiety, emotional competence and impulsivity were additionally explored.
Results
Specific internet addicts showed higher impulsivity, social anxiety and reduced emotional competence. Between-group differences in AGN and EST behavioral measures were not detected. No group differences were found in the dACC, but explorative analyses revealed decreased left middle and superior temporal gyrus activation during interference of socially anxious words in internet gaming and relative to social network addicts.
Conclusion
Given the function of the left middle temporal gyrus in the retrieval of words or expressions during communication, our findings give a first hint that social words might be less retrievable in the semantic storage of internet gaming addicts, possibly indicating deficiencies in handling speech in social situations."

While most studies have focused on brain connectivity during resting state episodes and regions of interest approaches (ROI), a wealth of task-based fMRI datasets have been acquired in these populations in the last decade. This calls for techniques that can leverage information not only from a single dataset, but from several existing datasets that might share some common features and biomarkers. We propose a fully data-driven (voxel-based) approach that we apply to two different fMRI experiments with social stimuli (faces and bodies). The method, based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), is first trained for each experiment independently and each output is then combined to obtain a final classification output. Second, this RFE output is used to determine which voxels are most often selected for classification to generate maps of significant discriminative activity. Finally, to further explore the clinical validity of the approach, we correlate phenotypic information with obtained classifier scores. The results reveal good classification accuracy (range between 69% and 92.3%). Moreover, we were able to identify discriminative activity patterns pertaining to the social brain without relying on a priori ROI definitions. Finally, social motivation was the only dimension which correlated with classifier scores, suggesting that it is the main dimension captured by the classifiers. Altogether, we believe that the present RFE method proves to be efficient and may help identifying relevant biomarkers by taking advantage of acquired task-based fMRI datasets in psychiatric populations."

abstract = "Adolescence is a period of sensitivity to social stimuli. In particular, research has focused on the increased sensitivity to risks and social information seen during adolescence. However, recent evidence also suggests that adolescents can flexibly use information in service of their goals, raising an interesting question: are adolescents able to selectively discount social information if it conflicts with their goals? To test this question, fifty-five children and adolescents (ages 8–17 years) completed a social variant of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task during an fMRI session. Adolescents showed decreased tracking of negative social feedback in regions involved in salience-monitoring (e.g. insula) and social processing (e.g., TPJ, pSTS). Age-related changes in neural processing of risk and social feedback contributed to better performance for older participants. These results suggest that adolescents are able to suppress goal-irrelevant social feedback, rather than being uniformly hyper-sensitive to social information."

Here we investigated the neural correlates of spontaneous socially mindful and unmindful behaviours. Functional magnetic resonance data were acquired from 47 healthy adolescents and young adults (age 16–27) as they completed the SoMi task. Being faced with socially relevant choices was associated with activity in the medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, caudate, and insula, which is consistent with prior neuroeconomical research. Importantly, socially mindful choices were associated with activity in the right parietal cortex and the caudate, whereas unmindful choices were associated with activity in the left prefrontal cortex. These neural findings were consistent with the behavioural preference for mindful choices, suggesting that socially mindful decisions are the basic inclination, whereas socially unmindful responses may require greater effort and control. Together, these results begin to uncover the neural correlates of socially mindful and unmindful choices, and illuminate the psychological processes involved in cooperative social behaviour."

abstract = "Background
Following concussion, adolescents may experience both poor inhibitory control and increased depressive symptoms. fMRI research suggests that adolescents with major depressive disorder have abnormal physiological responses in the frontostriatal pathway, and exhibit poorer inhibitory control in the presence of negatively-aroused images. The scarcity of information surrounding depression following concussion in adolescents makes it difficult to identify patients at risk of depression after injury. This is the first study to examine neural activity patterns in adolescents with post-concussive depressive symptoms.
Purpose
To explore the effect of depressive symptoms on inhibitory control in adolescents with concussion in the presence of emotional stimuli using fMRI.
Methods
Using a prospective cohort design, 30 adolescents diagnosed with concussion between 10 and 17years were recruited. The Children's Depression Inventory questionnaire was used to divide participants into two groups: average or elevated levels of depressive symptoms. Participants completed an Emotional Go/No-Go task involving angry or neutral faces in a 3Telsa MRI scanner.
Results
Eleven participants had elevated depressive symptoms, of which 72% were hit in the occipital region of the head at the time of injury. fMRI results from the Emotional Go/No-Go task revealed activity patterns in the overall sample. Faces activated regions associated with both facial and cognitive processing. However, frontal regions that are usually associated with inhibitory control were not activated. Adolescents with elevated levels of depressive symptoms engaged more frontal lobe regions during the task than the average group. They also showed a trend towards worse symptoms following MRI scanning.
Conclusions
Adolescents with elevated depressive symptoms engaged brain regions subserving evaluative processing of social interactions. This finding provides insight into the role the environment plays in contributing to the cognitive demands placed on adolescents recovering from concussion."

The participants reported a significantly higher subjective feeling of being followed by the agent in the first condition. Moreover, almost all participants preferred the agent that followed their drum-hitting rhythm. The activity of the caudate nucleus, which is one of the reward-related brain structures, was found to be associated with the subjective feeling of being followed, suggesting that the sense of being the leader, in an interpersonal rhythmic interaction, creates a pleasant feeling."

Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines have been associated with increased neural sensitivity to social rejection and social threat, but also decreased neural sensitivity to rewards. However, recent evidence suggests that inflammation may actually enhance sensitivity to certain social rewards, such as those that signal support and care. Despite a growing interest in how inflammation influences neural reactivity to positive and negative social experiences, no known studies have investigated these processes in the same participants, using a similar task. To examine this issue, 107 participants were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or low-dose endotoxin, which safely triggers an inflammatory response. When levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were at their peak, participants were scanned using fMRI while they received positive, negative, and neutral feedback from an “evaluator” (actually a confederate) about how they came across in an audio-recorded interview. In response to negative feedback (vs. neutral), participants in the endotoxin condition showed heightened neural activity in a number of threat-related neural regions (i.e., bilateral amygdala, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) and a key mentalizing-related region (i.e., dorsomedial PFC), compared to placebo participants. Interestingly, when receiving positive feedback (vs. neutral), endotoxin (vs. placebo) led to greater neural activity in the ventral striatum and ventromedial PFC, regions often implicated in processing reward, as well as greater activity in dorsomedial PFC. Together, these results reveal that individuals exposed to an inflammatory challenge are more “neurally sensitive” to both negative and positive social feedback, suggesting that inflammation may lead to a greater vigilance for both social threats and social rewards."

Our comprehensive approach revealed that engaging in positive-social emotion regulation with a self-referential first-person perspective is characterized by dynamic interactions between functionally specialized prefrontal cortex (PFC) areas, the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and the amygdala. Increased top-down connectivity from the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) controls affective valuation in the ventromedial and dorsomedial PFC, self-referential processes in the TPJ, and modulate emotional responses in the amygdala via the ventromedial PFC. Understanding the brain networks engaged in the regulation of positive-social emotions that involve a first-person perspective is important as they are known to constitute an effective strategy in therapeutic settings."

Converging evidence indicates that brain abnormalities in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) involve atypical network connectivity. Given the central role of social deficits in the ASD phenotype, this investigation examined functional connectivity of the amygdala—a brain structure critically involved in processing of social information—in children and adolescents with ASDs, as well as age-dependent changes and links with clinical symptoms.
Method
Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data from 55 participants with ASDs and 50 typically developing (TD) controls, aged 7 to 17 years, were included. Groups were matched for age, gender, IQ, and head motion. Functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) analysis was applied to examine intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) of the amygdala, including cross-sectional tests of age-related changes.
Results
Direct between-group comparisons revealed reduced functional connectivity between bilateral amygdalae and left inferior occipital cortex, accompanied by greater connectivity between right amygdala and right sensorimotor cortex in the ASD group. This atypical pattern of amygdala connectivity was associated with decreased symptom severity and better overall functioning, as specifically seen in an ASD subgroup with the most atypical amygdala iFC but the least impaired social functioning. Age-related strengthening of amygdala−prefrontal connectivity, as observed in the TD group, was not detected in children with ASDs.
Conclusion
Findings support aberrant network sculpting in ASDs, specifically atypical integration between amygdala and primary sensorimotor circuits. Paradoxical links between atypical iFC and behavioral measures suggest that abnormal amygdala functional connections may be compensatory in some individuals with ASDs."

We investigated influences of genetics and environment on experiencing social exclusion and compensating for social exclusion of others with the Prosocial Cyberball Game using fMRI in a twin sample (aged 7–9; N = 500). Neuroimaging analyses (N = 283) revealed that experiencing possible self-exclusion resulted in activity in inferior frontal gyrus and medial prefrontal cortex, which was influenced by genetics and unique environment. Experiencing self-inclusion was associated with activity in anterior cingulate cortex, insula and striatum, but this was not significantly explained by genetics or shared environment. We found that children show prosocial compensating behavior when observing social exclusion. Prosocial compensating behavior was associated with activity in posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus, and showed unique environmental effects or measurement error at both behavioral and neural level. Together, these findings show that in children neural activation for experiencing possible self-exclusion and self-inclusion, and for displaying prosocial compensating behavior, is accounted for by unique environmental factors and measurement error, with a small genetic effect on possible self-exclusion."

Continued development and refinement of resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) fMRI techniques in both animal and clinical studies has enhanced our comprehension of the adverse effects of stress on psychiatric health. The objective of the current study was to assess both maternal behavior and resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) changes in these animals when they were dams caring for their own young. It was hypothesized that ECSS exposed dams would express depressed maternal care and exhibit similar (same networks), yet different specific changes in RSFC (different individual nuclei) than reported when they were adult females.
Methods
We have developed an ethologically relevant transgenerational model of the role of chronic social stress (CSS) in the etiology of postpartum depression and anxiety. Initial fMRI investigation of the CSS model indicates that early life exposure to CSS (ECSS) induces long term changes in functional connectivity in adult nulliparous female F1 offspring.
Results
ECSS in F1 dams resulted in depressed maternal care specifically during early lactation, consistent with previous CSS studies, and induced changes in functional connectivity in regions associated with sensory processing, maternal and emotional responsiveness, memory, and the reward pathway, with robust changes in anterior cingulate circuits.
Limitations
The sample sizes for the fMRI groups were low, limiting statistical power.
Conclusion
This behavioral and functional neuroanatomical foundation can now be used to enhance our understanding of the neural etiology of early life stress associated disorders and test preventative measures and treatments for stress related disorders."

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are diagnosed based on early-manifesting clinical symptoms, including markedly impaired social communication. We assessed the viability of resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) connectivity measures as diagnostic biomarkers for ASD and investigated which connectivity features are predictive of a diagnosis.
Methods
Rs-fMRI scans from 59 high functioning males with ASD and 59 age- and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) males were used to build a series of machine learning classifiers. Classification features were obtained using 3 sets of brain regions. Another set of classifiers was built from participants' scores on behavioral metrics. An additional age and IQ-matched cohort of 178 individuals (89 ASD; 89 TD) from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) open-access dataset (http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/) were included for replication.
Results
High classification accuracy was achieved through several rs-fMRI methods (peak accuracy 76.67%). However, classification via behavioral measures consistently surpassed rs-fMRI classifiers (peak accuracy 95.19%). The class probability estimates, P(ASD|fMRI data), from brain-based classifiers significantly correlated with scores on a measure of social functioning, the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), as did the most informative features from 2 of the 3 sets of brain-based features. The most informative connections predominantly originated from regions strongly associated with social functioning.
Conclusions
While individuals can be classified as having ASD with statistically significant accuracy from their rs-fMRI scans alone, this method falls short of biomarker standards. Classification methods provided further evidence that ASD functional connectivity is characterized by dysfunction of large-scale functional networks, particularly those involved in social information processing."

Depressive patients often have emotional recognition disorders, but the reasons remain unclear. Though a great many functional abnormalities have been observed in the brains of depressed patients, such abnormalities are not often related to clinical symptoms. Currently in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), syndrome differentiation for the MDD mainly consists of excess pattern (EP), and deficiency pattern (DP). EP and DP emphasize balance-regulation thought processes, and are widely used in diagnosis of diseases including depression, anxiety, insomnia, and other emotional disorders. We hope that syndrome differentiation in TCM can combine clinical symptoms and brain function more effectively. The present study investigated altered patterns and different association of brain activation in MDD patients with EP and DP during a facial emotion discrimination task with fMRI. Methods:A total of 45 patients (20 with EP and 25 with DP) and 18 normal controls participated in this study. Whole-brain functional scans were collected for each subject. Different patterns of brain activation and association during the facial emotion discrimination task were analyzed statistically. Results:Comparing all the MDD patients with the normal controls, there were no significant differences for sad vs. neutral condition or for happy vs. neutral condition (corrected p >  0.05). One-way ANCOVA showed significant differences in the left inferior frontal gyrus, the left insula, and the left caudate for sad vs. neutral condition across the DP, EP and NC groups (corrected p <  0.05). The whole brain activation comparison for sad vs. neutral condition between the EP MDD subtype and the DP MDD subtype further verified these differences in the left insula and left inferior frontal gyrus, discovering that these regions showed increased activation in EP MDD subtype compared with the DP MDD subtype (corrected p <  0.05). There were no significant differences in brain activation between each MDD subtype and the normal controls. Conclusion:Disparities in sad face processing exist between MDD patients with different TCM syndrome types, suggesting that TCM syndrome differentiation may provide a biological basis for negativity bias in depression, and may determine both symptom formation and social dysfunction."

We predicted that while processing gestures with social intent extraversion would be associated with increased activity within the reticulothalamic–cortical arousal system (RTCS), while neuroticism would be associated with increased activity in emotion processing circuits. The obtained findings partly support our hypotheses. We found a positive correlation between bilateral thalamic activity and extraversion scores while participants viewed social (versus nonsocial) gestures. For neuroticism, the data revealed a more complex activation pattern. Activity in the bilateral frontal operculum and anterior insula, extending into bilateral putamen and right amygdala, was moderated as a function of actor-orientation (i.e., first versus third-person engagement) and face-visibility (actor faces visible versus blurred). Our findings point to the existence of factors other than emotional valence that can influence social gesture processing in particular, and social cognitive affective processing in general, as a function of personality."

Neuroimaging studies suggest that social distress and suicidal vulnerability share common cerebral bases. Moreover, increased peripheral inflammatory activity is involved in both social distress and suicidal behavior.
Objective
To evaluate, in suicidal and non-suicidal individuals, the association between the activation of specific cerebral regions (anterior cingulate, insula and orbitofrontal cortex) during experimental social exclusion and the baseline blood levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2).
Methods
In total, 101 euthymic women were recruited: 42 suicide attempters (SA), 40 affective controls (AC), and 19 healthy controls (HC). During functional MRI (fMRI), they performed the Cyberball game, a validated social exclusion task. Blood levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and IL-2 were measured prior to fMRI. The activation of insula, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during the explicit social exclusion (ESE) vs social inclusion (INC) conditions of the Cyberball game was analyzed in function of the baseline cytokine levels.
Results
IL-1β was negatively associated with right OFC activation (p = 0.01) in ESE vs. INC, whereas IL-2 was positively associated with activation of the right ACC (p = 0.02), insula (p = 0.002) and OFC (p = 0.004) in ESE vs. INC. These associations remained significant after controlling for group, indicating that they were independent of the suicidal status.
Conclusion
Baseline IL-1β and IL-2 blood levels are differentially associated with cerebral activation involved in the perception of social exclusion, independently of suicidal behavior. Our results may help to better understand the role of basal inflammation in social distress and its link with mood disorder pathophysiology."

Responding adaptively to one's social environment is a key factor predicting the course of major depressive disorder (MDD). Socially rejecting events can exacerbate, whereas socially accepting events can ameliorate depressive symptoms. The neural responses to rejection and acceptance in MDD are relatively unexplored.
Methods
We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure neural responses to romantic rejection and acceptance in women diagnosed with current MDD (n = 19) and a matched group of healthy controls (HCs) (n = 19). During fMRI, participants received rejecting, accepting, and neutral feedback from self-selected potential romantic partners.
Results
In women with MDD but not HCs, rejection significantly increased activity in the right anterior insula relative to neutral feedback. Greater activation during rejection was found in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in MDD compared to HCs. Women with MDD reported stronger emotional responses than HCs to both rejection and acceptance. In addition, left and right nucleus accumbens (NAcc) activity mediated the relationship between trait reward responsiveness and increased ratings of feeling “happy and accepted” following acceptance in HCs, but not the MDD group.
Discussion
Women with MDD were behaviorally and neurally hyperresponsive to rejection. Although both groups were behaviorally responsive to acceptance, in MDD this was dissociated from NAcc activity. These findings highlight abnormal behavioral and neural responses to social cues in MDD, with implications for disease prognosis and the development of novel and sensitive biomarkers for MDD focused on neural pathways for social-affective processing.
Limitations
Conclusions may be limited to depressed women in a romantic context."

Analysis of the purchase intention task revealed a significant positive correlation between ratings of social risk and activity in the anterior insula, an area of the brain that is known as part of the emotion-related network. Analysis of the social risk task revealed a significant positive correlation between ratings of social risk and activity in the temporal parietal junction and the medial prefrontal cortex, which are known as theory-of-mind regions. Our results suggest that the anterior insula processes consumers' social risk implicitly to prompt consumers not to buy socially unacceptable products, whereas ToM-related regions process such risk explicitly in considering the anticipated disapproval of others. These findings may prove helpful in understanding the mental processes involved in purchase decisions."

Humans and other primates have evolved the ability to represent their status in the group’s social hierarchy, which is essential for avoiding harm and accessing resources. Yet it remains unclear how the human brain learns dominance status and adjusts behavior accordingly during dynamic social interactions. Here we address this issue with a combination of fMRI and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In a first fMRI experiment, participants learned an implicit dominance hierarchy while playing a competitive game against three opponents of different skills. Neural activity in the rostromedial PFC (rmPFC) dynamically tracked and updated the dominance status of the opponents, whereas the ventromedial PFC and ventral striatum reacted specifically to competitive victories and defeats. In a second experiment, we applied anodal tDCS over the rmPFC to enhance neural excitability while subjects performed a similar competitive task. The stimulation enhanced the relative weight of victories over defeats in learning social dominance relationships and exacerbated the influence of one’s own dominance over competitive strategies. Importantly, these tDCS effects were specific to trials in which subjects learned about dominance relationships, as they were not present for control choices associated with monetary incentives but no competitive feedback. Taken together, our findings elucidate the role of rmPFC computations in dominance learning and unravel a fundamental mechanism that governs the emergence and maintenance of social dominance relationships in humans."

By acting on similar brain circuits, they might interactively influence human behavior. The current study investigates the causal role of testosterone on aggression-related brain activity and the potential interaction with the MAOA polymorphism. In a double-blind process, 93 healthy males received a testosterone or placebo gel. In an fMRI session, participants performed a Taylor aggression paradigm in which they received provoking feedback and could afterwards decide how aggressively they would react. Testosterone and cortisol levels as well as subjective anger were assessed prior and after the task. Circulating testosterone levels were higher in carriers of the long compared to the short MAOA allele. An interaction of the MAOA polymorphism and testosterone administration was identified in the cuneus, where short allele carriers in the placebo group showed diminished activity in the decision period. Task-related anger was significantly higher in this group. Overall, a mesocorticolimbic network was implicated in processing of high versus low provoking feedback, and core hubs of the default mode network were implicated in the subsequent decision after high versus low provocation. Testosterone administration increased activation in this network. The data provides evidence for an interaction of the MAOA polymorphism and exogenous testosterone on anger and suggests that interactive effects on the brain signal could underlie differential emotional reactivity. The increased default mode activation in the testosterone group suggests an enhanced engagement of social cognition related regions possibly supporting responsivity towards social provocation."

In the current manuscript, we investigated the reward value of the act of mimicking, using a simple task manipulation that involved allowing or inhibiting spontaneous facial mimicry in response to dynamic expressions of positive emotion. We found greater reward-related neural activity in response to the condition where mimicry was allowed compared to that where mimicry was inhibited. The magnitude of this link from mimicry to reward response was positively correlated to trait empathy."

The combination of exceptional statistical power, activation from both motor and multiple non-motor tasks in the same participants, and convergent resting-state networks in the same participants revealed novel aspects of the functional topography of the human cerebellum. Consistent with prior studies there were two distinct representations of motor activation. Newly revealed were three distinct representations each for working memory, language, social, and emotional task processing that were largely separate for these four cognitive and affective domains. In most cases, the task-based activations and the corresponding resting-network correlations were congruent in identifying the two motor representations and the three non-motor representations that were unique to working memory, language, social cognition, and emotion. The definitive localization and characterization of distinct triple representations for cognition and emotion task processing in the cerebellum opens up new basic science questions as to why there are triple representations (what different functions are enabled by the different representations?) and new clinical questions (what are the differing consequences of lesions to the different representations?)."

Various perspectives suggest that live interactions are more rewarding, more attention-grabbing, or require increased mentalizing—thinking about the thoughts of others. Dissociating between these possibilities is difficult because most extant neuroimaging paradigms examining social interaction have not directly compared live paradigms to conventional “offline” (or recorded) paradigms. We developed a novel fMRI paradigm to assess whether and how an interactive context changes the processing of speech matched in content and vocal characteristics. Participants listened to short vignettes—which contained no reference to people or mental states—believing that some vignettes were prerecorded and that others were presented over a real-time audio-feed by a live social partner. In actuality, all speech was prerecorded. Simply believing that speech was live increased activation in each participant’s own mentalizing regions, defined using a functional localizer. Contrasting live to recorded speech did not reveal significant differences in attention or reward regions. Further, higher levels of autistic-like traits were associated with altered neural specialization for live interaction. These results suggest that humans engage in ongoing mentalizing about social partners, even when such mentalizing is not explicitly required, illustrating how social context shapes social cognition. Understanding communication in social context has important implications for typical and atypical social processing, especially for disorders like autism where social difficulties are more acute in live interaction."

Connectivity was reduced between the superficial amygdala and the rostral cingulate cortex and between the centromedial amygdala and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Social inhibition also modulated connectivity in several well-established intrinsic networks; higher social inhibition correlated with reduced connectivity with default mode and dorsal attention networks and enhanced connectivity in salience and executive control networks.

abstract = "Background
The intense loss processing that characterizes grieving may help people to adapt to the loss. However, empirical studies show that more conscious loss-related thinking and greater reactivity to reminders of the deceased correspond to poorer adaptation. These findings raise the possibility that loss processing that is unconscious rather than conscious and is self-generated rather than reactive may facilitate adaptation. Here, we used machine learning to detect a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signature of self-generated unconscious loss processing that we hypothesized to correlate with lower grief severity.
Methods
A total of 29 subjects bereaved within the past 14 months participated. Participants performed a modified Stroop fMRI task using deceased-related words. A machine-learning regression, trained on Stroop fMRI data, learned a neural pattern for deceased-related selective attention (d-SA), the allocation of attention to the deceased. Expression of this pattern was tracked during a subsequent sustained attention fMRI task interspersed with deceased-related thought probes (SART-PROBES). d-SA pattern expression during SART-PROBES blocks without reported thoughts of loss indicated self-generated unconscious loss processing. Grief severity was measured with the Inventory for Complicated Grief.
Results
d-SA expression during SART-PROBES blocks without conscious deceased-related thinking correlated negatively with Inventory for Complicated Grief score (r25 = −.711, p < .001, 95% confidence interval = −0.89 to −0.42), accounting for 50% of variance. This relationship remained significant independent of demographic correlates of Inventory for Complicated Grief (B25 = −30, t = −2.64, p = .02, 95% confidence interval = −56.2 to −4.6). Unconscious d-SA pattern expression also correlated with activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and temporal parietal junction during the SART-PROBES (voxel: p < .001, cluster: p < .05).
Conclusions
Self-generated unconscious loss processing correlated with reduced grief severity. This activity, supported by a cognitive social neural architecture, may advance adaptation to the loss."

Investigating social rewards within the psychosis-spectrum offers an especially useful opportunity, given the high rates of impaired social functioning and social isolation. The goal of this study was to investigate hedonic experience associated with social reward processing as a potential biomarker for psychosis risk. This study used a task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm in adolescents at clinical high-risk for the development of psychosis (CHR, n = 19) and healthy unaffected peers (healthy controls – HC, n = 20). Regional activation and connectivity of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum were examined in response to receiving positive social feedback relative to an ambiguous feedback condition. Expectations of impaired hedonic processes in CHR youth were generally not supported, as there were no group differences in neural response or task-based connectivity. Although interesting relationships were found linking neural reward response and connectivity with social, anticipatory, and consummatory anhedonia in the CHR group, results are difficult to interpret in light of task limitations. We discuss potential implications for future study designs that seek to investigate social reward processing as a biomarker for psychosis risk."

Participants comprised 14 manic patients and 14 matched healthy controls who viewed standardized pictures with social and non-social content during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Region-of-interest-analyses focused on areas related to SC (dorsal/ventral medial prefrontal cortex; temporo–parietal junction), determined by a quantitative meta-analysis. Between-group comparisons (‘social>non-social’) revealed reduced BOLD responses in the right dMPFC in manic patients, but no significant group difference in the ventral MPFC. In addition, manic patients showed elevated BOLD activation in the right temporo–parietal junction during perception of social stimuli, which was correlated with increased delusional ideation. Patients with mania show diminished BOLD responses to social stimuli in the right dMPFC, associated with cognitive SC and this may be related to reported deficits in understanding others׳ mental states. At the same time, manic patients show hyperactivation of the right temporo–parietal junction, likely related to exaggerated attribution of meaning to social stimuli."

Very few studies have examined the neural bases of integrating self-other representation and semantic processing in individuals with ASD. The main objective of this functional MRI study is to examine the role of language and social brain networks in self-other processing in young adults with ASD. Nineteen high-functioning male adults with ASD and 19 age-sex-and-IQ-matched typically developing (TD) control participants made “yes” or “no” judgments of whether an adjective, presented visually, described them (self) or their favorite teacher (other). Both ASD and TD participants showed significantly increased activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) during self and other processing relative to letter search. Analyses of group differences revealed significantly reduced activity in left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG), and left inferior parietal lobule (LIPL) in ASD participants, relative to TD controls. ASD participants also showed significantly weaker functional connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) with several brain areas while processing self-related words. The LIFG and IPL are important regions functionally at the intersection of language and social roles; reduced recruitment of these regions in ASD participants may suggest poor level of semantic and social processing. In addition, poor connectivity of the ACC may suggest the difficulty in meeting the linguistic and social demands of this task in ASD. Overall, this study provides new evidence of the altered recruitment of the neural networks underlying language and social cognition in ASD."

Selection of sexual partners is among the most critical decisions that individuals make and is therefore strongly shaped by evolution. In social species, where communication signals can convey substantial information about the identity, state, or quality of the signaler, accurate interpretation of communication signals for mate choice is crucial. Despite the importance of social information processing, to date, relatively little is known about the neurobiological mechanisms that contribute to sexual decision making and preferences. In this study, we used a combination of whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), immediate early gene expression, and behavior tests to identify the circuits that are important for the perception and evaluation of courtship songs in a female songbird, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata). Female zebra finches are sensitive to subtle differences in male song performance and strongly prefer the longer, faster, and more stereotyped courtship songs to non-courtship renditions. Using BOLD fMRI and EGR1 expression assays, we uncovered a novel region involved in auditory perceptual decision making located in a sensory integrative region of the avian central nidopallium outside the traditionally studied auditory forebrain pathways. Changes in activity in this region in response to acoustically similar but categorically divergent stimuli showed stronger parallels to behavioral responses than an auditory sensory region. These data highlight a potential role for the caudocentral nidopallium (NCC) as a novel node in the avian circuitry underlying the evaluation of acoustic signals and their use in mate choice."

Yet, long-term consequences of cannabis dependence, and whether they differ qualitatively from other drugs, are still poorly understood. A key feature of addictive drugs is that chronic use leads to adaptations in striatal reward processing, blunting responsivity to the substance itself and natural (non-drug) rewards. Against this background, the present study investigated whether cannabis dependence is associated with lasting alterations in behavioral and neural responses to social reward in 23 abstinent cannabis-dependent men and 24 matched non-using controls. In an interpersonal pleasant touch fMRI paradigm, participants were led to believe they were in physical closeness of or touched (CLOSE, TOUCH) by either a male or female experimenter (MALE, FEMALE), allowing contextual modulation of the perceived pleasantness and associated neural responses. Upon female compared to male touch, dependent cannabis users displayed a significantly attenuated increase of pleasantness experience compared to healthy controls. Controls responded to female as compared to male interaction with increased striatal activation whereas cannabis users displayed the opposite activation pattern, with stronger alterations being associated with a higher lifetime exposure to cannabis. Neural processing of pleasant touch in dependent cannabis users was found to be intact. These findings demonstrate that cannabis dependence is linked to blunted striatal processing of non-drug rewards and suggest that these alterations may contribute to social processing deficits."

During the scan, participants completed two tasks: an emotion regulation task and a social stress task. Using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses, we found that positive functional connectivity between the amygdala and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) during the emotion regulation task mediated the association between stress-reactive rumination and depressive symptoms.

Designing new objectively diagnostic methods are burning questions. Dynamical functional connectivity (DFCs) methodology based on fMRI data is an effective lever to investigate changeability evolution in macroscopic neural activity patterns underlying critical aspects of cognition and behavior. However, region properties of brain architecture have been less investigated by special indexes of dynamical graph in general mental disorders. Methods: Embracing the network dynamics concept, we introduce topology entropy index (TE-scores) which is focused on time-varying aspects of FCs, hence develop a new framework for researching the dysfunctional roots of schizophrenia in holism significance. In this work, the important process is to uncover noticeable regions endowed with antagonistic stance in TE-scores of between morbid and normal DFCs of 63 healthy controls (HCs) and 57 chronic schizophrenia patients (SZs). Results: For the whole brain region levels, right olfactory, right hippocampus, left parahippocampal gyrus, right parahippocampal gyrus, left amygdala, and left cuneus in SZs are endowed with significantly different TE-scores. At brain subsystems level, TE-scores in DMN are abnormal in the SZs. Comparison with existing method(s): Topology entropy in DFCs is introduced to explore the dynamical information organization of diverse regions and their abnormal changes in mental illness. Several classical graph indexes (such as degree strength, betweenness, centrality) in the static brain network measure the region importance of FCs under senses of information integration and separation process. Although highly related to degree strength by comparing the corresponding values, topology entropy further explores the regions’ aberrant adaptability of functional contact and function switching. Conclusion: TE-scores of abnormal regions in SZs are associated to the passive apathetic social withdrawal, unusual thought content, disturbance of volition, preoccupation, active social avoidance and hallucinatory symptoms. Thought the strict contrastive study, it is worth stressing that topology entropy is a meaningful biological marker to excavating schizophrenic psychopathology."

In this fMRI investigation, we examine the neural correlates of within-subject variation in consensus bias on a variety of social and political issues. Bias demonstrated a strong association with activity in brain regions implicated in self-related cognition, mentalizing, and valuation. Importantly, however, recruitment of these regions predicted consensus bias only in the presence of social disconfirmation, in the form of feedback discrepant with participants’ own attitudes. These results suggest that the psychological and neural mechanisms underlying the tendency to project attitudes onto others are crucially moderated by motivational factors, including the desire to affirm the normativity of one's own position. This research complements social psychological theorizing about the factors contributing to the FCE, and further emphasizes the role of motivated cognition in social reasoning."

abstract = "Reflecting on oneself and others in relationships is an ability that is central to our social existence. Specifically, considering formative autobiographical experiences in relationships may contribute to more flexibility in perceiving, as well as in shaping present relationships. Reflecting on such experiences mobilizes different social cognitive and affective processes. We aim to explore the neural basis of these processes. With a newly developed functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) task, we investigated brain activation in 35 healthy individuals during recall of relationship episodes involving themselves or others. We found that recalling formative episodes involving themselves modulated brain activity in the right parahippocampus, left precuneus, bilateral fusiform gyrus, bilateral insula, and left presupplementary motor area. These areas are involved in memory processes, self-generated thought, and affective experience. The recall of relationship episodes involving others led to similar activation patterns. Our results underscore the close link between self-reflection, understanding others, and memory processes and emphasize the role of affective dimensions for self-relevant experiences. They contribute to a growing body of research on neural mechanisms involved in complex social cognitive processes decisive for our capacity to navigate our social environment."

Accepted adolescents are highly prosocial. In contrast, popular adolescents, who are central and influential, show prosocial as well as antisocial behaviors, such as peer exclusion. Fifty-two 12–16 year-old adolescents underwent an functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan while playing the ball-tossing game Cyberball in which they received or did not receive the ball from other virtual players. The other virtual players were described as either highly popular or average in popularity. Participants' own popularity and acceptance were assessed with peer nominations at school (n = 31). Participants' acceptance was positively correlated with activity of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during exclusion. Participants' popularity was positively associated with ventral striatum and medial prefrontal cortex activity during exclusion, but only when the excluders were popular virtual players. Participants showed increased rostral ACC activation to inclusion by players who were average in popularity. These findings indicate that peer status plays an important role in adolescents' neural processing of social exclusion and inclusion. Moreover, these findings underscore that popularity and acceptance are distinct types of high peer status in adolescence, with not only distinct behavioral correlates, but also distinct neural correlates."

Exaggerated reactivity to acute psychosocial stress is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic disease. A dysfunction of the cortico-limbic network coordinating the peripheral adaptation to acute stress exposure may constitute a brain mechanism underlying this association. We opted to characterize the changes of this network associated with acute psychosocial stress exposure in individuals with low and high cardiometabolic risk (CMR).
Methods
In 57 subjects without overt cardiac or cerebral disease, the Framingham risk score and presence/absence of type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome defined CMR. Psychosocial stress was induced during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain activity by an established social threat paradigm. Measurements of heart rate, blood pressure and saliva cortisol quantified the peripheral stress reaction. Regression analyses for the anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, insula and regulatory prefrontal regions evaluated the association of stress-associated brain activation and CMR.
Results
Psychosocial stress exposure was associated with an increased activity of a brain network including anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, putamen, insula, parahippocampus and right hippocampus. Psychosocial stress-associated brain activation did neither covary with Framingham risk score nor differ between groups with low or high CMR.
Conclusion
Exposure to acute psychosocial stress induces the activation of a well-defined cortico-limbic network. However, we did not find an association between CMR and this network's stress reactivity."

This study used fMRI to examine brain activity while interpreting communicative intent in 15 high-functioning youth with ASD and 16 age- and IQ-matched typically-developing (TD) controls. Participants completed the task with and without a tactile sensory distracter, and with and without instructions directing their attention to relevant social cues. When completing the task in the presence of the sensory distracter, TD youth showed increased activity in auditory language and frontal regions whereas ASD youth showed decreased activation in these areas. Instructions mitigated this effect such that ASD youth did not decrease activation during tactile stimulation; instead, the ASD group showed increased medial prefrontal activity. SOR severity modulated the effect of the tactile stimulus on social processing. Results demonstrate for the first time a neural mechanism through which sensory stimuli cause disruption of social cognition, and that attentional modulation can restore neural processing of social cues through prefrontal regulation. Findings have implications for novel, integrative interventions that incorporate attentional directives to target both sensory and social symptoms."

Results suggest that dissociable dorsal cognitive (“cool”) and ventral – affective (“hot”) frontal-subcortical circuits (FSC) work together to govern social relationships, with repeated social consequences leading to potentially adaptive – or maladaptive – relationships that can become routinized in the cerebellum. Implications for forming stable, functional, social bonds are considered, followed by recommendations for those who struggle with cool and hot FSC functioning that can hinder the development of adaptive prosocial relationships."

There is great potential to broaden our understanding of how social context and cognitive effort processes, currently addressed in disparate literatures, interact with one another. In this paper, we briefly review the literature on cognitive effort, focusing on effort-linked valuation and the gap in the literature regarding cognitive effort in the social domain. Next, we present a study designed to explore valuation processes linked to cognitive effort within the social context of an inequality manipulation. More specifically, we created monetary inequality among the participant (SELF, endowed with $50) and two confederates: one also endowed with $50 (OTHER HIGH) and another with only $5 (OTHER LOW). We then scanned participants using fMRI as they attempted to earn bonus payments for themselves and others through a cognitively effortful feedback-based learning task. Positive feedback produced significantly greater activation than negative feedback in key valuation regions, the ventral striatum (VS) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), both when participants were performing the task on their own behalf and when earning rewards for others. While reward-related activity in the VS was exaggerated for SELF compared to OTHER HIGH for both positive and negative feedback, activity in the vmPFC did not distinguish between recipients in the group-level results. Furthermore, participants naturally fell into two groups: those most engaged when playing for themselves and those who reported engagement for others. While Self-Engaged participants showed differences between the SELF and both OTHER conditions in the VS and vmPFC, Other-Engaged participants only showed an attenuated response to negative feedback for OTHER HIGH compared to SELF in the VS and no differences between recipient conditions in the vmPFC. Together, this work shows the importance of individual differences and the fragility of advantageous inequality aversion in the face of cognitive effort, highlighting the need to study cognitive effort in the social domain."

We performed behavioral, neuropsychological, and imaging (MRI, DTI, fMRI) evaluations. Neurological and neuropsychological examinations revealed a mixed pattern of affected (executive control/abstraction capacity) and considerably preserved (consciousness, language, memory, spatial orientation, and socio-emotional) functions. Both structural (DTI) and functional (fMRI) connectivity evidenced abnormal anterior connections of the amygdala and parietal networks. In addition, brain structural connectivity analysis revealed almost complete loss of frontal connections, with atypical temporo-posterior pathways. Similarly, functional connectivity showed an aberrant frontoparietal network and relative preservation of the posterior part of the default mode network and the visual network. We discuss this multilevel pattern of behavioral, structural, and functional connectivity results. With its unique pattern of compromised and preserved structures and functions, this exceptional case offers new constraints and challenges for neurocognitive theories."

However, it is unknown to what extent individual differences in neural representation of content and lived experience influence this brain-behavior relationship. We examined whether the strength of content-specific representations during persuasive messaging relates to later behavior change, and whether these relationships change as a function of individuals’ social network composition. In our study, smokers viewed anti-smoking messages while undergoing fMRI and we measured changes in their smoking behavior one month later. Using representational similarity analyses, we found that the degree to which message content (i.e. health, social, or valence information) was represented in a self-related processing MPFC region was associated with later smoking behavior, with increased representations of negatively valenced (risk) information corresponding to greater message-consistent behavior change. Furthermore, the relationship between representations and behavior change depended on social network composition: smokers who had proportionally fewer smokers in their network showed increases in smoking behavior when social or health content was strongly represented in MPFC, whereas message-consistent behavior (i.e., less smoking) was more likely for those with proportionally more smokers in their social network who represented social or health consequences more strongly. These results highlight the dynamic relationship between representations in MPFC and key outcomes such as health behavior change; a complete understanding of the role of MPFC in motivation and action should take into account individual differences in neural representation of stimulus attributes and social context variables such as social network composition."

Oxytocin promotes social skills and improves the quality of face processing in individuals with social dysfunctions such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although one of OT's key functions is to promote social behavior during dynamic social interactions, the neural correlates of this function remain unknown. Here, we combined acute intranasal OT (IN-OT) administration (24 IU) and fMRI with an interactive ball game and a face-matching task in individuals with ASD (N = 20). We found that IN-OT selectively enhanced the brain activity of early visual areas in response to faces as compared to non-social stimuli. OT inhalation modulated the BOLD activity of amygdala and hippocampus in a context-dependent manner. Interestingly, IN-OT intake enhanced the activity of mid-orbitofrontal cortex in response to a fair partner, and insula region in response to an unfair partner. These OT-induced neural responses were accompanied by behavioral improvements in terms of allocating appropriate feelings of trust toward different partners' profiles. Our findings suggest that OT impacts the brain activity of key areas implicated in attention and emotion regulation in an adaptive manner, based on the value of social cues."

We created an fMRI version of the SAT to activate children’s attachment system in fMRI environment and contrasted two conditions in which children were instructed to infer the specific feeling of the boy in the picture or to identify objects or physical activities. In the final fMRI analysis (N = 21), attachment security could be detected at the neural level corresponding to the behavioural differences in the attachment interview. Securely attached children showed greater activation in the frontal, limbic and basal ganglia area which included the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, amygdala, cingulate cortex and striatum, compared to other children who had lower quality of attachment. These regions have a key role in socio-emotional information processing and also represent a brain network related to approach and avoidance motivation in humans. Especially the striatum, strongly linked to reward processing underpinning social approach and avoidance motivation, showed the largest effects in these differences and also positively correlated with emotional openness scores in SAT. This suggests that the quality of attachment configures the approach and avoidance motivational system in our brain mediated by the striatum."

Participants were 28 depressed adolescents (14 with co-morbid NSSI, 79% females) and 15 healthy controls, with an average age of 15.2 years (SD=1.8). Social exclusion was implemented using the Cyberball paradigm ‘Cyberball’ during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

Results point towards divergent processing of social exclusion in depressed adolescents with NSSI as compared to adolescents with mere depression in brain regions previously related to the processing of social exclusion. This finding of distinct neurophysiological responses may stimulate further research on individual treatment approaches."

To explore the domain-general risk factor of early-life social stress in mental illness, rearing rodents in persistent postweaning social isolation has been established as a widely used animal model with translational relevance for neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Although changes in resting-state brain connectivity are a transdiagnostic key finding in neurodevelopmental diseases, a characterization of imaging correlates elicited by early-life social stress is lacking.
Methods
We performed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging of postweaning social isolation rats (N = 23) 9 weeks after isolation. Addressing well-established transdiagnostic connectivity changes of psychiatric disorders, we focused on altered frontal and posterior connectivity using a seed-based approach. Then, we examined changes in regional network architecture and global topology using graph theoretical analysis.
Results
Seed-based analyses demonstrated reduced functional connectivity in frontal brain regions and increased functional connectivity in posterior brain regions of postweaning social isolation rats. Graph analyses revealed a shift of the regional architecture, characterized by loss of dominance of frontal regions and emergence of nonfrontal regions, correlating to our behavioral results, and a reduced modularity in isolation-reared rats.
Conclusions
Our result of functional connectivity alterations in the frontal brain supports previous investigations postulating social neural circuits, including prefrontal brain regions, as key pathways for risk for mental disorders arising through social stressors. We extend this knowledge by demonstrating more widespread changes of brain network organization elicited by early-life social stress, namely a shift of hubness and dysmodularity. Our results highly resemble core alterations in neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in humans."

Little is known regarding the combined influence of psychosocial and neural protective mechanisms against substance use. The present study examined the extent to which neuroimaging measures of disinhibition predicted resilience against binge drinking and marijuana use among youth with a family history of substance use disorder (SUD; FH+), accounting for psychosocial measures of behavioral control.
Methods
Participants were 57 FH+ youth from the Michigan Longitudinal Study categorized into resilient and high-risk groups based on patterns of weekly binge drinking and monthly marijuana use during early adulthood. Psychosocial measures of behavioral control (reactive control and externalizing behavior during early and late adolescence) and neural measures of disinhibition (Go/No-Go task and Monetary Incentive Delay Task (MIDT) measured through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)) were entered sequentially in hierarchical logistic regression models to predict resilient versus high-risk groups.
Results
Greater activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during correctly inhibited trials on the Go/No-Go task was a significant predictor of resilience (OR = 2.46, p < 0.05), over and above greater reactive control in early adolescence (OR = 4.96, p < 0.05) and lower externalizing behavior in late adolescence (OR = 0.64, p < 0.05). Neural activation in the ventral striatum associated with reward anticipation during the MIDT was not a significant predictor of resilience.
Conclusions
Brain function in the right DLPFC associated with inhibitory control may be a neural indicator of resilience against elevated substance use among FH+ youth, even after accounting for psychosocial measures of behavioral control."

abstract = "Background
Although psychological treatments for social anxiety disorder (SAD) can be highly effective, many individuals do not respond to treatment. Identifying factors associated with improved outcomes can facilitate individualized treatment choices. We investigated whether patterns of neural connectivity predicted treatment responses and whether treatment type, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), moderated this effect.
Methods
Participants with SAD (n = 34) underwent fMRI prior to treatment and completed implicit and explicit emotion regulation tasks. Neural connectivity measures were estimates of amygdala-prefrontal cortex connectivity. Treatment responder status was defined using the ‘clinically significant change index’ (Loerinc et al., 2015).
Results
Right amygdala-right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex connectivity during implicit emotion regulation was a significant predictor of treatment response (OR = 9.01, 95% CI = 1.77, 46.0, p = .008). Stronger inverse connectivity was associated with greater likelihood of treatment response. There were no significant neural moderators of treatment response to CBT versus ACT.
Limitations
The primary limitation of this work was the small sample size which restricted the power to detect significant moderation effects, and results should be interpreted as preliminary.
Conclusions
Amygdala-vlPFC connectivity during affect labeling predicted treatment responder status following CBT or ACT for social anxiety disorder. This suggests that the functioning of neural circuitry supporting emotion regulation capacities may be a ‘gateway’ to receiving benefit from psychological treatments. Future work should aim to replicate this effect in a larger sample and consider methods for enhancing functional connectivity within this circuitry as a potential treatment adjunct."

Anticipatory stress (indexed by cortisol) was greater prior to testing in the MRI environment than traditional behavioral laboratory. Furthermore, anticipation of fMRI elicited a cortisol response commensurate with the response to the stress task in the behavioral laboratory. However, in the MRI environment, post-stress cortisol was significantly lower than baseline cortisol.

abstract = "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder in which the severity of symptoms varies over subjects. The iCAPs model (innovation-driven co-activation patterns) is a recently developed spatio-temporal model to describe fMRI data. In this study, the iCAPs model was employed to find functional imaging biomarkers for ASD in resting-state fMRI data. MRI data from 125 ASD patients and 243 healthy controls was selected from the online ABIDE data repository. Following standard fMRI preprocessing steps, the iCAP patterns were fitted to the data to obtain network time series. Furthermore, specific combinations of iCAPs were mapped to behavioral domain time series. To quantify to which extent the time series contribute to the fMRI dynamics, their (temporal) standard deviation was calculated and compared between patients and controls. Abnormalities were found in networks involving subcortical and limbic areas and default mode network regions. When mapping the network dynamics to behavioral domain time series, abnormalities were found in emotional and visual behavioral subdomains, and within the ASD spectrum were more pronounced in subjects with autism compared to Asperger's syndrome. Also a trend towards impairment in networks facilitating social cognition was found. The functional imaging abnormalities are consistent with the behavioral impairments typical for ASD."

It is not yet known if neural abnormalities underlying ToM present early, during the first episode of psychosis (FEP). Fourteen FEP participants and twenty-two healthy control participants, aged 15–25, were included in analyses. All participants had a 3T magnetic resonance imaging scan and completed a block-design picture-story attribution-of-intentions ToM fMRI task, and completed a battery of behavioral social cognitive measures including a ToM task. General linear model analyses were carried out. Post-hoc regression analyses were conducted to explore whether aberrant ToM-related activation in FEP participants was associated with symptomatology and global social and occupational functioning. FEP participants, when compared to healthy controls, had significantly less activity in the right temporoparietal junction, right orbitofrontal cortex and left middle prefrontal/inferior frontal cortex, when making social attributions. Aberrant ToM-related activation in the right temporoparietal junction was associated with severity of overall psychopathology, but not functional outcome. Specific regions of the social brain network, associated with ToM, are dysfunctional in young people with FEP. Future research should determine whether alteration of normal brain functioning in relation to ToM occurs before or during illness onset."

Although previous studies have explored the neural basis of episodic envy via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), little is known about the neural processes associated with dispositional envy. In the present study, we used regional homogeneity (ReHo) as an index in resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) to identify brain regions involved in individual differences in dispositional envy, as measured by the Dispositional Envy Scale (DES). Results showed that ReHo in the inferior/middle frontal gyrus (IFG/MFG) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) positively predicted dispositional envy. Moreover, of all the personality traits measured by the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R), only neuroticism was significantly associated with dispositional envy. Furthermore, neuroticism mediated the underlying association between the ReHo of the IFG/MFG and dispositional envy. Hence, to the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence that spontaneous brain activity in multiple regions related to self-evaluation, social perception, and social emotion contributes to dispositional envy. In addition, our findings reveal that neuroticism may play an important role in the cognitive processing of dispositional envy."

Central to this process are patterns of activation associated with one of our most salient socioemotional cues, the face. In this study, we obtained fMRI activation and high-density ERP source data evoked by parallel face dot-probe tasks from 9-to-12-year-old children. We then integrated the two modalities of data to explore the neural spatial-temporal dynamics of children's face processing. Our results showed that the tomography of the ERP sources broadly corresponded with the fMRI activation evoked by the same facial stimuli. Further, we combined complementary information from fMRI and ERP by defining fMRI activation as functional ROIs and applying them to the ERP source data. Indices of ERP source activity were extracted from these ROIs at three a priori ERP peak latencies critical for face processing. We found distinct temporal patterns among the three time points across ROIs. The observed spatial-temporal profiles converge with a dual-system neural network model for face processing: a core system (including the occipito-temporal and parietal ROIs) supports the early visual analysis of facial features, and an extended system (including the paracentral, limbic, and prefrontal ROIs) processes the socio-emotional meaning gleaned and relayed by the core system. Our results for the first time illustrate the spatial validity of high-density source localization of ERP dot-probe data in children. By directly combining the two modalities of data, our findings provide a novel approach to understanding the spatial-temporal dynamics of face processing. This approach can be applied in future research to investigate different research questions in various study populations."

Research on mental imitation in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has been rather limited compared to that on motor imitation. The main objective of this fMRI study is to determine the differences in brain responses underlying mirroring and mentalizing networks during mental imitation in children and adolescents with ASD. Thirteen high-functioning children and adolescents with ASD and 15 age-and- IQ-matched typically developing (TD) control participants took part in this fMRI study. In the MRI scanner, participants were shown cartoon pictures of people performing everyday actions (Transitive actions: e.g., ironing clothes but with the hand missing; and Intransitive actions: e.g., clapping hands with the palms missing) and were asked to identify which hand or palm orientation would best fit the gap. The main findings are: 1) both groups performed equally while processing transitive and intransitive actions; 2) both tasks yielded activation in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in ASD and TD groups; 3) Increased activation was seen in ASD children, relative to TD, in left ventral premotor and right middle temporal gyrus during intransitive actions; and 4) ASD symptom severity positively correlated with activation in left parietal, right middle temporal, and right premotor regions across all subjects. Overall, our findings suggest that regions mediating mirroring may be recruiting more brain resources in ASD and may have implications for understanding social movement through modeling."

Using a novel fMRI task, we identified neural representations generated during simulation of sensorimotor experiences and evaluated their associations with socioemotional function in 19 individuals with SZ and 24 psychiatrically-healthy controls (HC). Participants watched videos depicting a painful sensorimotor experience in the hand or foot of another person and were then asked to imagine how unpleasant it would be to undergo that experience themselves, eliciting simulation. A localizer task identified regions-of-interest (ROIs) within each participant's sensorimotor cortices (SC) recruited by firsthand sensory experiences in hands and feet. Simulation engaged these ROIs in HC and SZ. Simulation-related activation in ROIs did not differ between groups but was associated with participants’ social function. Findings indicate that simulation elicits specific neural representations within the SC and the strength of these representations might be linked to social function."

There is strong evidence for an involvement of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system for these effects of OT. In contrast, human research rather concentrated on more human concepts of social cognition and behavior (e.g. trust or processing of fearful faces) and mainly focused on the amygdala as the main neurobiological substrate. To extend this view, we wanted to gain more insight into the neurobiological effects of OT in the context of reproduction and attachment in humans and compare these effects to its well-known effects on fear processing. In a double-blind placebo-controlled fMRI study, we investigated 55 healthy young men using intranasal OT administration. During fMRI, participants saw attachment-related erotic scenes and fearful social scenes. Over all participants, OT had a differential effect on processing of erotic and fearful scenes. While OT administration led to a relative increase of neural activation in mesolimbic structures during processing of erotic stimuli, it decreased amygdala activation for fearful stimuli. On the individual level, we observed significant positive correlations between OT induced activation changes across different brain regions and under different stimulus conditions. Our findings extend the already existing animal literature and provide evidence for a similar involvement of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system for OT effects in the context of reproduction and attachment in humans."

Capturing dynamic changes of time-varying correlation structure is scientifically important in spatio-temporal data analysis. We approximate the time-varying empirical estimator of the spatial correlation matrix by groups of selected basis matrices representing substructures of the correlation matrix. After projecting the correlation structure matrix onto a space spanned by basis matrices, we also incorporate varying-coefficient model selection and estimation for signals associated with relevant basis matrices. The unique feature of the proposed method is that signals at local regions corresponding with time can be identified through the proposed penalized objective function. Theoretically, we show model selection consistency and the oracle property in detecting local signals for the varying-coefficient estimators. The proposed method is illustrated through simulation studies and brain fMRI data."

The underlying neural implementation of these mechanisms is receiving growing attention because of its implications for professional, social, and medical contexts. While several fMRI studies converge in assigning a crucial role to a cortico-subcortical network including Anterior Cigulate Cortex (ACC) and striatum, the involvement of Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) during mental effort anticipation has yet to be replicated. This study was designed to target DLPFC contribution to anticipation of a difficult task using functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), as a more cost-effective tool measuring cortical hemodynamics. We adapted a validated mental effort task, where participants performed easy and difficult mental calculation, and measured DLPFC activity during the anticipation phase. As hypothesized, DLPFC activity increased during anticipation of a hard task as compared to an easy task. Besides replicating previous fMRI work, these results establish fNIRS as an effective tool to investigate cortical contributions to anticipation of effortful behavior. This is especially useful if one requires testing large samples (e.g., to target individual differences), populations with contraindication for functional MRI (e.g., infants or patients with metal implants), or subjects in more naturalistic environments (e.g., work or sport)."
