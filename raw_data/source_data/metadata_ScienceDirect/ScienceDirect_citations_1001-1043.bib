abstract = "Background
Pediatric anxiety disorders, although highly prevalent, are understudied with little known about their pathophysiology. Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a trait associated with worry, a key characteristic of these disorders. Neural responses to uncertainty in healthy subjects involve the same frontal–limbic circuits that are hyper-responsive in pediatric anxiety. As such, the present study examines the relationship between IU and neural responses to uncertainty in anxious adolescents.
Methods
Sixteen adolescents (ages 13–17) diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and/or social phobia (ANX) and 13 non-anxious control subjects completed a decision-making task while functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired.
Results
The ANX group endorsed greater task-related anxiety and less certainty than control subjects on a post-task questionnaire. Compared with control subjects, the ANX group did not demonstrate hyper-responsivity of brain regions as hypothesized. Across groups, IU was positively correlated with activity in several frontal and limbic regions. Further analyses identified subgroups within the ANX group: those with high IU activated frontal/limbic regions, whereas those with low IU and less anxiety during the task deactivated the same regions in response to uncertainty.
Conclusions
Results substantiate the hypothesized link between IU and neural responses to uncertainty in some adolescents with anxiety disorders. Our findings, if replicated, suggest that trait measures, such as IU, can significantly improve our understanding of the neurobiological basis of pediatric anxiety disorders."

abstract = "Summary
One of the major problems in modern medicine is to find remedies for the group of people with chronic pain syndromes. Low back pain is one of the most frequent syndromes and perhaps the most invalidating of all of them. Chronic pain seems to develop through several pathways affecting the spinal cord and the brain: (1) neuro-anatomical reorganisation, (2) neuro-physiological changes, and (3) activation of glia cells (immune reaction in the central nervous system). Although all of these pathways seem to provide a (partial) plausible explanation for chronic pain, treatments influencing these pathways often fail to alleviate chronic pain patients. This could be because of the probability that chronic pain develops by all three mechanisms of disease. A treatment influencing just one of these mechanisms can only be partially successful. Other factors that seem to contribute to the development of chronic pain are psychosocial. Fear, attention and anxiety are part of the chronic pain syndrome being cause or consequence. The three pathways and the psycho-emotional factors constitute a psycho-neuro-immunological substrate for chronic pain syndromes; a substrate which resembles the substrate for phantom pain and functional invalidity after stroke. Both phantom pain and functional invalidity are considered non-use syndromes. The similarity of the substrate of both these two neurological disorders and chronic pain makes it reasonable to consider chronic pain a non-use disease (the hypothesis). To test this hypothesis, we developed a “paradoxal pain therapy”. A therapy which combines the constraint induced movement therapy and strategies to dissociate pain from conditioning factors like fear, anxiety and attention. The aim of the therapy is to establish a behaviour perpendicular on the pathological pain-behaviour. Clinically, the treatment seems promising, although we just have preliminary results. Further clinical and laboratory studies are needed to measure eventual changes at neuro-anatomical and neuro-psychological level using modern neuro-imaging instruments (PET, SPECT, fMRI). Randomised clinical trials should be carried out to test our hypothesis for all-day use in clinical practice. The hypothesis: chronic pain is a non-use disease produced by psycho-emotional factors like fear, attention and anxiety. Optimal treatment should be based on physiological use, and dissociation of pain and the mentioned psycho-emotional factors. Paradoxal pain therapy could serve these treatment conditions."

However, the functional neuroanatomy of body dissatisfaction in AN is largely unknown. This study has investigated self-other body-shape comparison to establish neural correlates of body dissatisfaction in patients with AN. 17 women with AN and 18 age and sex-matched healthy control (HC) subjects were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging while comparing themselves with images of slim idealized female bodies (active condition) or viewing images of interior home designs (control condition). Participants were asked to compare their body shape or room design with those presented. Patients with AN (in comparison to the HC group) showed greater anxiety to the self-other body-shape comparison, and they were less satisfied with their current body shape. In the patient group (in comparison to the HC group) the self-other body-shape comparison induced more activation of the right sensorimotor brain regions (insula, premotor cortex) and less activation of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Insula hyperactivation along with ACC hypoactivation may be critical for altered interoceptive awareness to body self-comparison and/or for altered implicit motivation to thin-idealized body images in AN patients."

Based on an analogous dissociation observed in vision, we expected that autistics’ auditory behavior with respect to complex sound processing may result from atypical activity in non-primary auditory cortex. We employed fMRI to explore the neural basis of complex non-social sound processing in 15 autistic and 13 non-autistics, using a factorial design in which auditory stimuli varied in spectral and temporal complexity. Spectral complexity was modulated by varying the harmonic content, whereas temporal complexity was modulated by varying frequency modulation depth. The detection task was performed similarly by autistics and non-autistics. In both groups, increasing spectral or temporal complexity was associated with activity increases in primary (Heschl's gyrus) and non-primary (anterolateral and posterior superior temporal gyrus) auditory cortex Activity was right-lateralized for spectral and left-lateralized for temporal complexity. Increasing temporal complexity was associated with greater activity in anterolateral superior temporal gyrus in non-autistics and greater effects in Heschl's gyrus in autistics. While we observed similar hierarchical functional organization for auditory processing in both groups, autistics exhibited diminished activity in non-primary auditory cortex and increased activity in primary auditory cortex in response to the presentation of temporally, but not of spectrally complex sounds. Greater temporal complexity effects in regions sensitive to acoustic features and reduced temporal complexity effects in regions sensitive to more abstract sound features could represent a greater focus towards perceptual aspects of speech sounds in autism."

Review of Personal and Social Psychology 14, 151–177) that the automatic, mostly unconscious component of this process, called ‘primitive emotional contagion’, is repeatable and fast, that stronger facial expressions of the sender evoke stronger emotions in the viewer and that women are more susceptible to emotional contagion than men. We presented photos from the Pictures of Facial Affect (Ekman and Friesen, 1976). (Pictures of Facial Affect. Consulting Psychologists Press, Palo Alto) on a PC varying the affective content (happy and sad), the expressive strength and the duration of presentation. After each photo, subjects rated the strength of experienced happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, surprise, fear and pleasure. Feelings of happiness or sadness were significantly, specifically and repeatedly evoked in the viewer — even with presentations lasting only 500 ms. Stronger expressions evoked more emotion. The gender of the viewer had weak effects. We hypothesize that this fast and repeatable reaction is likely to have a ‘prewired’ neural basis. We propose that the induction of emotional processes within a subject by the perception of emotionally expressive faces is a powerful instrument in the detection of emotional states in others and as the basis for one's own reactions. Detailed knowledge of emotional reactions to faces is also valuable as a basis for psychiatric studies of disorders in affect and/or communication and in studies using functional imaging (fMRI or PET) where faces are increasingly used as stimuli."

Attachment and loss: Vol. 1. Attachment, 2nd ed., Basic Books, New York). The capacity for emotion regulation varies with attachment style, such that attachment-anxious individuals become highly emotional when threatened with social rejection or relationship loss, whereas avoidant individuals tend to distance themselves or disengage from emotional situations. In the present study, 20 women participated in an fMRI experiment in which they thought about—and were asked to stop thinking about—various relationship scenarios. When they thought about negative ones (conflict, breakup, death of partner), their level of attachment anxiety was positively correlated with activation in emotion-related areas of the brain (e.g., the anterior temporal pole, implicated in sadness) and inversely correlated with activation in a region associated with emotion regulation (orbitofrontal cortex). This suggests that anxious people react more strongly than non-anxious people to thoughts of loss while under-recruiting brain regions normally used to down-regulate negative emotions. Participants high on avoidance failed to show as much deactivation as less avoidant participants in two brain regions (subcallosal cingulate cortex; lateral prefrontal cortex). This suggests that the avoidant peoples' suppression was less complete or less efficient, in line with results from previous behavioral experiments. These are among the first findings to identify some of the neural processes underlying adult attachment orientations and emotion regulation."

The purpose of this study was to elucidate the neural basis for these deficits in FTD. We studied patients with two different presentations: Three patients with Progressive Non-Fluent Ahasia (PNFA), and five non-aphasic patients with a dysexecutive and social impairment (EXEC). The FTD patient subgroups were compared to a cohort of 11 healthy seniors with intact sentence comprehension. We monitored regional cerebral activity with blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while subjects read sentences featuring both a grammatically complex object-relative center-embedded clause and a long linkage between the head noun phrase (NP) and the gap where the NP is interpreted in the center-embedded clause. Subjects decided whether the agent of the action is a male or a female. Healthy seniors activated both ventral portions of inferior frontal cortex (vIFC) and dorsal portions of IFC (dIFC) in the left hemisphere, often associated with grammatical and working memory components of these sentences, respectively. PNFA patients differed from healthy controls since they have reduced activation of left vIFC, while EXEC patients have less recruitment of left dIFC. We conclude that FTD subgroups have distinct patterns of sentence comprehension difficulty in part because of selective interruptions of a large-scale neural network for sentence processing."

To what extent does imagining the other differs from imagining oneself in similar painful situations? In this functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment, participants were shown pictures of people with their hands or feet in painful or non-painful situations and instructed to imagine and rate the level of pain perceived from different perspectives. Both the Self's and the Other's perspectives were associated with activation in the neural network involved in pain processing, including the parietal operculum, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; BA32) and anterior insula. However, the Self-perspective yielded higher pain ratings and involved the pain matrix more extensively in the secondary somatosensory cortex, the ACC (BA 24a′/24b′), and the insula proper. Adopting the perspective of the Other was associated with specific increase in the posterior cingulate/precuneus and the right temporo-parietal junction. These results show the similarities between Self- and Other-pain representation, but most interestingly they also highlight some distinctiveness between these two representations, which is a crucial aspect of human empathy. It may be what allows us to distinguish empathic responses to others versus our own personal distress. These findings are consistent with the view that empathy does not involve a complete Self–Other merging."

In patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), pain amplification and hypervigilance might result from altered affective-motivational modulation of the pain response. We investigated the effects of emotional context on the behavioral and neural response to visceral stimuli in IBS patients.
Methods
We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess the blood oxygen level-dependent response to nonpainful and painful rectal distensions in 15 female IBS patients and 12 healthy women. Distensions were delivered during psychologic stress or relaxation; data were compared with those in a neutral condition (control). Group and context-dependent differences in the processing of visceral stimulation were assessed at behavioral and the neuronal levels. Secondary analyses of group differences were performed using anxiety scores as a covariate because of higher anxiety symptoms among patients with IBS.
Results
During rectal stimulation, IBS patients demonstrated more pronounced stress-induced modulation of neural activation in multiple brain regions, including the insula, midcingulate cortex, and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. In response to relaxation, IBS patients demonstrated reduced modulation of distension-induced activation in the insula. During relaxation, the difference observed between groups could be accounted for by higher anxiety symptoms in patients with IBS; differential effects of stress in the insula and prefrontal regions were not attributable to anxiety.
Conclusions
IBS patients appear to have disrupted emotional modulation of neural responses to visceral stimuli, possibly reflecting the neural basis for altered visceral interoception by stress and negative emotions."

Newborns' visual preference for schematic face-like stimuli has been recently related to a sensitivity for visual patterns with a greater number of elements in the upper compared to the lower part. At the adult level, neuroimaging studies have identified a network of cortical areas devoted to the detection and identification of faces. However, whether and how low-level structural properties of face stimuli contribute to the preferential response to faces in these areas remain to be clarified. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), here we investigated whether the adults' face-sensitive cortical areas show a preference for top-heavy patterns, similarly to newborns' preference. Twelve participants were presented with head-shaped and square patterns with either more elements in the upper or the lower vertical part. In the right fusiform gyrus (‘fusiform face area’, FFA), an area showing a preference for faces over other visual object categories, there was a larger activation for curvilinear patterns with more high-contrast elements in the upper part, even though these patterns were not perceived as face stimuli. These findings provide direct evidence that the FFA is tuned for geometrical properties fitting best with the structure of faces, a computational mechanism that might drive the automatic detection of faces in the visual world."

Here we investigated the degree to which activity in the STS and other brain regions is modulated by the context of the perceived gaze shift; that is, when the shift correctly or incorrectly acquires a visual target. Fifteen subjects participated in an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment in which they viewed an animated face that remained present throughout each run. On each of 21 trials within each run, a small checkerboard appeared and flickered at one of six locations within the character’s visual field. On “correct” trials, the character shifted its gaze towards the checkerboard after a delay of 1 or 3s. On “incorrect” trials, the character shifted its gaze towards empty space after the same delays. On “no shift” trials, the character’s eyes did not move. Significantly larger hemodynamic responses (HDR) were evoked by gaze shifts compared to no gaze shifts in primarily right hemisphere STS. The gaze-evoked HDR was significantly delayed in peak amplitude for 3s compared to 1s shifts. For 1s shifts, a strong effect of context was observed in which errors evoked a HDR with extended duration. Although this study focused upon STS, similar effects were also observed in the intraparietal sulcus and fusiform gyrus."

The default-mode network (DMN) is a prominent network which includes the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), medial temporal lobes (MTL), and angular gyrus (AG). Despite increasing interest in DMN function, little is known about its maturation from childhood to adulthood. Here we examine developmental changes in DMN connectivity using a multimodal imaging approach by combining resting-state fMRI, voxel-based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging-based tractography. We found that the DMN undergoes significant developmental changes in functional and structural connectivity, but these changes are not uniform across all DMN nodes. Convergent structural and functional connectivity analyses suggest that PCC-mPFC connectivity along the cingulum bundle is the most immature link in the DMN of children. Both PCC and mPFC also showed gray matter volume differences, as well as prominent macrostructural and microstructural differences in the dorsal cingulum bundle linking these regions. Notably, structural connectivity between PCC and left MTL was either weak or non-existent in children, even though functional connectivity did not differ from that of adults. These results imply that functional connectivity in children can reach adult-like levels despite weak structural connectivity. We propose that maturation of PCC-mPFC structural connectivity plays an important role in the development of self-related and social-cognitive functions that emerge during adolescence. More generally, our study demonstrates how quantitative multimodal analysis of anatomy and connectivity allows us to better characterize the heterogeneous development and maturation of brain networks."

Consistent with previous work, during both the EMO and ID tasks, we found a significant increase in activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) supporting its generalized role in WM. Further, individuals that showed greater DLPFC activity during both tasks also showed increased amygdala activity during the EMO task and increased lateral fusiform gyrus activity during the ID task. Importantly, the level of activity in these regions significantly correlated with performance on the respective tasks. These findings provide support for two separate neural circuitries, both involving the DLPFC, supporting working memory for the faces and expressions of others."

Il est maintenant admis qu’à côté du traitement des symptômes positifs et négatifs de la schizophrénie, on doit également se préoccuper d’améliorer les troubles cognitifs des patients. En effet, le déficit cognitif est désormais reconnu comme un élément majeur de l’insertion sociale et professionnelle des patients schizophrènes. Les antipsychotiques conventionnels n’améliorent pas la cognition et induisent des effets indésirables. Les antipsychotiques atypiques quant à eux présentent moins d’effets indésirables et améliorent la cognition. Néanmoins, si l’on veut bien interpréter les résultats reliés aux performances durant un traitement il faut considérer l’effet de pratique. Cet effet peut être lié à la mémoire procédurale, c’est-à-dire l’apprentissage implicite, qui est sensible aux blocages des récepteurs dopaminergiques D2. La mesure des performances cognitives n’est toutefois pas bien encore considérée par les cliniciens, malgré les données scientifiques probantes. Cela réclame que l’on confronte ces données à la validité écologique des mesures. Nous décrivons des exemples dans ce domaine auprès de patients schizophrènes évalués à l’aide de tâches de la vie quotidienne. Enfin nous rendons compte des progrès de l’évaluation des plaintes subjectives des patients à l’égard de leur fonctionnement cognitif en donnant l’exemple du SSTICS, instrument développé en français pour aborder cette subjectivité reliée à l’insight.
Summary
Background
In this review, we conclude that cognitive impairments are as important as positive and negative symptoms in the clinical assessment and management of patients with schizophrenia. This is not a comprehensive review, considering that the new Measurement And Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) model will soon provide valuable data. It is however a product of the collective efforts of a French Canadian clinical research team that proposes a synthesis of data of pragmatic interest to clinicians. Medication with improved safety and cognition profile, generally lead to better outcomes by facilitating compliance with drug regimens and rehabilitation programs. In addition, measures of attention and executive function (EF) appear to improve with novel antipsychotics when compared to traditional neuroleptics. Nevertheless, evaluating cognitive performance is not a routine procedure outside the domain of research. For example, procedural learning (PL) – an important measure of cognitive function–refers to cognitive and motor learning processes in which execution strategies cannot be explicitly described (ie learning by doing). These actions or procedures are then progressively learned through trial and error until automation of optimal performance is established. Procedural learning is rarely assessed in clinical practice. Inconsistent findings regarding the effects of neuroleptic drugs on PL have been reported.
Literature findings
rials using acute administration of chlorpromazine in normal subjects induced PL deficits, suggesting the direct effect of neuroleptics, presumably via a D2 dopamine blockade in the striatum. In a recent study by our group, schizophrenia patients, divided into three groups according to their pharmacological treatment (halopéridol, clozapine and rispéridone) were compared to normal controls on two PL tasks ; a visuomotor learning task (mirror drawing) and a problem solving learning task (Tower of Toronto). No deficits were detected in patients receiving clozapine, while haloperidol was associated with deleterious effects in both tasks. Risperidone, however, produced different effects depending on the task performed. Another 6-month double-blind Canadian study confirmed the beneficial effect of olanzapine on PL compared to haloperidol and risperidone. The differential effects of drugs on the striatal D2 receptors, irrespective of their classification as conventional or atypical neuroleptics and the specific process implicated in each of these PL tasks may explain these results. Tracer studies using radioactive benzamides (IBZM) specific to striatal D2 receptors determined a relationship between striatal D2 receptor occupancy and PL performance such as the mirror drawing task. Using this method, data obtained in Montreal on schizophrenia patients receiving olanzapine and halopéridol have shown that the coefficient of determination in a visumotor PL task varied inversely with D receptor saturation.
Discussion
This review probes the effect of impaired cognitive functions on schizophrenia patients’ quality of life. Cognitive deficits found in schizophrenia affect planning, along with the aptitude to initiate and regulate a goal-directed behaviour. These impairments have been repeatedly, yet inconclusively, attributed to frontal lobe dysfunction. Morphological findings obtained from neuroima-ging studies remain inconsistent, some noting no differences between patients and controls while others observing reduced prefrontal volumes in schizophrenia patients. Conversely, functional neuroimaging (fMRI) demonstrated reduced frontal blood flow relative to global cerebral perfusion in schizophrenia patients. Overall, neuroimaging literature provides reliable evidence of frontal impairments in schizophrenia, atthough the average magnitude of difference between patients and controls is insufficient to defend a frontal lobe dysfunction hypo-thesis, as far as brain volume, resting cerebral metabolism or blood flow are concerned. The only measurement clearly distinguishing between patients and controls is fMRI of the frontal lobe while performing an experimentally controlled task. Here, schizophrenia patients fail to activate their frontal cortex when required. Sensitive to frontal lobe dysfunction are Neuropsychological tests of executive function.
Study design
A study conducted in Montreal assessed the relation between EF impairments and difficulties in planning daily activities in schizophrenia patients scoring more than 3 on at least 4 items of the PANSS negative subscale. Performances on EF, memory and script generation were measured and compared to controls. Script production task required that subjects recite 10-20 actions that would normally be carried out for during daily life activity (going to a restaurant, buying groceries, etc.). Patients’ performances were significantly lower with higher perserveration and sequencing impairments. Routine activities such as the ability to cook a meal were similarly investigated. Patients were videotaped in a kitchen while preparing a specific meal.
Results
Optimal sequence of micro- and macro-steps necessary to prepare the meal in a minimal time were measured. Sequencing errors, repetitions and omissions were significantly higher compared to controls. In addition, temporal organization was positively correlated with negative symptoms and low EF performance on neuro-psychological tasks. Thus concluding that EF impairment interferes with basic routine activities in schizophrenia patients, notably those with negative symptoms. Last but not least, we assessed the progress of patients’ subjective complaints with regards to their cognitive functions using tests such as the SSTICS, specifically developed to address subjective cognitive complaints and insight.
Conclusion
This review concludes that from now on cognitive deficit should be recognized as a major element in social and professional integration of schizophrenia patients, and should become a standardized assessment approach in clinical practice."

Despite the importance of face processing for normal social development, no functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of face processing in autism have focused exclusively on the childhood years. To fill this gap, 45 children aged 6–12 participated in practice scans. After exclusion due to motion, 11 children with an ASD and 11 age-matched normal control subjects were included in final analyses.
Methods
Stimuli consisted of pictures of a familiar adult, familiar child, stranger adult, stranger child, and objects. During the scan, children pressed a button in response to an identical face shown on two consecutive trials. On the basis of our prior research, masks of four anatomic regions of interest (ROIs) including the fusiform gyrus, amygdala, and anterior and posterior cingulate were created for each subject and manually edited for anatomic precision. Following deconvolution analyses, the number of voxels significantly active and percent signal change values that fell within each ROI mask were calculated for each subject.
Results
Analyses revealed normal fusiform activity in children with autism when viewing a face of their mother or other children. In contrast, looking at stranger adult faces initiated profound deficits in that the mean number of significantly active voxels in the fusiform bilaterally was approximately 25% of that shown in typically developing children.
Conclusions
A selective fusiform deficit in response only to the faces of adult strangers may be the result of reduced attention and interest during those conditions. Face processing abnormalities found in autism beyond the fusiform likely exist."

In this initial functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, eight adolescents with aggressive CD and eight matched controls with no CD symptoms were scanned while watching animated visual stimuli depicting other people experiencing pain or not experiencing pain. Furthermore, these situations involved either an individual whose pain was caused by accident or an individual whose pain was inflicted on purpose by another person. After scanning, participants rated how painful the situations were. In both groups the perception of others in pain was associated with activation of the pain matrix, including the ACC, insula, somatosensory cortex, supplementary motor area and periaqueductal gray. The pain matrix was activated to a specific extent in participants with CD, who also showed significantly greater amygdala, striatal, and temporal pole activation. When watching situations in which pain was intentionally inflicted, control youth exhibited signal increase in the medial prefrontal cortex, lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and right temporo-parietal junction, whereas youth with CD only exhibited activation in the insula and precentral gyrus. Furthermore, connectivity analyses demonstrated that youth with CD exhibited less amygdala/prefrontal coupling when watching pain inflicted by another than did control youth. These preliminary findings suggest that youth with aggressive CD exhibit an atypical pattern of neural response to viewing others in pain that should be explored in further studies."

Although the amygdala is composed of multiple anatomically and functionally distinct nuclei, typical structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences are unable to discern them. Thus, functional MRI (fMRI) studies typically average the BOLD response over the entire structure, which reveals some aspects of amygdala function as a whole but does not distinguish the separate roles of specific nuclei in humans. We developed a method to segment the human amygdala into its four major nuclei using only diffusion-weighted imaging and connectivity patterns derived mainly from animal studies. We refer to this new method as Tractography-based Segmentation, or TractSeg. The segmentations derived from TractSeg were topographically similar to their corresponding amygdaloid nuclei, and were validated against a high-resolution scan in which the nucleic boundaries were visible. In addition, nuclei topography was consistent across subjects. TractSeg relies on short scan acquisitions and widely accessible software packages, making it attractive for use in healthy populations to explore normal amygdala nucleus function, as well as in clinical and pediatric populations. Finally, it paves the way for implementing this method in other anatomical regions which are also composed of functional subunits that are difficult to distinguish with standard structural MRI."

A central hypothesis, with some empirical support, is that face-selective regions in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) are particularly responsive to dynamic information in faces, whereas the fusiform face area (FFA) computes the static or invariant properties of faces. Here we directly tested this hypothesis by measuring the magnitude of response in each region to both dynamic and static stimuli. Consistent with the hypothesis, we found that the response to movies of faces was not significantly different from the response to static images of faces from these same movies in the right FFA and right occipital face area (OFA). By contrast the face-selective region in the right posterior STS (pSTS) responded nearly three times as strongly to dynamic faces as to static faces, and a face-selective region in the right anterior STS (aSTS) responded to dynamic faces only. Both of these regions also responded more strongly to moving faces than to moving bodies, indicating that they are preferentially engaged in processing dynamic information from faces, not in more general processing of any dynamic social stimuli. The response to dynamic and static faces was not significantly different in a third face-selective region in the posterior continuation of the STS (pcSTS). The strong selectivity of face-selective regions in the pSTS and aSTS, but not the FFA, OFA or pcSTS, for dynamic face information demonstrates a clear functional dissociation between different face-selective regions, and provides further clues into their function."

The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is critical for learning-related synaptic plasticity in amygdala and hippocampus. As a consequence, there is considerable interest in drugs targeting this receptor to help enhance amygdala- and hippocampus-dependent learning. A promising candidate in this respect is the NMDAR glycine-binding site partial agonist D-cycloserine (DCS). Accumulating clinical evidence indicates the efficacy of DCS in the facilitation of amygdala-dependent fear extinction learning in patients with phobic, social anxiety, panic, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. An important unresolved question though is whether the use of DCS can also facilitate hippocampus-dependent declarative learning in healthy people as opposed to being restricted to the fear memory domain.
Methods
In the present study, we investigated whether or not DCS can facilitate hippocampus-dependent declarative learning. We have therefore combined functional magnetic resonance imaging with two different declarative learning tasks and cytoarchitectonic probabilistic mapping of the hippocampus and its major subdivisions in 40 healthy volunteers administered either a 250 mg single oral dose of DCS or a placebo.
Results
We found that DCS facilitates declarative learning as well as blood-oxygen level dependent activity levels in the probabilistically defined cornu ammonis region of the hippocampus. The absence of activity changes in visual control areas underscores the specific action of DCS in the hippocampal cornu ammonis region.
Conclusions
Our findings highlight NMDAR glycine-binding site partial agonism as a promising pharmacological mechanism for facilitating declarative learning in healthy people."

Comorbidity between schizophrenia and psychopathy has been noted in violent patients in forensic settings. Both disorders are characterized by deficits in processing sad and fearful emotions, but there have been no imaging studies examining the impact of comorbid psychopathic traits on emotional information processing in violent patients with schizophrenia. We tested the hypothesis that violent patients with schizophrenia who had high psychopathy scores would show attenuated amygdala responses to emotional (particularly fearful) faces compared with those with low psychopathy scores.
Methods
Twenty-four violent male patients with schizophrenia were categorized as high/low scorers based on the Psychopathy Checklist: Screening Version. Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during a block-designed implicit face affect processing task. In a region of interest approach, responses in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex were examined with contrasts between sad/fearful/angry/disgusted faces and neutral faces.
Results
High psychopathy scorers exhibited reduced blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses in the amygdala during exposure to fearful faces. Psychopathy scores, particularly the affective facets, correlated negatively with amygdala responses. The BOLD responses in the orbitofrontal cortex were negatively correlated with the lifestyle and antisocial facets of psychopathy during exposure to sad faces. Psychopathy scores were positively correlated with neural activation in amygdala and inferior prefrontal regions for disgust but negatively correlated for anger.
Conclusions
Patients with schizophrenia and high levels of psychopathic traits appear to have blunted amygdala responses to fearful faces. At a dimensional level, psychopathy subfacets show a differential relationship to functioning in amygdala-prefrontal circuitry."

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to identify brain regions involved in the recognition of newly learned faces. Two experiments were conducted.

Experiment 2 compared a fixation control with another face recognition task in which subjects were presented with both novel and viewed faces (half-target). Compared to the fixation control, the all-target face recognition was associated with activation in the bilateral occipital and occipitotemporal regions, whereas the half-target face recognition produced activation in the right parietal and prefrontal regions, in addition to the occipital and occipitotemporal. The all-target minus half-target comparison revealed significant activation in the bilateral fusiform gyrus, suggesting stronger fusiform activity during the all-target than the half-target face recognition. The half-target minus all-target comparison showed significant activation in the superior and inferior parietal lobules and several regions in the right frontal lobe. These findings demonstrated that the bilateral fusiform gyrus is involved, not only in face perception, but in a certain aspect of face recognition memory and that this aspect is related to the actual recognition of previously viewed faces rather than the processing of novel ones, which results are consistent with previous lesion work. The right parietal and frontal regions, in contrast, are differentially more associated with the processes related to the detection of novel faces or retrieval effort."

Les difficultés du contrôle cognitif et de l’inhibition sont souvent rapportées dans la littérature sur le TDAH.

Les résultats de plusieurs études en neuro-imagerie, neuropsychologie, génétique et neurochimie convergent vers l’implication d’une dysfonction du réseau neuronal frontostriatal comme cause probable du TDAH (4, 8, 16, 17, 18). Ces dysfonctions se retrouvent dans des régions comme le cortex préfrontal dorsolatéral et ventrolatéral, le cortex cingulaire dorsoantérieur et le néostriatum. L’étude de ces régions, ainsi que du corps calleux et du cervelet, est aujourd’hui plus facilement réalisable grâce à l’imagerie par résonance magnétique fonctionnelle (IRMf) et structurelle.

Summary
Introduction
Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common and impairing neuropsychiatric disorder with preschool onset. ADHD occurs in approximately 3–9% of the childhood population. There is a much higher incidence rate in boys who are around three times more likely than girls to be diagnosed. Approximately 30–60% of individuals diagnosed with ADHD in youth have symptoms that persist into adulthood.
Literature findings
Three subtypes of the disorder have been proposed in the current clinical view of ADHD: inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive and combined type. Numerous problems are associated with ADHD: poor academic performance, learning disorders, subtle cognitive deficits, conduct disorders, antisocial personality disorder, poor social relationships, and a higher incidence of anxiety and depression symptoms into adulthood. Researchers have emphasized poor behavioural inhibition as the central impairment of the disorder. From the neuropsychological viewpoint, impairment of the “hot” affective aspects of executive functions, like behavioural inhibition and attention and the more cognitive, “cool” aspects of executive functions like self-regulation, working memory, planning, and cognitive flexibility, are often reported by studies on ADHD. The hot executive functions are associated with ventral and medial regions of the prefrontal cortex (including the anterior cingulated cortex) and named “hotbrain” and the cool executive functions are associated with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and are called “coolbrain”.
Discussion
Convergent data from neuroimaging, neuropsychology, genetics and neurochemical studies consistently point to the involvement of the frontostriatal network as a likely contributor to the pathophysiology of ADHD. This network involves the lateral prefrontal cortex, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, the caudate nucleus and putamen. Moreover, a growing literature demonstrates abnormalities affecting other cortical regions and the cerebellum. The exploratory brain regions of interest in which abnormalities have been identified, but that were not predicted by cognitive models of ADHD, are the temporal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe and lateral ventricles. Anatomical studies suggest widespread reductions in volume throughout the cerebrum and cerebellum, while functional imaging studies suggest that affected individuals activate more diffuse areas than controls during the performance of cognitive tasks. More precisely, reductions in volume have been observed in the total cerebral volume, the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia (striatum), the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, the corpus callosum and the cerebellum. Furthermore, hypoactivation of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, the frontal cortex and the basal ganglia (striatum) have also been reported. The paradigms mostly used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are tasks of motor inhibition, interference and attention such as the go/no-go, “stop-signal” and the Stroop.
Conclusion
This review provides an overview of the main imaging studies that investigated the neurobiological substrate of ADHD. Some guidelines for future functional magnetic imaging studies are also suggested."

abstract = "Humans are the only species known to use whispering for communication, and humans are also the only species known to suffer from functional (psychological) aphonia, a condition in which only whispered and not vocalized speech can be produced. Thus, whispering is uniquely a human function and psychological aphonia is uniquely a human dysfunction; both can be considered to result from human evolution. We hypothesize that the human brain has developed one or more identifiable switching mechanisms that overlay whispering onto the mechanisms of normal speech production. Thus, for whispering the speech production system operates as for normal speech production, but the switch to whispering activates the laryngeal abductor muscle (and possibly the inferior pharyngeal constrictor) so that the larynx does not completely adduct and turbulence noise is produced at the larynx. We hypothesize that psychological aphonia results from involuntary or subconscious activation of this switching mechanism. Preliminary research leads us to hypothesize that there are two switching mechanisms. This research used functional magnetic-resonance imaging to contrast brain activity for both normal speech and whispering (versus silence) for normally phonic subjects in an imagined social situation. One pattern of results involved a decrease of overall activity for whispering, with possible activation of the corpus callosum, and possible crossover of the main locus of activation from the dominant to the nondominant side. The other involved increased overall activity for whispering versus normal voice, accompanied by an increase of activity in the frontal cortex. More participants exhibited the former pattern than the latter one. These results may be related to the fact that there are actually two types of psychological aphonia, one that occurs after bouts of severe coughing associated with lower-respiratory disorders and the other due to purely psychological factors. We hypothesize that these are associated with the two different switching mechanisms, an upper one associated with the conscious brain and a lower one associated with more basic functions such as protecting the vocal folds. Understanding brain mechanisms for voluntary whispering and relating them to the occurrence of dysphonia has obvious implications for improving clinical assessment and treatment of aphonia, and would also contribute to improved understanding of human function in general."

Separate neural systems have been implicated in the recognition of facial identity (mainly extrastriate visual cortex) and emotional expression (limbic areas and the superior temporal sulcus). Working-memory (WM) studies with faces have shown different but partly overlapping activation patterns in comparison to spatial WM in parietal and prefrontal areas. However, little is known about the neural representations of the different facial dimensions during WM. In the present study 22 subjects performed a face-identity or face-emotion WM task at different load levels during functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found a fronto-parietal-visual WM-network for both tasks during maintenance, including fusiform gyrus. Limbic areas in the amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus demonstrated a stronger activation for the identity than the emotion condition. One explanation for this finding is that the repetitive presentation of faces with different identities but the same emotional expression during the identity-task is responsible for the stronger increase in BOLD signal in the amygdala. These results raise the question how different emotional expressions are coded in WM. Our findings suggest that emotional expressions are re-coded in an abstract representation that is supported at the neural level by the canonical fronto-parietal WM network."

However, the comparison of different appraisal levels has so far relied upon using linguistic instructions during low-level processing, which might confound effects of processing level and linguistic task. In order to circumvent this problem, we examined processing of emotional prosody in meaningless speech during gender labelling (implicit, low-level appraisal) and emotion labelling (explicit, high-level appraisal). While bilateral amygdala, left superior temporal sulcus and right parietal areas showed stronger blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses during implicit processing, areas with stronger BOLD responses during explicit processing included the left inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral parietal, anterior cingulate and supplemental motor cortex. Emotional versus neutral prosody evoked BOLD responses in right superior temporal gyrus, bilateral anterior cingulate, left inferior frontal gyrus, insula and bilateral putamen. Basal ganglia and right anterior cingulate responses to emotional versus neutral prosody were particularly pronounced during explicit processing. These results are in line with an amygdala-prefrontal-cingulate network controlling different appraisal levels, and suggest a specific role of the left inferior frontal gyrus in explicit evaluation of emotional prosody. In addition to brain areas commonly related to prosody processing, our results suggest specific functions of anterior cingulate and basal ganglia in detecting emotional prosody, particularly when explicit identification is necessary."

abstract = "Background
Difficulties in emotion processing and poor social function are common to bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) depression, resulting in many BD depressed individuals being misdiagnosed with MDD. The amygdala is a key region implicated in processing emotionally salient stimuli, including emotional facial expressions. It is unclear, however, whether abnormal amygdala activity during positive and negative emotion processing represents a persistent marker of BD regardless of illness phase or a state marker of depression common or specific to BD and MDD depression.
Methods
Sixty adults were recruited: 15 depressed with BD type 1 (BDd), 15 depressed with recurrent MDD, 15 with BD in remission (BDr), diagnosed with DSM-IV and Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Research Version criteria; and 15 healthy control subjects (HC). Groups were age- and gender ratio-matched; patient groups were matched for age of illness onset and illness duration; depressed groups were matched for depression severity. The BDd were taking more psychotropic medication than other patient groups. All individuals participated in three separate 3T neuroimaging event-related experiments, where they viewed mild and intense emotional and neutral faces of fear, happiness, or sadness from a standardized series.
Results
The BDd—relative to HC, BDr, and MDD—showed elevated left amygdala activity to mild and neutral facial expressions in the sad (p < .009) but not other emotion experiments that was not associated with medication. There were no other significant between-group differences in amygdala activity.
Conclusions
Abnormally elevated left amygdala activity to mild sad and neutral faces might be a depression-specific marker in BD but not MDD, suggesting different pathophysiologic processes for BD versus MDD depression."

Fragile X (FraX) syndrome is caused by mutations of the FraX mental retardation-1 gene—a gene responsible for producing FraX mental retardation protein. The neurocognitive phenotype associated with FraX in female subjects includes increased risk for emotional disorders including social anxiety, depression, and attention deficit. Here, the authors investigated the neurobiological systems underlying emotion attribution in female subjects with FraX syndrome.
Method
While undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging, 10 high-functioning female subjects with FraX syndrome and 10 typically developing (TD) female subjects were presented with photographs of happy, sad, and neutral faces and instructed to determine the facial emotion.
Results
No significant group differences were found for the recognition of happy faces, although the FraX group showed a trend toward a significant difference for the recognition of sad faces and significantly poorer recognition of neutral faces. Controlling for between-group differences in IQ and performance accuracy, the TD group had greater activation than the FraX group in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) for neutral faces compared with scrambled faces and the caudate for sad faces compared with scrambled faces (but not for sad faces compared with neutral faces). In the FraX group, FraX mental retardation protein levels positively correlated with activation in the dorsal ACC for neutral, happy, and sad faces when independently compared with scrambled faces. Significantly greater negative correlation between IQ and insula activation for neutral faces relative to scrambled faces was observed in the FraX group compared with the TD group. Significantly greater positive correlation between IQ and ACC activation for neutral faces relative to scrambled faces was observed in the TD group compared with the FraX group.
Conclusions
Although emotion recognition is generally spared in FraX syndrome, the emotion circuit (i.e., ACC, caudate, insula) that modulates emotional responses to facial stimuli may be disrupted. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry, 2008;47(12):1443-1454."

abstract = "During adolescence, considerable social and biological changes occur that interact with functional brain maturation, some of which are sex-specific. The amygdala is one brain area that has displayed sexual dimorphism, specifically in socio-affective (superficial amygdala [SFA]), stress (centromedial amygdala [CMA]), and learning and memory (basolateral amygdala [BLA]) processing. The amygdala has also been implicated in mood and anxiety disorders which display sex-specific features, most prominently observed during adolescence. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the present study examined the interaction of age and sex on resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) of amygdala sub-regions, BLA and SFA, in a sample of healthy adolescents between the ages 10 and 16years (n=122, 71 boys). Whole-brain, voxel-wise partial correlation analyses were conducted to determine RSFC of bilateral BLA and SFA seed regions, created using the Eickhoff–Zilles maximum probability maps based on cytoarchitectonic mapping and FMRIB's Integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool (FIRST). Monte Carlo simulation was implemented to correct for multiple comparisons (threshold of 53 contiguous voxels with a z-value≥2.25). Results indicated that with increasing age, there was a corresponding decrease in RSFC between both amygdala sub-regions and parieto-occipital cortices, with a concurrent increase in RSFC with medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Specifically, boys and girls demonstrated increased coupling of mPFC and left and right SFA with age, respectively; however, neither sex showed increased connectivity between mPFC and BLA, which could indicate relative immaturity of fronto-limbic networks that is similar across sex. A dissociation in connectivity between BLA- and SFA-parieto-occipital RSFC emerged, in which girls had weaker negative RSFC between SFA and parieto-occipital regions and boys had weaker negative RSFC of BLA and parieto-occipital regions with increased age, both standing in contrast to adult patterns of amygdala sub-regional RSFC. The present findings suggest relative immaturity of amygdala sub-regional RSFC with parieto-occipital cortices during adolescence, with unique patterns in both sexes that may support memory and socio-affective processing in boys and girls, respectively. Understanding the underlying normative functional architecture of brain networks associated with the amygdala during adolescence may better inform future research of the neural features associated with increased risk for internalizing psychopathology."

(ii) Do animals and humans share certain aspects of their core selves, yielding a trans-species concept of self? (iii) What are the neural processes that underlie a possible trans-species concept of self? (iv) What are the developmental aspects and do they result in various levels of self-representation? Drawing on recent literature from both human and animal research, we suggest a trans-species concept of self that is based upon what has been called a “core-self” which can be described by self-related processing (SRP) as a specific mode of interaction between organism and environment. When we refer to specific neural networks, we will here refer to the underlying system as the “core-SELF.” The core-SELF provides primordial neural coordinates that represent organisms as living creatures—at the lowest level this elaborates interoceptive states along with raw emotional feelings (i.e., the intentions in action of a primordial core-SELF) while higher medial cortical levels facilitate affective-cognitive integration (yielding a fully-developed nomothetic core-self). Developmentally, SRP allows stimuli from the environment to be related and linked to organismic needs, signaled and processed within core-self structures within subcorical-cortical midline structures (SCMS) that provide the foundation for epigenetic emergence of ecologically framed, higher idiographic forms of selfhood across different individuals within a species. These functions ultimately operate as a coordinated network. We postulate that core SRP operates automatically, is deeply affective, and is developmentally and epigenetically connected to sensory-motor and higher cognitive abilities. This core-self is mediated by SCMS, embedded in visceral and instinctual representations of the body that are well integrated with basic attentional, emotional and motivational functions that are apparently shared between humans, non-human mammals, and perhaps in a proto-SELF form, other vertebrates. Such a trans-species concept of organismic coherence is thoroughly biological and affective at the lowest levels of a complex neural network, and culturally and ecologically molded at higher levels of neural processing. It allows organisms to selectively adapt to and integrate with physical and social environments. Such a psychobiologically universal, but environmentally diversified, concept may promote novel trans-species studies of the core-self across mammalian species."

Here, we aimed to investigate the neural mechanisms of empathy in ASD, and to explore familial contributions to empathy correlates. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, 15 boys with ASD, 11 fathers of adolescents with ASD, and two control groups comparable for age and IQ (n=15 typically developing boys and their fathers (n=9)) were investigated during an empathy task. Emotional faces were presented and participants were either asked to infer the emotional state from the face (other-task) or to judge their own emotional response to the face (self-task). When attributing emotions to self and other, the ASD group showed diminished fusiform gyrus activation compared to controls. Neural activity in the fusiform gyrus was inversely related to social deficits in ASD subjects. Moreover, when ASD subjects inferred their own emotional response to faces, they showed less congruent reactions and inferior frontal gyrus activity was decreased. Although fathers of ASD children scored higher on a self-rating scale for autistic symptoms compared to control fathers, their task performance was unimpaired. However, neurally, fathers of affected children also showed reduced fusiform gyrus activation when inferring others' emotions. Shared abnormalities in fusiform gyrus activation in affected adolescents and first-degree relatives suggest that this dysfunction constitutes a fundamental deviation in ASD. Moreover, the findings provide evidence that both aberrant neural face and mirroring mechanisms are implicated in empathy impairments in ASD."

Graph theory has been widely applied to characterize the overall structure of data sets in the social, technological, and biological sciences, including neuroscience. Modular structure decomposition enables the definition of sub-networks whose components are gathered in the same module and work together closely, while working weakly with components from other modules. This processing is of interest for studying memory, a cognitive process that is widely distributed. We propose a new method to identify modular structure in task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) networks. The modular structure was obtained directly from correlation coefficients and thus retained information about both signs and weights. The method was applied to functional data acquired during a yes–no odor recognition memory task performed by young and elderly adults. Four response categories were explored: correct (Hit) and incorrect (False alarm, FA) recognition and correct and incorrect rejection. We extracted time series data for 36 areas as a function of response categories and age groups and calculated condition-based weighted correlation matrices. Overall, condition-based modular partitions were more homogeneous in young than elderly subjects. Using partition similarity-based statistics and a posteriori statistical analyses, we demonstrated that several areas, including the hippocampus, caudate nucleus, and anterior cingulate gyrus, belonged to the same module more frequently during Hit than during all other conditions. Modularity values were negatively correlated with memory scores in the Hit condition and positively correlated with bias scores (liberal/conservative attitude) in the Hit and FA conditions. We further demonstrated that the proportion of positive and negative links between areas of different modules (i.e., the proportion of correlated and anti-correlated areas) accounted for most of the observed differences in signed modularity. Taken together, our results provided some evidence that the neural networks involved in odor recognition memory are organized into modules and that these modular partitions are linked to behavioral performance and individual strategies."

We investigated whether the shifts of attention triggered by biologically relevant gaze cues and biologically non-relevant arrow cues rely on the same neural systems by comparing the effects of gaze-cued and arrow-cued orienting on blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal in humans. Participants detected laterally presented reaction signals preceded by centrally presented non-predictive gaze and arrow cues. Directional gaze cues and arrow cues were presented in separate blocks. Furthermore, two separate control blocks were run in which non-directional cues (straight gaze or segment of a line) were used. The BOLD signals during the control blocks were subtracted from those during the respective blocks with directional cues. Behavioral data showed that, for both cue types, reaction times were shorter on congruent than incongruent trials. Imaging data revealed three foci of activation for gaze-cued orienting: in the left inferior occipital gyrus and right medial and inferior occipital gyri. For arrow-cued orienting, a much more extensive network was activated. There were large postcentral activations bilaterally including areas in the medial/inferior occipital gyri and medial temporal gyri and in the left intraparietal area. Interestingly, arrow cuing also activated the right frontal eye field and supplementary eye field. The results suggest that attention orienting by gaze cues and attention orienting by arrow cues are not supported by the same cortical network and that attention orienting by symbolic arrow cues relies on mechanisms associated with voluntary shifts of attention."

Facial emotions are central to human interaction. Identifying pathophysiology in affect processing circuitry that supports the ability to assess facial emotions might facilitate understanding of affect regulation in pediatric bipolar disorder.
Methods
Ten euthymic, unmedicated pediatric bipolar patients and 10 healthy control subjects matched for age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, and IQ were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Angry, happy, and neutral faces were presented in 30-sec blocks, with a 20-sec rest period between blocks. Subjects were asked to press a button when each face appeared, to ensure that attention was maintained on-task.
Results
In bipolar patients, in response to both angry and happy faces relative to neutral faces, we observed reduced activation of right rostral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex together with increased activity in right pregenual anterior cingulate, amygdala, and paralimbic cortex. Bipolar patients also showed reduced activation of visual areas in occipital cortex together with greater activation in higher-order visual perceptual areas, including superior temporal sulcus and fusiform gyrus with angry faces and posterior parietal cortex with happy faces.
Conclusions
Findings document a disturbance in affective neurocircuitry in pediatric bipolar disorder. Reduced activation in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex might reflect diminished top-down control that leads to the observed exaggerated activation in amygdala and paralimbic areas. Changes in occipital areas might represent an effort to gate sensory input when affective responses to the faces could not be successfully modulated. Disturbances in affect processing circuitry could contribute to emotional dysregulation and social cognitive difficulties in bipolar youth."

Thirty-two patients with BC scheduled to receive ChT (pre-ChT+), 33 patients with BC not indicated to undergo ChT (pre-ChT−), and 38 no-cancer controls (NCs) were included. The examination consisted of a neuropsychological test battery, self-reported aspects of psychosocial functioning, and multimodal MRI. Patients with BC reported worse scores on several aspects of quality of life, such as higher levels of fatigue and stress. However, cortisol levels were not elevated in the patient groups compared to the control group. Overall cognitive performance was lower in the pre-ChT+ and the pre-ChT− groups compared to NC. Further, patients demonstrated prefrontal hyperactivation with increasing task difficulty on a planning task compared to NC, but not during a memory task. White matter integrity was lower in both patient groups. No differences in regional brain volume and brain metabolites were found. The cognitive and imaging data converged to show that symptoms of fatigue were associated with the observed abnormalities; the observed differences were no longer significant when fatigue was accounted for. This study suggests that cancer-related psychological or biological processes may adversely impact cognitive functioning and associated aspects of brain structure and function before the start of adjuvant treatment. Our findings stress the importance to further explore the processes underlying the expression of fatigue and to study whether it has a contributory role in subsequent treatment-related cognitive decline."

Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) has been defined as a neurodevelopmental disorder with associated deficits in executive function, language, emotional, and social function. ASD has been associated with pathophysiology in cerebral organization. The current study investigated quantitative EEG findings in twenty children diagnosed with autistic disorders as compared to 20 controls matched for gender, age and IQ.
Methods
The EEG was recorded during an eyes-closed resting condition and topographical differences in cerebral functioning were examined using estimates of absolute, relative, and total power, as well as intrahemispheric and interhemispheric coherences.
Results
There were group differences in power, intrahemispheric and interhemispheric coherences. Findings included excessive theta, primarily in right posterior regions, in autistics. There was also a pattern of deficient delta over the frontal cortex and excessive midline beta. More significantly, there was a pattern of underconnectivity in autistics compared to controls. This included decreased intrahemispheric delta and theta coherences across short to medium and long inter-electrode distances. Interhemispherically, delta and theta coherences were low across the frontal region. Delta, theta and alpha hypocoherence was also evident over the temporal regions. Lastly, there were low delta, theta and beta coherence measurements across posterior regions.
Conclusions
These results suggest dysfunctional integration of frontal and posterior brain regions in autistics along with a pattern of neural underconnectivity. This is consistent with other EEG, MRI and fMRI research suggesting that neural connectivity anomalies are a major deficit leading to autistic symptomatology.
Significance
This paper reports the largest integrated study of EEG power and coherence during a resting state in children suffering autism spectrum disorder."

Here we performed event-related fMRI during visual processing of sexual core stimuli to pinpoint a neuronal correlate of sexual preference in humans. To dissociate gender of the stimulus from sexual preference, we studied male and female heterosexual and homosexual volunteers while they viewed sexual and nonsexual control stimuli. In contrast to previous work, we used core single-sex stimuli displaying male and female sexually aroused genitals. Since stimuli lacked any additional contextual information, they evoked no activity related to neuronal processing of faces, gestures or social interactions. Our prediction was that the sexual preference of the observer determines the neuronal responsiveness to pure male or female sexual stimuli in the human reward and motor system. Consistent with our prediction, the ventral striatum and the centromedian thalamus, showed a stronger neuronal response to preferred relative to non-preferred stimuli. Likewise, the ventral premotor cortex which is a key structure for imitative (mirror neurons) and tool-related (canonical neurons) actions showed a bilateral sexual preference-specific activation, suggesting that viewing sexually aroused genitals of the preferred sex triggers action representations of sexual behavior. The neuronal response of the ventral striatum, centromedian thalamus and ventral premotor cortex to preferred sexual stimuli was consistent across all groups. We propose that this invariant response pattern in core regions of the human reward and motor system represents a functional endophenotype for sexual orientation independent of the gender of the observer and gender of the stimulus."

Adolescent offspring of patients are developmentally vulnerable to impairments in several domains, including affective responding, yet the bases of these impairments and their relation to neuronal responses within the limbic system are poorly understood. The amygdala is the central region devoted to the processing of emotional valence and its sub-nuclei including the baso-lateral and centro-medial are organized in a relative hierarchy of affective processing. Outputs from the centro-medial nucleus converge on regions involved in the autonomous regulation of behavior, and outputs from the baso-lateral nucleus modulate the response of reward processing regions. Here using fMRI we assessed the intra-amygdala response to positive, negative, and neutral valenced faces in a group of controls (with no family history of psychosis) and offspring of schizophrenia parents (n=44 subjects in total). Subjects performed an affective continuous performance task during which they continually appraised whether the affect signaled by a face on a given trial was the same or different from the previous trial (regardless of facial identity). Relative to controls, offspring showed reduced activity in the left centro-medial nucleus to positively (but not negatively or neutral) valenced faces. These results were independent of behavioral/cognitive performance (equal across groups) suggesting that an impaired affective substrate in the intra-amygdala response may lie at the core of deficits of social behavior that have been documented in this population."

The sample included 15 medicated individuals with chronic schizophrenia (SZ) and 11 healthy control individuals (CON), matched for gender (all male), age, and years of education.
Results
A repeated measures 3 × 2 analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant interaction between expression intensity and group in right parahippocampal gyrus (p < .01). Individuals with chronic schizophrenia demonstrated a decrease, whereas CON showed an increase, in right parahippocampal gyrus response to increasingly fearful expressions. Between-group comparison revealed greater activation in SZ than CON in right parahippocampal gyrus to neutral faces. The reality distortion dimension, but not neuroleptic medication dose, was positively associated with the right parahippocampal gyral and right amygdalar response to neutral faces in SZ.
Conclusions
An abnormally increased parahippocampal response to neutral faces was positively associated with reality distortion in SZ. This may underlie the previously reported finding of a misattribution of emotional salience to nonsalient social stimuli in schizophrenia."

Recent advances in functional brain imaging offer unique opportunities to explore the neurofunctional basis of tools used to assess personality differences which have proven their clinical usefulness. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, the focus was on the amygdala activation and we investigated whether individual differences in activity of the amygdala following presentation of emotional expressions in the face and the whole body may be systematically related to the presence of Type D (distressed) personality or to its constituting factors, Negative Affectivity (NA) and Social Inhibition (SI). Our results show that the observed difference in amygdala activity between fearful and neutral expressions was present in participants that did not meet the criteria for Type D personality, while this effect was absent in participants that could be classified as Type D personality. Our correlation analyses further showed that the activation in the left amygdala elicited by fearful versus neutral bodily expressions correlated negatively with the Negative Affectivity score. The same pattern was observed for the right amygdala for fearful facial and bodily expressions when contrasted with neutral facial and bodily expressions.
Résumé
Les progrès récents en imagerie fonctionnelle cérébrale nous offrent un moyen privilégié d’étude des fondements neurofonctionnels d’outils utilisés pour évaluer les différences de personnalités et dont la valeur clinique est reconnue. Le but de cette étude en imagerie par résonance magnétique fonctionnelle (IRMf), qui portait sur l’amygdale, était de déterminer si les différences interindividuelles d’activité au sein de l’amygdale en réponse à l’observation d’expressions corporelles et faciales émotionnelles pouvait être expliquée par la présence d’une personnalité D (détresse) ou de l’un de ses facteurs constituants, mesurés par des scores d’affects négatifs ou d’inhibition sociale. Nos résultats montrent qu’une différence d’activité au sein de l’amygdale entre expressions de peur et expressions neutres est présente chez les individus qui ne répondent pas aux critères de personnalité D, cette différence disparaît chez les sujets répondant aux critères de personnalité D. Les analyses de corrélation montrent de plus que l’activation de l’amygdale gauche détectée dans la comparaison entre expressions corporelles de peur et expressions corporelles neutres est corrélée négativement avec les scores d’affects négatifs. Une corrélation négative entre les scores d’affects négatifs et l’activation de l’amygdale droite est également observée lorsque les expressions de peur sont contrastées aux expressions neutres, indépendamment du fait que ces expressions soient faciales ou corporelles."

abstract = "Reversal learning refers to the ability to inhibit or switch responding to an object when the object-reward contingency changes. Deficits in this process are related to social abnormalities, impulsiveness, and a number of psychiatric disorders. A range of neural regions play a role in this process, including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). However, determining the specific functional contribution of each region has proved difficult, in part because reversal learning involves multiple cognitive subprocesses such as error detection, inhibiting responding to formerly rewarded stimuli, and overcoming avoidance of previously punished stimuli. We used fMRI and an experimental task adapted from a recent neurochemical study in marmosets to parse neural responding to subprocesses of reversal learning during choice and feedback trial components. Error-feedback processing was associated with increased activity in dmPFC, dlPFC, and IFG whether participants were overcoming avoidance, inhibiting responding, or performing classic response reversal. Reduced activity in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was associated with error-feedback processing for response inhibition but not overcoming avoidance. Conversely, there was significantly greater activity in anterior dmPFC during error-feedback processing in overcoming avoidance compared to response inhibition. A conjunction analysis confirmed that a striking overlap in activity was observed across the three conditions in IFG, dlPFC, and dmPFC. The results are consistent with conceptualizations of IFG function that emphasize modulating stimulus–response maps rather than purely response inhibition. The approach has implications for models of prefrontal function and neurocognitive perspectives on a range of behavioural abnormalities associated with impairments in decision making."

It has been suggested that response conflict and cognitive control increase during deceptive acts but this hypothesis has not been evaluated directly. Using fMRI, we tested this prediction for the execution of an intentional false response. Subjects were instructed to respond truthfully or falsely to a series of yes/no questions that were also varied in autobiographical and nonautobiographical content to further examine the influence of personal relevance when lying. We observed an interference effect (longer reaction times for false versus true responses) that was accompanied by increased activation within the anterior cingulate, caudate and thalamic nuclei, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a circuit that has been implicated in response conflict and cognitive control. Behavioral and neural effects were more robust when falsifying autobiographical responses relative to nonautobiographical responses. Furthermore, a correlation between reaction time and left caudate activity supported the presence of increased response inhibition when falsifying responses. When presented with self-relevant (autobiographical) stimuli regardless of response condition, the mesial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices were recruited. Neural activity within these two regions and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) also showed correlations with self-report personality measures from the Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI). Overall, we conclude that the process of interference is inherent to the act of falsifying information and that the amount of conflict induced and cognitive control needed to successfully execute false responses is greater when dealing with personal information."

abstract = "Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have reported reduced activation in parietotemporal and occipitotemporal areas in adults and children with developmental dyslexia compared to controls during reading and reading related tasks. These patterns of regionally reduced activation have been linked to behavioral impairments of reading-related processes (e.g., phonological skills and rapid automatized naming). The observed functional and behavioral differences in individuals with developmental dyslexia have been complemented by reports of reduced gray matter in left parietotemporal, occipitotemporal areas, fusiform and lingual gyrus and the cerebellum. An important question for education is whether these neural differences are present before reading is taught. Developmental dyslexia can only be diagnosed after formal reading education starts. However, here we investigate whether the previously detected gray matter alterations in adults and children with developmental dyslexia can already be observed in a small group of pre-reading children with a family-history of developmental dyslexia compared to age and IQ-matched children without a family-history (N=20/mean age: 5:9years; age range 5:1–6:5years). Voxel-based morphometry revealed significantly reduced gray matter volume indices for pre-reading children with, compared to children without, a family-history of developmental dyslexia in left occipitotemporal, bilateral parietotemporal regions, left fusiform gyrus and right lingual gyrus. Gray matter volume indices in left hemispheric occipitotemporal and parietotemporal regions of interest also correlated positively with rapid automatized naming. No differences between the two groups were observed in frontal and cerebellar regions. This discovery in a small group of children suggests that previously described functional and structural alterations in developmental dyslexia may not be due to experience-dependent brain changes but may be present at birth or develop in early childhood prior to reading onset. Further studies using larger sample sizes and longitudinal analyses are needed in order to determine whether the identified structural alterations may be utilized as structural markers for the early identification of children at risk, which may prevent the negative clinical, social and psychological outcome of developmental dyslexia."
