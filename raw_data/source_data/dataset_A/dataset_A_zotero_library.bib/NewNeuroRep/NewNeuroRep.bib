	abstract = {The ability to identify the cause of another person’s emotional reaction is an important component associated with improved success of social relationships and survival. Although many studies have investigated the mechanisms involved in emotion recognition, very little is currently known regarding the processes involved during emotion attribution decisions. Research on complementary “emotion understanding” mechanisms, including empathy and theory of mind, has demonstrated that emotion understanding decisions are often made through relatively emotion- or cognitive-based processing streams. The current study was designed to investigate the behavioral and brain mechanisms involved in emotion attribution decisions. We predicted that dual processes, emotional and cognitive, are engaged during emotion attribution decisions. Sixteen healthy adults completed the Interpersonal Reactivity Index to characterize individual differences in tendency to make emotion- versus cognitive-based interpersonal decisions. Participants then underwent functional MRI while making emotion attribution decisions. We found neuroimaging evidence that emotion attribution decisions engage a similar brain network as other forms of emotion understanding. Further, we found evidence in support of a dual processes model involved during emotion attribution decisions. Higher scores of personal distress were associated with quicker emotion attribution decisions and increased anterior insula activity. Conversely, higher scores in perspective taking were associated with delayed emotion attribution decisions and increased prefrontal cortex and premotor activity. These findings indicate that the making of emotion attribution decisions relies on dissociable emotional and cognitive processing streams within the brain.},

Computer simulations with an attentional-associative model introduced by N. A. Schmajuk, Y. W. Lam, and J. A. Gray (1996) show that activity in the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex is well described by a variable representing the prediction of the unconditioned stimulus, whereas activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and insula is well captured by a variable coding the attentional-modulated representation of conditioned stimuli. In addition, the model explains how those variables control behavior and provides a clear framework in which those variables play important roles in the description of numerous classical conditioning paradigms. Also, the model offers a number of predictions related to stimulus novelty for future neuroimaging studies of associative learning.},

However, uncertainty remains regarding the effect of anxiety on responses to dynamic stimuli. We investigated this using dynamic fearful and neutral gaze as cues. Participants detected a peripheral target following the cue. Anxiety levels were measured after experiment (Experiment 1) or between anxiety manipulation and experiment (Experiment 2). We found a reaction time advantage for fearful vs. neutral gazes in both high and low state/trait anxiety participants. The results showed that dynamic fearful expressions facilitate gaze-triggered attention orienting, without moderation by high anxiety.},

	abstract = {Objective: Intranasal oxytocin has been shown to affect human social and emotional processing, but its potential to affect pain remains elusive. This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial investigated the effect of intranasal oxytocin on the perception and processing of noxious experimental heat in 36 healthy male volunteers.
Methods: Thermal thresholds were determined according to the Quantitative Sensory Testing protocol. A functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment including intensity and unpleasantness ratings of tonic heat was used to investigate the effects of oxytocin within the brain.
Results: Thirty men (aged 18–50 years) were included in the study. Intranasal oxytocin had no significant effect on thermal thresholds, but significantly (t = −2.06, p = .046) reduced heat intensity ratings during functional magnetic resonance imaging. The effect on intensity ratings was small (−3.46 points on a 100-point visual analog scale [95\% confidence interval \{CI\} = −6.86 to −0.07] and independent of temperature. No effects of oxytocin on stimulus- or temperature-related processing were found at the whole-brain level at a robust statistical threshold. A region of interest analysis indicated that oxytocin caused small but significant decreases in left (−0.045\%, 95\% CI = −0.087 to −0.003, t = −2.19, p = .037) and right (−0.051\%, 95\% CI = −0.088 to −0.014], t = −2.82, p = .008) amygdala activity across all temperatures.
Conclusions: The present study provides evidence for a significant but subtle inhibitory effect of oxytocin on thermal stimulus ratings and concurrent amygdala activity. Neither of the two effects significantly depended of temperature; therefore, the hypothesis of a pain-specific effect of oxytocin could not be confirmed.},

However, there are very few fMRI studies using dynamic emotional stimuli. The aim of this study was (1) to introduce and evaluate a new stimulus database of static and dynamic emotional facial expressions according to arousal and recognizability investigated by a rating by both participants of the present fMRI study and by an external sample of 30 healthy women, (2) to examine the neural networks involved in emotion perception of static and dynamic facial stimuli separately, and (3) to examine the impact of motion on the emotional processing of dynamic compared to static face stimuli. A total of 16 females participated in the present fMRI study performing a passive emotion perception task including static and dynamic faces of neutral, happy and disgusted expressions. Comparing dynamic stimuli to static faces indicated enhanced emotionspecific brain activation patterns in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) including the amygdala (AMG), fusiform gyrus (FG), superior temporal gyrus (STG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and occipital and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). These regions have been discussed to be associated with emotional memory encoding, the perception of threat, facial identity, biological motion, the mirror neuron system, an increase of emotional arousal, and reward processing, respectively. Post hoc ratings of the dynamic stimuli revealed a better recognizability in comparison to the static stimuli. In conclusion, dynamic facial expressions might provide a more appropriate approach to examine the processing of emotional face perception than static stimuli.},

	abstract = {Facial emotion perception plays a fundamental role in interpersonal social interactions. Images of faces contain visual information at various spatial frequencies. The amygdala has previously been reported to be preferentially responsive to low-spatial frequency (LSF) rather than to high-spatial frequency (HSF) filtered images of faces presented at the center of the visual field. Furthermore, it has been proposed that the amygdala might be especially sensitive to affective stimuli in the periphery. In the present study we investigated the impact of spatial frequency and stimulus eccentricity on face processing in the human amygdala and fusiform gyrus using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The spatial frequencies of pictures of fearful faces were filtered to produce images that retained only LSF or HSF information. Facial images were presented either in the left or right visual field at two different eccentricities. In contrast to previous findings, we found that the amygdala responds to LSF and HSF stimuli in a similar manner regardless of the location of the affective stimuli in the visual field. Furthermore, the fusiform gyrus did not show differential responses to spatial frequency filtered images of faces. Our findings argue against the view that LSF information plays a crucial role in the processing of facial expressions in the amygdala and of a higher sensitivity to affective stimuli in the periphery. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is still unclear whether the neural mechanisms underlying the moral judgment of pro-social lying differ from those underlying the moral judgment of anti-social lying. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the neural activities associated with moral judgment in anti- and pro-social lying. During fMRI scanning, subjects were provided with scenarios describing a protagonist's anti- and pro-social lying and were then asked to judge whether the protagonist's act was morally appropriate. The behavioral data showed that anti-social lying was mostly judged to be morally inappropriate and that prosocial lying was mainly judged to be morally appropriate. The functional imaging data revealed dissociable neural systems for moral judgment in anti- and pro-social lying. The anti-social lying, which was judged to be morally inappropriate, was associated with increased activity in the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex, right middle frontal gyrus, right precuneus/posterior cingulate gyrus, left posterior cingulate gyrus, and bilateral temporoparietal junction when compared with the control condition. The pro-social lying, which was judged to be morally appropriate, was associated with increased activity in the right middle temporal gyrus, right supramarginal gyrus, and the left middle cingulate gyrus when compared with the control condition. No overlapping activity was observed during the moral judgment of anti- and pro-social lying. Our data suggest that cognitive and neural processes for the moral judgment of lying are modulated by whether the lie serves to harm or beneﬁt listeners.},

Yet, most of those studies have taken single lexical items (i.e., words outside a context) as the investigative tool. In the present study, we examined the neural substrates of in-context language control in unbalanced bilinguals with a sentence-end switching paradigm. Our results showed that in-context language control in bilinguals recruited the neural mechanisms that were similar in kind to those responsible for cognitive control in general. When the direction of switching was considered, we found that backward switching called for more cognitive/ language control relative to forward switching. Behaviorally, symmetric switching costs were found regardless of the switching factor (switching vs. non-switching) and the language factor (L1 vs. L2). We interpreted our imaging and behavioral results as the effects of context when unbalanced bilinguals controlled their two languages in a context.},

Previous research has demonstrated uni-modal contrastive aftereffects for emotionally expressive faces or voices. Here we were interested in whether these aftereffects transfer across modality as theoretical models predict. We show that adaptation to facial expressions elicits signiﬁcant auditory aftereffects. Adaptation to angry facial expressions caused ambiguous vocal stimuli drawn from an anger-fear morphed continuum to be perceived as less angry and more fearful relative to adaptation to fearful faces. In a second experiment, we demonstrate that these aftereffects are not dependent on learned face-voice congruence, i.e. adaptation to one facial identity transferred to an unmatched voice identity. Taken together, our ﬁndings provide support for a supra-modal representation of emotion and suggest further that identity and emotion may be processed independently from one another, at least at the supra-modal level of the processing hierarchy.},

	abstract = {To comprehend ﬁgurative utterances such as metaphor or sarcasm, a listener must both judge the literal meaning of the statement and infer the speaker’s intended meaning (mentalizing; Amodio and Frith, 2006). To delineate the neural substrates of pragmatic comprehension, we conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with 20 normal adult volunteers. Participants read short stories followed by a target sentence. Depending on the context provided by the preceding stories, the target sentences were classiﬁed as follows: (1) metaphor versus literally coherent; (2) metaphor versus literally incoherent; (3) sarcasm versus literally coherent; and (4) sarcasm versus literally incoherent. For each task pair, we directly compared the activations evoked by the same target sentences in the different contexts. The contrast images were incorporated into a 2 (metaphor and sarcasm) Â 2 (literal coherency and incoherency) design. Metaphor-speciﬁc activation was found in the head of the caudate, which might be involved in associating statements with potential meanings, and restricting sentence meanings within a set of possible candidates for what the speaker intended. Sarcasm-speciﬁc activation was found in the left amygdala, which is an important component of the neural substrates of social behavior. Conjunction analysis revealed that both metaphor and sarcasm activated the anterior rostral medial frontal cortex (arMFC), which is a key node of mentalizing. A distinct literal coherency effect was found in the orbital MFC, which is thought to be involved in monitoring. These mesial frontal areas are jointly involved in monitoring literal coherency and mentalizing within social contexts in order to comprehend the pragmatic meanings of utterances.},

A popular hypothesis is that procrastination is representative of self-regulatory failure. Although there is extensive behavioral evidence consistent with the predictions of this theory, there is no neural evidence for it. To test directly the extent to which individual differences in trait procrastination can be related to resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between brain regions implicated in self-regulation, we applied resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) in a group of 77 healthy participants. RSFC 1) between ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), 2) between dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and caudate, and 3) within ventral lateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), negatively predicted the severity of procrastination. These results provide direct evidence for the validity of self-regulatory failure account of procrastination, and implicate that trait procrastination is reﬂected in the intrinsic functional dynamics of neural systems associated with impulse control, performance monitoring, and behavioral inhibition.},

Processing of unpleasant words was associated with increased amygdala and also insula activation across all conditions. Pleasant stimuli were speciﬁcally associated with increased activation of amygdala and insula when related to the self (vs. other and no reference). Activity in the MPFC (vMPFC in particular) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was preferentially increased during processing of self-related emotional words (vs. other and no reference). These results demonstrate that amygdala activation in response to emotional stimuli is modulated by stimulus reference and that brain structures implicated in emotional and self-related processing might be important for the subjective experience of one’s own emotions.},

Previous studies have indeed showed that the boundaries of PPS are not ﬁxed but modulate according to properties of stimuli in the surrounding environment. In Experiment 1, participants performed a simple tactile detection task of targets presented to their right hand. Concurrently, they were presented with intensity-changing task-irrelevant artiﬁcial sound sources perceived as approaching toward their body. The physical properties of the sound elicited emotional responses of either neutral or negative valence. Results showed larger PPS when the approaching stimulus had negative as compared to neutral emotional valence. In Experiment 2, we used ecological sounds which content (i.e., psychological associations to the sound producing source), rather than physical properties, elicited emotional responses of negative, positive or neutral valence. In agreement with results from experiment 1, we found larger PPS when the approaching stimuli had negative emotional valence as compared to both neutral and positive ones. Results are discussed within the theoretical framework that conceives PPS as a safety zone around one’s body.},

	abstract = {The reward surfeit model of overeating suggests that heightened brain response to rewards contributes to overeating and subsequent weight gain. However, previous studies have not tested whether brain response to reward is associated with food intake, particularly during childhood, a period of dynamic development in reward and inhibitory control neurocircuitry. We conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with 7–11year-old children (n = 59; healthy weight, n = 31; overweight, n = 28; 54\% female) while they played a modiﬁed card-guessing paradigm to examine blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response to anticipating and winning rewards (food, money, neutral). Food intake was assessed at three separate meals that measured diﬀerent facets of eating behavior: 1) typical consumption (baseline), 2) overindulgence (palatable buﬀet), and 3) eating in the absence of hunger (EAH). A priori regions of interest included regions implicated in both reward processing and inhibitory control. Multiple stepwise regressions were conducted to examine the relationship between intake and BOLD response to rewards. Corrected results showed that a greater BOLD response in the medial prefrontal cortex for anticipating food compared to money positively correlated with how much children ate at the baseline and palatable buﬀet meals. BOLD response in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for winning food compared to money was positively correlated with intake at the palatable buﬀet meal and EAH. All aforementioned relationships were independent of child weight status. Findings support the reward surfeit model by showing that increased brain response to food compared to money rewards positively correlates with laboratory measures of food intake in children.},

An interesting contrast is provided by Finnish and Swedish where most inﬂected Finnish nouns tend to show a processing cost (i.e., longer reaction times and higher error rates) compared to monomorphemic nouns, while most inﬂected Swedish nouns do not show such a cost. This has been taken as evidence for morphological decomposition in Finnish and full-form recognition of inﬂected nouns in Swedish. While most previous imaging studies had studied the two morphological processing routes (decomposition and storage) within the same language and often by comparing regular vs. irregular forms, we employed a crosslanguage setting and a direct contrast between morphologically complex vs. simple words. We subjected high-proﬁcient Finnish–Swedish early bilinguals to a visual lexical decision task with inﬂected vs. monomorphemic Finnish and Swedish nouns while measuring their brain activation by fMRI. The participants showed an inﬂectional processing cost and related left fronto-temporal activation increases in Finnish but not in Swedish. This suggests a language-speciﬁc processing difference in the brain, possibly reﬂecting the structural difference between these two languages.},

Furthermore, the current study employed a meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) to map the meta-analytic coactivation maps of regions of interest (ROIs). Our ALE analysis revealed signiﬁcant convergent activations in some vital brain areas involved in emotional prediction, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). For the MACM analysis, we identiﬁed that the DLPFC, VLPFC and OFC were the core areas in the coactivation network of emotional prediction. Overall, the results of ALE and MACM indicated that prefrontal brain areas play critical roles in emotional prediction.},

However, the expectations we generate on the basis of people's emotions can mismatch their actual behaviour in certain circumstances, which generates conﬂict. In the present study, we explored the neural mechanisms of emotional conﬂict during interpersonal interactions. Participants had to accept or reject economic offers made by several partners who displayed emotional expressions. On every trial, a cue informed participants of whether they could trust the emotion of their partner or not. Trustworthy (low-conﬂict) partners with happy facial expressions were cooperative and those with angry expressions did not cooperate. Untrustworthy (highconﬂict) partners, on the other hand, cooperated when their expression was angry and did not cooperate when they displayed a happy emotion. Behavioural responses were faster for trustworthy than for untrustworty partners. High-conﬂict partners activated the anterior cingulate and the anterior insula. In turn, trustworthy partners were associated with activations in the left precuneus. Our results suggest that the emotion displayed by another person affects our decision-making in social contexts. When emotional expressions are linked to their natural consequences, they engage ToM processes. In contrast, untrustworthy emotional expressions engage conﬂict-related brain regions.},

In this fMRI study, participants viewed reaching behaviors in which one of four animated characters moved a hand towards one of two objects and either (a) picked up the object, (b) missed the object, or (c) changed his path halfway to lift the other object. The characters included a human, a humanoid robot, stacked boxes with an arm, and a mechanical claw. The ﬁrst three moved in an identical, human-like biological pattern. Right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) activity increased when the human or humanoid robot shifted goals or missed the target relative to obtaining the original goal. This suggests that the pSTS was engaged differentially for ﬁgures that appeared more human-like rather than for all human-like motion. Medial frontal areas that are part of a protagonist-monitoring network with the right pSTS (e.g., Mason and Just, 2006) were most engaged for the human character, followed by the robot character. The current data suggest that goal-directed action and intention understanding require this network and it is used similarly for the two processes. Moreover, it is modulated by character identity rather than only the presence of biological motion. We discuss the implications for behavioral theories of goal-directed action and intention understanding.},

While for verbal stimuli the increasing strength of subjective evaluation was correlated with increased neural activation of precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex (PC/PCC), a similar effect was observed for nonverbal stimuli in the amygdala. These ﬁndings support the assumption that qualitatively different cognitive operations underlie person evaluation depending upon the stimulus domain: while the processing of nonverbal person information may be more strongly associated with affective processing as indexed by recruitment of the amygdala, verbal person information engaged the PC/PCC that has been related to social inferential processing.},

	abstract = {People suppressing their emotions while facing an emotional event typically remember it less well. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the impairing effect of emotion suppression on successful memory encoding are not well understood. Because successful memory encoding relies on the hippocampus and the amygdala, we hypothesized that memory impairments due to emotion suppression are associated with down-regulated activity in these brain areas. 59 healthy females were instructed either to simply watch the pictures or to down-regulate their emotions by using a response-focused emotion suppression strategy. Brain activity was recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and free recall of pictures was tested afterwards. As expected, suppressing one's emotions resulted in impaired recall of the pictures. On the neural level, the memory impairments were associated with reduced activity in the right hippocampus during successful encoding. No signiﬁcant effects were observed in the amygdala. In addition, functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was strongly reduced during emotion suppression, and these reductions predicted free-recall performance. Our results indicate that emotion suppression interferes with memory encoding on the hippocampal level, possibly by decoupling hippocampal and prefrontal encoding processes, suggesting that response-focused emotion suppression might be an adaptive strategy for impairing hippocampal memory formation in highly arousing situations.},

With searchlight representational similarity analysis, we investigate where category membership drives similarity in neural patterns during moral judgment of violations from two key moral domains: Harm and Purity. Representations converge across domains in a network of regions resembling the mentalizing network. However, Harm and Purity violation representations respectively converge in different regions: precuneus (PC) and left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG). Examining substructure within moral domains, Harm violations converge in PC regardless of subdomain (physical harms, psychological harms), while Purity subdomains (pathogen-related violations, sex-related violations) converge in distinct sets of regions –mirroring a dissociation observed in principal-component analysis of behavioral data. Further, we ﬁnd initial evidence for representation of morally relevant features within these two domain-encoding regions. The present analyses offer a case study for understanding how organization within the complex conceptual space of moral violations is reﬂected in the organization of neural patterns across the cortex.},

Here we investigated the correlation between resting-state functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) measures [degree centrality (DC)/fractional amplitude of low frequency ﬂuctuations (fALFFs)] and Stroop interference. We examined this relationship in the brains of 958 healthy young adults. DC reﬂects the number of instantaneous functional connections between a region and the rest of the brain within the entire connectivity matrix of the brain (connectome), and thus how much of the node inﬂuences the entire brain areas, while fALFF is an indicator of the intensity of regional brain spontaneous activity. Reduced Stroop interference was associated with larger DC in the left lateral prefrontal cortex, left IFJ, and left inferior parietal lobule as well as larger fALFF in the areas of the dorsal attention network and the precuneus. These ﬁndings suggest that Stroop performance is reﬂected in resting state functional properties of these areas and the network. In addition, default brain activity of the dorsal attention network and precuneus as well as higher cognitive processes represented there, and default stronger global inﬂuence of the areas critical in executive functioning underlie better Stroop performance.},

To perform these experiments is still a challenge. New method: To address the challenge posed by MR settings, an olfactometer design is presented including speciﬁc improvements to the limited number of already existing olfactometers. Innovative features such as pneumatically controlled pinch valves, useable in the scanner and providing exact stimulus timing as well as a 3D-printed nasal mask inlet for common sleep laboratory masks that can be used for lateral divided stimulus presentation are introduced. To ensure a fully automated and mobile system, the use of a ﬂexible and easily-adapted Matlab-Code and a portable adaptable container system are presented.
Results: The functional efﬁciency of these features are proven by results of an fMRI study as well as testing temporal resolution and concentration stability with a mass spectrometer.
Comparison with existing methods: The 24-channel olfactometer design presented here provides an inexpensive alternative to the currently available olfactometers including the achievement of fast onset times, lateral divided stimulus presentation and high ﬂexibility and adaptability to different scientiﬁc questions.
Conclusion: The olfactometer design presented in this paper can be seen as a realistic and feasible solution to overcome the challenges of presenting olfactory stimuli within the MR setting.},

By means of fMRI, this question was investigated in the item-method directed forgetting paradigm. Behavioral results demonstrated that although all kinds of material could be forgotten, negative words showed reduced directed forgetting effect. At the neural level, the initial viewing of negative words elicited increased activities in inferior frontal gyrus and superior parietal lobule when contrasted with neutral words, which reﬂected the capture of attention by negative content. Forgetting instructions for negative and neutral words led to enhanced activations in frontal and parietal cortex, consistent with the engagement of an active inhibitory process. Surprisingly, whereas successful directed forgetting of neutral words elicited stronger activations in right middle frontal gyrus compared with incidental forgetting, no such activation was observed for negative words. The lack of activation for negative words may be due to an attentional bias in processing negative words, which may briefly interfere with the deployment of inhibitory control. The present ﬁndings are consistent with the engagement of an active forgetting mechanism that contributes to the item-method directed forgetting. However, evidence of impeded inhibitory control suggests that forgetting negative words is harder.},

We found that at both time points, the trait anxiety score was signiﬁcantly associated with intrinsic brain activity (both the ALFF and ReHo) in the right ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and ALFF of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/anterior midcingulate cortex (dACC/aMCC). More importantly, the change in intrinsic brain activity in the right insula was predictive of intra-individual state anxiety variability over a 9-month interval. The test–retest nature of this study's design could provide an opportunity to distinguish between the intrinsic brain activity associated with state and trait anxiety.

The results revealed that the fALFF in the bilateral posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG), right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), right thalamus and right insula positively predicted individual differences in social well-being. Furthermore, we demonstrated the different role of three pursuits of human well-being (i.e., pleasure, meaning and engagement) in these associations. Speciﬁcally, the pursuits of meaning and engagement, not pleasure mediated the effect of the fALFF in right pSTG on social well-being, whereas the pursuit of engagement mediated the effect of the fALFF in right thalamus on social wellbeing. Taken together, we provide the ﬁrst evidence that spontaneous brain activity in multiple regions related to self-regulatory and social-cognitive processes contributes to social well-being, suggesting that the spontaneous activity of the human brain reﬂects the efﬁciency of social well-being.},

In this fMRI study, we compared reading person and object descriptions denoted by nouns or adjectives. Previous behavioral studies found that nouns, describing the more abstract construct of social categories, compared to adjectives, describing the more concrete construct of personality traits, have an impact on the inferences made about a person. Additionally, previous neuroimaging ﬁndings suggest that abstract constructs recruit a different pattern of brain activation, compared to more concrete constructs. Participants read sentences describing a protagonist by means of a noun or an adjective, as well as sentences describing objects through a noun or an adjective. The results revealed that reading nouns as opposed to adjectives showed increased activation in the left lingual gyrus for persons, and additionally in the right lingual gyrus for objects. The results indicate that there are limited differences in the processing of nouns and adjectives when describing persons.},

However, the neural mechanisms underlying androstadienone’s impact on the perception of emotional stimuli have not been clariﬁed. To characterize how the compound modiﬁes neural circuitry while attending to emotional information, 22 subjects (11 women) underwent two fMRI scanning sessions, one with an androstadienone solution and one with a carrier control solution alone on their upper lip. During each session, participants viewed blocks of emotionally positive, negative, or neutral images. The BOLD response to emotional images (relative to neutral images) was greater during exposure to androstadienone in right orbitofrontal and lateral prefrontal cortex, particularly during positive image blocks. Androstadienone did not impact the response to social images, compared to nonsocial images, and results were not related to participant sex or olfactory sensitivity. To examine how androstadienone inﬂuences effective connectivity of this network, a dynamic causal model was employed with primary visual cortex (V1), amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex on each side. These models indicated that emotional images increased the drive from V1 to the amygdala during the control session. With androstadienone present, this drive to amygdala was decreased speciﬁcally for positive images, which drove downstream increases in orbitofrontal and prefrontal activity. This evidence suggests that androstadienone may act as a chemical signal to increase attention to positively valenced information via modiﬁcations to amygdala connectivity.},

For our evidence, we propose and estimate a dynamic model of tie formation using different experimental datasets regarding public goods, test its within-sample and out-of-sample predictive performance, and compare it with other models. In addition to the support obtained for the mechanism, we ﬁnd that the effects of interaction experiences show substantial persistence over time, and that only a minority looks ahead to strategically inﬂuence the behavior of interaction partners. Furthermore, our model appears to track the often volatile behavioral dynamics of the different datasets remarkably well. Additional evidence is presented of a neural substrate of the tie mechanism, based on a recent (fMRI) application of the estimated model, and of the explanatory power of our model regarding other extant experimental ﬁndings.

This eﬀect may depend on variability in stress reactivity and past subjective stress. However, as most studies employed between-subjects designs, evidence for within-subject stress eﬀects remains scarce. To understand the role of intra-individual stress eﬀects on WM, we adopted a within-subject design to study how acute stress, variability in stress reactivity, and past subjective stress inﬂuence behavioral and neural WM mechanisms. Thirty-four healthy males performed a WM task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a control versus acute stress condition following the Trier Social Stress Test, a validated psychosocial stressor method. We tested for stress eﬀects on WM performance and related neural activation by associating them with individual acute stress responsivity and past subjective stress experience using retrospective self-report questionnaires. We found no evidence of an eﬀect of acute stress or related stress-reactivity on intra-individual WM performance. However, past subjective stress negatively inﬂuenced acute stress-induced changes to WM. On the neural level, acute stress reduced WM-related activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). The observed negative inﬂuence of inter-individual variability in past subjective stress experience on changes in WM performance, suggests that past subjective stress might induce vulnerability for impairing eﬀects of acute stress on cognitive functioning. Because acute stress reduced WM-related dlPFC activation while WM performance remained unaﬀected, acute stress might boost neural processing eﬃciency in this group of high performing healthy individuals. Our study suggests that measures of past subjective stress should be considered when studying and interpreting the eﬀects of acute stress on cognition.},

	abstract = {Complex cognitive processes, including language, rely on multiple mental operations that are carried out by several large-scale functional networks in the frontal, temporal, and parietal association cortices of the human brain. The central division of cognitive labor is between two fronto-parietal bilateral networks: (a) the multiple demand (MD) network, which supports executive processes, such as working memory and cognitive control, and is engaged by diverse task domains, including language, especially when comprehension gets diﬃcult; and (b) the default mode network (DMN), which supports introspective processes, such as mind wandering, and is active when we are not engaged in processing external stimuli. These two networks are strongly dissociated in both their functional proﬁles and their patterns of activity ﬂuctuations during naturalistic cognition. Here, we focus on the functional relationship between these two networks and a third network: (c) the fronto-temporal leftlateralized “core” language network, which is selectively recruited by linguistic processing. Is the language network distinct and dissociated from both the MD network and the DMN, or is it synchronized and integrated with one or both of them? Recent work has provided evidence for a dissociation between the language network and the MD network. However, the relationship between the language network and the DMN is less clear, with some evidence for coordinated activity patterns and similar response proﬁles, perhaps due to the role of both in semantic processing. Here we use a novel fMRI approach to examine the relationship among the three networks: we measure the strength of activations in diﬀerent language, MD, and DMN regions to functional contrasts typically used to identify each network, and then test which regions co-vary in their contrast eﬀect sizes across 60 individuals. We ﬁnd that eﬀect sizes correlate strongly within each network (e.g., one language region and another language region, or one DMN region and another DMN region), but show little or no correlation for region pairs across networks (e.g., a language region and a DMN region). Thus, using our novel method, we replicate the language/MD network dissociation discovered previously with other approaches, and also show that the language network is robustly dissociated from the DMN, overall suggesting that these three networks contribute to high-level cognition in diﬀerent ways and, perhaps, support distinct computations. Inter-individual diﬀerences in eﬀect sizes therefore do not simply reﬂect general diﬀerences in vascularization or attention, but exhibit sensitivity to the functional architecture of the brain. The strength of activation in each network can thus be probed separately in studies that attempt to link neural variability to behavioral or genetic variability.},

However, results on the impact of normal range testosterone levels on explicit emotion recognition as a prerequisite for social interaction and amygdala activation in healthy young males are missing. Hence, we performed functional MRI at 3 T in a group of 21 healthy males during explicit emotion recognition with a protocol speciﬁcally optimized to reliably detect amygdala activation. We observed similar amygdala activation to all emotions presented without any effect of gender of poser or laterality. Reaction times to fearful male faces were found negatively correlated to testosterone concentration, while no signiﬁcant effects emerged for other emotions and neutral expressions. Correlation analyses revealed a signiﬁcant positive association between testosterone levels and amygdala response to fearful and angry facial expressions, but not to other expressions. Hence, our results demonstrate that testosterone levels affect amygdala activation and also behavioral responses particularly to threat-related emotions in healthy young males. We conclude that these ﬁndings add to our understanding of emotion processing and its modulation by neuroendocrine factors.},

It has been argued that the mirror neuron system may be the key neural locus of such coordination. Instead, here we show that such coordination recruits two separable sets of areas: one that could translate between motor and visual codes and one that could integrate these information to achieve common goals. The former includes regions of the putative mirror neuron system, the latter, regions of the prefrontal, posterior parietal and temporal lobe adjacent to the putative mirror neuron system. Both networks were more active while participants cooperated with a human agent, responding to their actions, compared to a computer that did not, evidencing their social dimension. This ﬁnding shows that although the putative mirror neuron system can play a critical role in joint actions by translating both agents' actions into a common code, the ﬂexible remapping of our own actions with those of others required during joint actions seems to be performed outside of the putative mirror neuron system.},

Older and young adults were presented with images of stigmatized individuals (e.g., individuals with amputations, substance abusers) and of normal controls while they underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging. All participants were also given a battery of tests to assess their executive function capacity. Young adults showed more activity in areas associated with empathy (i.e., medial prefrontal cortex) than did older adults when viewing stigmatized faces. By contrast, older adults with relatively preserved levels of executive function had heightened activity in areas previously implicated in emotion regulation (i.e., lateral prefrontal cortex) as compared to other groups. These results suggest that although cognitive decline may interfere with older adults’ attitudes toward stigmatized individuals, older adults with relatively preserved cognitive function may utilize different strategies to compensate for these deficits.},

Going beyond previous work, we show for the ﬁrst time that activity in a central location map in the model, which computes the saliency of a target relative to distractors, correlated with the BOLD response in the right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) – a key region implicated in clinical studies of unilateral neglect. This is consistent with the right TPJ responding to the relative saliency of visual stimuli. In addition, a re-analysis of search performance, with a larger participant set and a psychologically plausible response rule, showed distinct neural regions in parietal and occipital cortices linked to top-down excitation and the to active ignoring of distractors. The results indicate that excitatory and inhibitory circuits for visual selection can be separated, and that the right TPJ may be critical for responding to salient targets. The value of using a model-based approach is discussed.},

	abstract = {Understanding others’ emotions requires both the identiﬁcation of overt behaviors (“smiling”) and the attribution of behaviors to a cause (“friendly disposition”). Previous research suggests that whereas emotion identiﬁcation depends on a cortical mirror system that enables the embodiment of observed motor behavior within one's own motor system, causal attribution for emotion depends on a separate cortical mentalizing system, so-named because its function is associated with mental state representation. We used fMRI to test an Identiﬁcation–Attribution model of mirror and mentalizing system contributions to the comprehension of emotional behavior. Normal volunteers watched a set of ecologically valid videos of human emotional displays. During each viewing, volunteers either identiﬁed an emotion-relevant motor behavior (explicit identiﬁcation) or inferred a plausible social cause (explicit attribution). These explicit identiﬁcation and attribution goals strongly distinguished activity in the mirror and mentalizing systems, respectively. However, frontal mirror areas, though preferentially engaged by the identiﬁcation goal, nevertheless exhibited activation when observers possessed the attribution goal. One of these areas—right posterior inferior frontal gyrus—demonstrated effective connectivity with areas of the mentalizing system during attributional processing. These results support an integrative model of the neural systems supporting the comprehension of emotional behavior, where the mirror system helps facilitate the rapid identiﬁcation of emotional expressions that then serve as inputs to attributional processing in the mentalizing system.},

	abstract = {Caffeine has become the most prevalently consumed psychostimulant in the world, but its influences on daily real-world functioning are relatively unknown. The present work investigated the effects of caffeine (0 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg) on a commonplace language task that required readers to identify and correct 4 error types in extended discourse: simple local errors (misspelling 1- to 2-syllable words), complex local errors (misspelling 3- to 5-syllable words), simple global errors (incorrect homophones), and complex global errors (incorrect subject-verb agreement and verb tense). In 2 placebo-controlled, double-blind studies using repeated-measures designs, we found higher detection and repair rates for complex global errors, asymptoting at 200 mg in low consumers (Experiment 1) and peaking at 400 mg in high consumers (Experiment 2). In both cases, covariate analyses demonstrated that arousal state mediated the relationship between caffeine consumption and the detection and repair of complex global errors. Detection and repair rates for the other 3 error types were not affected by caffeine consumption. Taken together, we demonstrate that caffeine has differential effects on error detection and repair as a function of dose and error type, and this relationship is closely tied to caffeine’s effects on subjective arousal state. These results support the notion that central nervous system stimulants may enhance global processing of language-based materials and suggest that such effects may originate in caffeine-related right hemisphere brain processes. Implications for understanding the relationships between caffeine consumption and real-world cognitive functioning are discussed.},

We expected to ﬁnd evidence for an antagonistic modulation of cognition by threat-relevant and threat-irrelevant negative affect (i.e. fear and sadness) that should promote bottom-up monitoring and top-down selection, respectively. Subjects performed one of three conﬂict tasks (Stroop, Flanker, or Simon) that tap distinct control mechanisms of conﬂict resolution, comprising speciﬁc attentional and motor control processes. On each task trial, target stimuli were preceded by a face stimulus exhibiting a fearful, sad, or neutral expression, providing three affect conditions. Our data provides strong evidence for substantially increased selection (attentional and motor selection) after priming of threat-irrelevant negative affect (sadness). Deviating from the results of previous studies, our analysis did not consistently yield increased monitoring after fear priming. We discuss these ﬁndings with respect to the effectiveness of different experimental affect priming procedures (i.e. stimuli) and the role of the task context, among others.},

	abstract = {Areas involved in social cognition, such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the left temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) appear to be active during the classiﬁcation of sentences according to emotional criteria (happy, angry or sad, [Beaucousin et al., 2007]). These two regions are frequently co-activated in studies about theory of mind (ToM). To conﬁrm that these regions constitute a coherent network during affective speech comprehension, new event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired, using the emotional and grammatical-person sentence classiﬁcation tasks on a larger sample of 51 participants. The comparison of the emotional and grammatical tasks conﬁrmed the previous ﬁndings. Functional connectivity analyses established a clear demarcation between a “Medial” network, including the mPFC and TPJ regions, and a bilateral “Language” network, which gathered inferior frontal and temporal areas. These ﬁndings suggest that emotional speech comprehension results from interactions between language, ToM and emotion processing networks. The language network, active during both tasks, would be involved in the extraction of lexical and prosodic emotional cues, while the medial network, active only during the emotional task, would drive the making of inferences about the sentences' emotional content, based on their meanings. The left and right amygdalae displayed a stronger response during the emotional condition, but were seldom correlated with the other regions, and thus formed a third entity. Finally, distinct regions belonging to the Language and Medial networks were found in the left angular gyrus, where these two systems could interface.},

	abstract = {There is ample evidence of gender differences in neural processes and behavior. Differences in reward-related behaviors have been linked to either temporary or permanent organizational inﬂuences of gonadal hormones on the mesolimbic dopamine system and reward-related activation. Still, little is known about the association between biological gender and the neural underpinnings of the ability to resist reward-related impulses. Here we assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging which neural processes enable men and women to successfully control their desire for immediate reward when this is required by a higher-order goal (i.e., during a ‘desire-reason dilemma’; Diekhof and Gruber, 2010). Thirty-two participants (16 females) were closely matched for age, personality characteristics (e.g., novelty seeking) and behavioral performance in the ‘desire-reason task’. On the neural level, men and women showed similarities in the general response of the nucleus accumbens and of the ventral tegmental area to predictors of immediate reward, but they differed in additional brain mechanisms that enabled self-controlled decisions against the preference for immediate reward. Firstly, men exhibited a stronger reduction of activation in the ventral pallidum, putamen, temporal pole and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex during the ‘desire-reason dilemma’. Secondly, connectivity analyses revealed a signiﬁcant change in the direction of the connectivity between anteroventral prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens during decisions counteracting the reward-related impulse when comparing men and women. Together, these ﬁndings support the view of a sexual dimorphism that manifested in the recruitment of genderspeciﬁc neural resources during the successful deployment of self-control.},

Behavioral studies have shown that children take more than a decade of exposure and training to become proﬁcient at processing faces at the individual level. The neurodevelopmental trajectories for different aspects of face-processing are still poorly understood. In this study, we used an fMR-adaptation design to investigate differential processing of three face aspects (identity, expression and gaze) in children, adolescents and adults. We found that, while all three tasks showed some overlap in activation patterns, there was a signiﬁcant age effect in the occipital and temporal lobes and the inferior frontal gyrus. More importantly, the degree of adaptation differed across the three age groups in the inferior occipital gyrus, a core face processing area that has been shown in previous studies to be both integral and necessary for individual-level face processing. In the younger children, adaptation in this region seemed to suggest the use of a predominantly featural processing strategy, whereas adaptation effects in the adults exhibited a more strategic pattern that depended on the task. Interestingly, our sample of adolescents did not exhibit any differential adaptation effects; possibly reﬂecting increased heterogeneity in processing strategies in this age group. Our results support the notion that, in line with improving behavioral face-processing abilities, core face-responsive regions develop throughout the ﬁrst two decades of life.},

	abstract = {Successful social interaction requires recognising the intention of another person's communicative gestures. At a neural level, this process may involve neural activity in different systems, such as the mentalizing system (MS) and the mirror neuron system (MNS). The aim of the present study was to explore the neural correlates of communicative gestures during observation and execution of these gestures. Twenty participants watched video clips of an actor executing social gestures (S), non-social gestures (NS) and meaningless gestures (ML). During fMRI data acquisition, participants were asked to observe (O) and subsequently to execute (E) one of two tasks: imitate the gesture presented (IMI) or perform a motor control task (CT). For the contrast IMI {\textgreater} CT we found activations in the core areas of the MNS [inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and inferior frontal cortex, the posterior part of pars opercularis], as well as in areas related to the MS [superior temporal sulcus (STS) and middle cingulate cortex]. For S {\textgreater} NS, we found activations in the left medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC), right superior frontal cortex and middle cingulate cortex. The interaction of stimulus condition (S vs NS) and task (IMI vs CT) revealed activation in the right IPL. For the interaction between observation vs execution (O vs E), task (IMI vs CT) and stimulus condition (S vs NS) we found activation in the right mOFC. Our data suggest that imitation is differentially processed in the MNS as well as in the MS. The activation in IPL is enhanced during the processing of social gestures most likely due to their communicative intention. The activation of IPL together with medial frontal areas may contribute to mentalizing processes. The interaction in the mOFC suggests an involvement of self-referential processes in the processing of social gesture.},

In the current study, normative data of such properties were obtained for a series of 875 French adjectives by asking 8 groups of 20 participants to each rate all words on one dimension of theoretical interest. The collected ratings indicate the extent to which each adjective evokes a sensory experience (concreteness), captures an enduring attribute (temporal stability), refers to a visible characteristic (visibility), denotes a neutral or an affectively laden concept (valence), signifies an attribute of low or high intensity, is familiar to the reader and can be used to describe people and/or inanimate entities such as objects. In addition, for each item its exact grammatical class (adjective vs. past participle adjective), length (i.e., number of letters, number of syllables), and word frequency was retrieved from the lexique3 corpus.

These sequential pathways are in line with the lexical semantic and non-semantic routes in the dual-route cascaded model.
