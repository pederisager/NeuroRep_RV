This directory contains the PDF files associated with the DOIs listed in pilot_sample_study_data.tsv. 


# Naming convention:
In order to ensure that PDF files have a unique and meaningful name, PDFs are named after the DOI they are linked too. 
However, because "/" cannot be part of a file name, all "/"s in the DOI is replaced by "-" in the name of the PDF.
