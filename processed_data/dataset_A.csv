The present study leveraged multivoxel pattern analysis of fMRI data to compare the neural encoding of familial and nonfamilial threatening and non-threatening stimuli in adolescents who endorsed varying levels of connectedness to their families. Adolescents (N = 22, Mage = 14.38 years) reporting lower family connectedness 1 year earlier showed elevated sensitivity to familial threat, but not to nonfamilial threat in a neural network associated with threat processing, comprising left and right amygdala, and right inferior and middle temporal gyri. Results suggest that a learning history about one's social environment may shape neural mechanisms of threat processing by sensitizing them to risk-relevant stimuli. Such findings advance our understanding of how familial stressors contribute to disordered threat processing in adolescence.","[Sharp, Paul B.; Telzer, Eva H.] Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Heller, Wendy] Univ Illinois, Dept Psychol, Champaign, IL USA","Sharp, PB (reprint author), Univ N Carolina, 106 Britt Court, Chapel Hill, NC 27514 USA.","psharp89@live.unc.edu","","D, CHAKRADHAR/0000-0001-8691-752X; Sharp, Paul/0000-0003-4949-1501","National Science Foundation [1459719]; National Institutes of Health [R01DA039923]; Department of Psychology at the University of Illinois; NIDA NIH HHS [R01 DA039923]","This paper was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation (#1459719 to EHT) and the National Institutes of Health (R01DA039923 to EHT), and generous funds from the Department of Psychology at the University of Illinois.

We analyzed participants' gaze aversion (an indicator of disengaging from the immediate environment) and cognitive construals (mentions of concrete characteristics vs abstract beliefs and values) during the interview, and relations to individuals' subsequent neural activations. When participants averted their gaze, they were more likely to mention abstract construals, and both behaviors were more likely when reacting to virtue. Gaze aversion to virtue narratives predicted greater subsequent activation for those narratives in dorsal posterior cingulate cortex (dPCC), involved in visual attention control. The inferior-posterior posteromedial cortices (ipPMC), a default mode network hub involved in abstract thought, activated only to virtue, and activity level reflected individuals' tendency to abstract construals. Critically, dPCC and ipPMC activity sequentially mediated the relationship between individuals' gaze and abstract construal tendencies. No such relationships existed for reactions to skill, despite participants reporting equivalently strong positive emotion. In appreciating virtue, dPCC may support individuals in transcending the viewable context, facilitating ipPMC activity and moral construals.","[Yang, Xiao-Fei; Immordino-Yang, Mary Helen] Univ Southern Calif, Brain & Creat Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Yang, Xiao-Fei; Immordino-Yang, Mary Helen] Univ Southern Calif, Rossier Sch Educ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Pavarini, Gabriela] Univ Oxford, Dept Psychiat, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Schnall, Simone] Univ Cambridge, Dept Psychol, Cambridge CB2 3EB, England; [Immordino-Yang, Mary Helen] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Psychol, Neurosci Grad Program, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","Immordino-Yang, MH (reprint author), Univ Southern Calif, 3620A McClintock Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.","immordin@usc.edu","","","Santander Cambridge Scholarship; ESRC [RES-000-22-4453]; NSF CAREER grant [1151920]; Rossier School of Education; USC Provost, Brain and Creativity Institute","This work was supported by a Santander Cambridge Scholarship to G.P.; ESRC grant RES-000-22-4453 to S.S.; NSF CAREER grant 1151920, and support from the USC Provost, Brain and Creativity Institute and Rossier School of Education to MHI-Y.","","61","1","1","3","3","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

Results showed that adolescents' perceptions of sibling closeness were associated with greater neural activation in the anterior insula, ventral striatum and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex when making safe decisions, suggesting that the quality of sibling relationships modulates adolescent neurocognition even without being present. Furthermore, moderated mediation analyses revealed that higher sibling closeness was associated with lower externalizing behavior via left anterior insula activation during safe decision-making, but only for adolescents without older siblings (i.e. eldest children) compared to adolescents who had multiple older siblings.

Mindfulness-defined here as a mental state of receptive attentiveness to internal and external stimuli as they arise, moment-to-moment-may buffer such social distress. However, little research indicates whether mindful individuals adaptively regulate the distress of rejection-or the neural mechanisms underlying this potential capacity. To fill these gaps in the literature, participants reported their trait mindfulness and then completed a social rejection paradigm (Cyberball) while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Approximately 1 hour after the rejection incident, participants reported their level of distress during rejection (i.e. social distress). Mindfulness was associated with less distress during rejection. This relation was mediated by lower activation in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during the rejection incident, a brain region reliably associated with the inhibition of negative affect. Mindfulness was also correlated with less functional connectivity between the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the bilateral amygdala and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, which play a critical role in the generation of social distress. Mindfulness may relate to effective coping with rejection by not over-activating top-down regulatory mechanisms, potentially resulting in more effective long-termemotion-regulation.","[Martelli, Alexandra M.; Chester, David S.; Brown, Kirk Warren] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Psychol, 806 W Franklin St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Eisenberger, Naomi I.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [DeWall, C.

We examined whether functional brain connectivity during social exclusion in the fMRI scanner can be used to predict subsequent conformity to peer norms. Adolescent males (n = 57) completed a two-part study on teen driving risk: a social exclusion task (Cyberball) during an fMRI session and a subsequent driving simulator session in which they drove alone and in the presence of a peer who expressed risk-averse or risk-accepting driving norms. We computed the difference in functional connectivity between social exclusion and social inclusion from each node in the brain to nodes in two brain networks, one previously associated with mentalizing (medial prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal junction, precuneus, temporal poles) and another with social pain (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula). Using predictive modeling, this measure of global connectivity during exclusion predicted the extent of conformity to peer pressure during driving in the subsequent experimental session.

In order to navigate this social world, it is crucial for individuals to learn from and about others. From learning new skills by observing parents perform them tomaking complex collective decisions, understanding the mechanisms underlying social cognitive processes has been of considerable interest to psychologists and neuroscientists. Here, we review studies that have used computational modelling techniques, combined with neuroimaging, to shed light on how people learn and make decisions in social contexts. As opposed to standard social neuroscience methods, the computational approach allows one to directly examine where in the brain particular computations, as estimated by models of behavior, are implemented. Findings suggest that people use several strategies tolearn from others: vicarious reward learning, where one learns from observing the reward outcomes of another agent; action imitation, which relies on encoding a prediction error between the expected and actual actions of the other agent; and social inference, where one learns by inferring the goals and intentions of others. These computations are implemented indistinct neural networks, which may be recruited adaptively depending on task demands, the environment and other social factors.","[Charpentier, Caroline J.; O'Doherty, John P.] CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Charpentier, CJ (reprint author), CALTECH, MC 228-77,1200 E Calif Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.","ccharpen@caltech.edu","","","National Institute of Mental Health [Caltech Conte Center for Social Decision Making]","This work was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health [Caltech Conte Center for Social Decision Making].","","82","0","0","5","5","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1747-0919","1747-0927","","SOC NEUROSCI-UK","Soc.

From a neural viewpoint, a growing body of evidence suggests that the inferior fronto-parietal network, including the mirror neuron system, plays a role in the planning and the understanding of motor intentions. However, it is unclear whether and when the mirror neuron system plays a role in social intentions. Combining a behavioral task with electrical neuroimaging in 22 healthy male participants, the current study investigates whether the temporal brain dynamic of the mirror neuron system differs during two types of social intentions i.e., lust vs. romantic intentions. Our results showed that 62% of the stimuli evoking lustful intentions also evoked romantic intentions, and both intentions were sustained by similar activations of the inferior frontal gyrus and the inferior parietal lobule/angular gyrus for the first 432ms after stimulus onset. Intentions to not love or not lust, on the other hand, were characterized by earlier differential activations of the inferior fronto-parietal network i.e., as early as 244ms after stimulus onset. These results suggest that the mirror neuron system may not only code for the motor correlates of intentions, but also for the social meaning of intentions and its valence at both early/automatic and later/more elaborative stages of information processing.","[Cacioppo, Stephanie] Univ Chicago, Pritzker Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Neurosci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Cacioppo, Stephanie; Monteleone, George] Univ Chicago, Ctr Cognit & Social Neurosci, High Performance Elect Neuroimaging Lab, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Bolmont, Mylene] Univ Geneva, Dept Psychol, Geneva, Switzerland","Cacioppo, S (reprint author), Univ Chicago, 940 E 57th, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.","scacioppo@bsd.uchicago.edu","","","Valeant Pharmaceuticals International [2016-1301]","This work was supported by the Valeant Pharmaceuticals International [2016-1301].","","77","0","0","3","3","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1747-0919","1747-0927","","SOC NEUROSCI-UK","Soc.

However, OFC activity is highly context dependent. It is affected by the extent to which choices are morally justified and whom they concern. In the current study, we specifically focus on contextual factors and investigate the differential role of the OFC during justified and unjustified violence towards ingroup versus outgroup members. Muslims were chosen as the outgroup, as they are currently stereotypically seen as an outgroup and a potential threat by some Non-Muslims. Importantly, we also introduce a context where participants are the actual agents responsible for doing harm. During fMRI scanning, Non-Muslim participants had to decide to either shoot a Non-Muslim (i.e., ingroup member) or Muslim (outgroup member) depending on whether they believed the target was holding a gun or an object. Neuroimaging results showed increased activation in the lateral OFC (lOFC) in the three contrasts that were distressing: 1) during unjustifiable killing; 2) when being killed; and 3) when confronted by an outgroup member with a gun. Together, these results provide important insights into the neurocognitive mechanisms involved in intergroup violence and highlight the critical role of the lOFC in context dependent social decision-making.","[Dominguez, Juan F.

In Studies 1 and 2, we examined participants' moral judgments of allocations based on (1) impartiality, (2) reciprocity, (3) charity and (4) unspecified criteria as depicted in vignettes, as well as participants' perceptions of allocators' motivations. In Study 3, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate how brain regions for ToM were recruited during moral evaluation of the same vignettes. Reciprocity and charity were processed similarly, in that they recruited ToM regions to the same extent, i.e., precuneus, dorsal and ventral medial prefrontal cortex and left temporoparietal junction (LTPJ). In turn, impartiality and the unspecified condition were processed similarly, recruiting the same ToM regions to a lesser extent. Nevertheless, reciprocity elicited greater activity relative to impartiality and unspecified in the ToM regions of interest. Overall, evaluations of different allocation behaviors depend differently on ToM, with charity and reciprocity eliciting greater attention to individuals' unique states and motivations.","[Niemi, Laura] Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, 33 Kirkland St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Wasserman, Emily; Young, Liane] Boston Coll, Dept Psychol, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA","Niemi, L (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, 33 Kirkland St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.","lauraniemi@fas.harvard.edu","","","Alfred P.

The current study used complementary behavioral and neuroimaging approaches to test the hypothesis that intragroup conflict heightens participants' susceptibility to subsequent false memories. Healthy young adults witnessed and later answered questions about events in which the perpetrator and victim were either 1) identified as in-group members relative to each other and the eyewitness, 2) out-group members relative to the eyewitness, but not each other, or 3) out-group members relative to each other (Experiments 1a and 1b). When perpetrators and victims were in-group members (intragroup conflict), participants showed heightened false memory rates. Moreover, false memories increased upon crime realization. Neuroimaging data analysis revealed that salient (as compared to ambiguous) intragroup conflict elicited heightened activation in neural regions associated with resolving cognitive conflict (anterior cingulate cortex; ACC). Increased functional connectivity between the ACC and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex was associated with subsequent false memories (Experiment 2). Results suggest that the social salience of the intragroup conflict may have been associated with participants' increased susceptibility to false memories.","[Carpenter, Alexis C.] Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, 33 Kirkland St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Krendl, Anne C.] Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN USA","Carpenter, AC (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, 33 Kirkland St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.","alexiscarpenter@g.harvard.edu","","Carpenter, Alexis/0000-0003-2198-3977","Hutton Honor's College at Indiana University","This work was supported by the Hutton Honor's College at Indiana University.","","60","0","0","8","22","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1747-0919","1747-0927","","SOC NEUROSCI-UK","Soc.

Although the human amygdala has been implicated in the response to threatening stimuli, no studies to date have investigated whether conservatism is associated with altered amygdala function toward threat. Furthermore, although an influential theory posits that connectivity between the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is important in initiating the response to sustained or uncertain threat, whether individual differences in conservatism modulate this connectivity is unknown. To test whether conservatism is associated with increased reactivity in neural threat circuitry, we measured participants' self-reported social and economic conservatism and asked them to complete high-resolution fMRI scans while under threat of an unpredictable shock and while safe. We found that economic conservatism predicted greater connectivity between the BNST and a cluster of voxels in the left amygdala during threat vs safety. These results suggest that increased amygdala-BNST connectivity during threat may be a key neural correlate of the enhanced negativity bias found in conservatism.","[Pedersen, Walker S.; Larson, Christine L.] Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Dept Psychol, Garland Hall Room 224,2441 E Hartford Ave, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA; [Muftuler, L.

Combining univariate and multivariate analyses, we show a systematic topological organization within STS, with gaze-related activity predominating in the most posterior and superior sector, speech-related activity in the anterior sector and emotional expressions represented in the intermediate middle STS. Right STS appeared to hold a finer functional segregation between all four types of facial movements, and best discriminative abilities within the face-selective posterior STS (pSTS). Conversely, left STS showed greater overlap between conditions, with a lack of distinction between mouth movements associated to speech or happy expression and better discriminative abilities (for gaze and speech vs emotion conditions) outside pSTS. Differential sensitivity to upper (eye) or lower (mouth) facial features may contribute to, but does not appear to fully account for, these response patterns.","[Schobert, Anne-Kathrin; Corradi-Dell'Acqua, Corrado; Vuilleumier, Patrik] Univ Med Ctr, Dept Neurosci, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Schobert, Anne-Kathrin; Corradi-Dell'Acqua, Corrado; Vuilleumier, Patrik] Univ Med Ctr, Clin Neurol, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Schobert, Anne-Kathrin; Corradi-Dell'Acqua, Corrado; Fruhholz, Sascha; Vuilleumier, Patrik] Univ Geneva, Swiss Ctr Affect Sci, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Corradi-Dell'Acqua, Corrado] Univ Geneva, Dept Psychol, FPSE, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Fruhholz, Sascha] Univ Zurich, Dept Psychol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Fruhholz, Sascha] Neurosci Ctr Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Fruhholz, Sascha] Zurich Ctr Integrat Human Physiol ZIHP, Zurich, Switzerland; [van der Zwaag, Wietske] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, CIBM, Lausanne, VD, Switzerland; [van der Zwaag, Wietske] Spinoza Ctr Neuroimaging, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Vuilleumier, P (reprint author), Dept Neurosci, Lab Neurol & Imaging Cognit, 1 Rue Michel Servet, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.","patrik.vuilleumier@unige.ch","Centre d'imagerie Biomedicale, CIBM/B-5740-2012","van der Zwaag, Wietske/0000-0003-3223-9721","Marie-Curie Cofund award BRIDGE from the European Commission [267171]; NCCR in Affective Sciences at the University of Geneva [51NF40-104897]; Geneva Academic Society (Foremane Fund)","This work was supported by a Marie-Curie Cofund award BRIDGE from the European Commission (267171), the NCCR in Affective Sciences at the University of Geneva (51NF40-104897) and the Geneva Academic Society (Foremane Fund).

Using multi-voxel pattern approach, we compared neural pattern similarity for the self and family conditions and found that mothers showed greater perceptual similarity between self and child in the fusiform face area ( FFA), representing high self-child overlap, whereas adolescents showed significantly less self-mother overlap. Adolescents' pattern similarity was dependent upon family relationship quality, such that they showed greater self-mother overlap with higher relationship quality, whereas mothers' pattern similarity was independent of relationship quality. Furthermore, adolescents' perceptual similarity in the FFA was associated with increased social brain activation ( e.g. temporal parietal junction). Mediation analyses indicated that high relationship quality was associated with greater social brain activation, which was mediated by greater self-mother overlap in the FFA. Our findings suggest that adolescents show more distinct neural patterns in perceiving their own vs their mother's distress, and such distinction is sensitive to mother-child relationship quality.

Contemporary models in cognitive neuroscience emphasize the primary role of prefrontal cognitive control networks in aligning behavior with such goals. Here, we use gaze pattern analysis and dynamic functional connectivity fMRI data to explore how individual differences in the ability to resist temptation are related to intrinsic brain dynamics of the cognitive control and salience networks. Behaviorally, individuals exhibit greater gaze distance from target location ( e.g. higher distractibility) during presentation of tempting erotic images compared with neutral images. Individuals whose intrinsic dynamic functional connectivity patterns gravitate toward configurations in which salience detection systems are less strongly coupled with visual systems resist tempting distractors more effectively. The ability to resist tempting distractors was not significantly related to intrinsic dynamics of the cognitive control network. These results suggest that susceptibility to temptation is governed in part by individual differences in salience network dynamics and provide novel evidence for involvement of brain systems outside canonical cognitive control networks in contributing to individual differences in self-control.","[Steimke, Rosa; Stelzel, Christine; Paschke, Lena M.; Walter, Henrik] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy CCM, Div Mind & Brain Res, Berlin, Germany; [Steimke, Rosa; Stelzel, Christine; Paschke, Lena M.; Walter, Henrik] Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Steimke, Rosa; Stelzel, Christine; Paschke, Lena M.; Walter, Henrik] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany; [Steimke, Rosa; Stelzel, Christine; Paschke, Lena M.; Walter, Henrik] Berlin Inst Hlth, Berlin, Germany; [Steimke, Rosa; Goschke, Thomas] Tech Univ Dresden, Dept Psychol, Dresden, Germany; [Steimke, Rosa; Walter, Henrik] Humboldt Univ, Berlin Sch Mind & Brain, Berlin, Germany; [Steimke, Rosa] Humboldt Univ, Dept Psychol, Berlin, Germany; [Steimke, Rosa; Nomi, Jason S.; Uddin, Lucina Q.] Univ Miami, Dept Psychol, POB 248185, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Calhoun, Vince D.] Mind Res Network, Albuquerque, NM 87106 USA; [Calhoun, Vince D.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Stelzel, Christine] Int Psychoanalyt Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Gaschler, Robert] FernUniversitat, Dept Psychol, Hagen, Germany; [Uddin, Lucina Q.] Univ Miami, Miller Sch Med, Neurosci Program, Miami, FL 33136 USA","Uddin, LQ (reprint author), Univ Miami, Dept Psychol, POB 248185, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.","l.uddin@miami.edu","","","Berlin School of Mind and Brain; Humboldt University Berlin; Collaborative Research Centre 'Volition and Cognitive Control' (DFG), Technical University Dresden [SFB 940/1 2013]; National Institute of Mental Health [R01MH107549]; NIH [2R01EB005846, P20GM103472, R01EB020407]; NSF [1539067]","The authors thank the Berlin School of Mind and Brain, the Humboldt University Berlin and the Collaborative Research Centre 'Volition and Cognitive Control' (DFG grant SFB 940/1 2013), Technical University Dresden, for financially supporting the project.

Neural systems active when adults empathize include regions underlying perspective taking (e.g. medial prefrontal cortex; MPFC) and experience sharing (e.g. inferior parietal lobule; IPL). It is unknown whether adolescents utilize networks implicated in both experience sharing and perspective taking when accurately empathizing. This question is critical given the importance of accurately understanding others' emotions for developing and maintaining adaptive peer relationships during adolescence. We extend the literature on empathy in adolescence by determining the neural basis of empathic accuracy, a behavioral assay of empathy that does not bias participants toward the exclusive use of perspective taking or experience sharing. Participants (N = 155, aged 11.1-15.5 years) watched videos of 'targets' describing emotional events and continuously rated the targets' emotions during functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning. Empathic accuracy related to activation in regions underlying perspective taking (MPFC, temporoparietal junction and superior temporal sulcus), while activation in regions underlying experience sharing (IPL, anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula) related to lower empathic accuracy. These results provide novel insight into the neural basis of empathic accuracy in adolescence and suggest that perspective taking processes may be effective for increasing empathy.","[Kral, Tammi R.

Standard analyses for fMRI data typically use general linear models (GLM), which require a priori models of task effects on neural processes. These may inadequately model non-stimulus-locked or temporally overlapping cognitive processes, as mentalizing about other agents. We used the data-driven approach of independent component analysis (ICA) to investigate neural processes involved in a competitive interaction. Participants were confronted with an angry-looking opponent while having to anticipate the trial outcome and the opponent's behaviour. We show that several spatially distinctive neural networks with associated temporal dynamics were modulated by the opponent's facial expression. These results dovetail and extend the main effects observed in the GLM analysis of the same data. Additionally, the ICA approach identified effects of the experimental condition on neural systems during inter-trial intervals. We demonstrate that cognitive processes during aggressive interactions are poorly modelled by simple stimulus onset/duration variables and instead have more complex temporal dynamics. This highlights the utility of using data-driven analyses to elucidate the distinct cognitive processes recruited during complex social paradigms.","[Beyer, Frederike; Kramer, Ulrike M.] Univ Lubeck, Dept Neurol, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany; [Beyer, Frederike; Kramer, Ulrike M.] Univ Lubeck, Inst Psychol 2, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany; [Beyer, Frederike] UCL, Inst Cognit Neurosci, Alexandra House,17 Queen Sq, London WC1N 3AR, England; [Beckmann, Christian F.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Cognit Neurosci, Med Ctr, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Beckmann, Christian F.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Beckmann, Christian F.] Univ Oxford, John Radcliffe Hosp, Oxford Ctr Funct MRI Brain, Nuffield Dept Clin Neurosci, Oxford OX3 9DU, England","Beyer, F (reprint author), UCL, Inst Cognit Neurosci, Alexandra House,17 Queen Sq, London WC1N 3AR, England.","f.beyer@ucl.ac.uk","Beckmann, Christian/E-6374-2012","Kramer, Ulrike M./0000-0002-3841-1812; Beckmann, Christian F./0000-0002-3373-3193","German section of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology; German Research Foundation [KR3691/5-1]; University of Lubeck; German Research Foundation DFG [BE 5779/1-1]; Wellcome Trust UK [098369/Z/12/Z]; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO-Vidi) [864-12-003]","This study was supported by the German section of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology, the German Research Foundation (KR3691/5-1) and through intramural funding by the University of Lubeck.

Previously, we demonstrated that monetary reward and the social reward of good reputation activated the same striatal regions including the caudate nucleus and putamen. However, it remains unclear whether overlapping activations reflect activities of identical neuronal populations or two overlapping but functionally independent neuronal populations. Here, we re-analyzed the original data and addressed this question using multivariate-pattern-analysis and found evidence that in the left caudate nucleus and bilateral nucleus accumbens, social vs monetary reward were represented similarly. The findings suggest that social and monetary rewards are processed by the same population of neurons within these regions of the striatum. Additional findings demonstrated similar neural patterns when participants experience high social reward compared to viewing others receiving low social reward (potentially inducing schadenfreude). This is possibly an early indication that the same population of neurons may be responsible for processing two different types of social reward (good reputation and schadenfreude). These findings provide a supplementary perspective to previous research, helping to further elucidate the mechanisms behind social vs non-social reward processing.","[Wake, Stephanie J.; Izuma, Keise] Univ York, Dept Psychol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England","Izuma, K (reprint author), Univ York, Dept Psychol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.","keise.izuma@york.ac.uk","","","","","","33","7","7","3","11","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

Research has shown that people constantly monitor and adapt to the incoming social-emotional signals, even without face-to-face interaction. And yet, the neural processes underlying such emotional transmissions have not been directly studied. Here, we investigated how the human brain processes emotional cues which arrive from another, co-attending individual. We presented continuous emotional feedback to participants who viewed a movie in the scanner. Participants in the social group (but not in the control group) believed that the feedback was coming from another person who was co-viewing the same movie. We found that social-emotional feedback significantly affected the neural dynamics both in the core affect and in the medial prefrontal regions. Specifically, the response time-courses in those regions exhibited increased similarity across recipients and increased neural alignment with the timeline of the feedback in the social compared with control group. Taken in conjunction with previous research, this study suggests that emotional cues from others shape the neural dynamics across the whole neural continuum of emotional processing in the brain. Moreover, it demonstrates that interpersonal neural alignment can serve as a neural mechanism through which affective information is conveyed between individuals.","[Golland, Yulia; Levit-Binnun, Nava] Sagol Ctr Brain & Mind, Interdisciplinary Ctr Herzliya, Baruch Ivcher Sch Psychol, Herzliyya, Israel; [Hendler, Talma; Lerner, Yulia] Tel Aviv Sourasky Med Ctr, Wohl Inst Adv Imaging, Funct Brain Ctr, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Hendler, Talma] Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Fac Med, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Hendler, Talma] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Psychol Sci, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Hendler, Talma; Lerner, Yulia] Tel Aviv Univ, Sagol Sch Neurosci, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Lerner, Yulia] Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Med, Tel Aviv, Israel","Golland, Y (reprint author), Baruh Ivcher Sch Psychol, Interdisciplinary Ctr IDC Herzliya, Kanfei Nesharim St,POB 167, IL-46150 Herzliyya, Israel.","ygolland@idc.ac.il","","","I-CORE Program of the Planning and Budgeting Committee; Israel Science Foundation [698/15]; Marie Curie CIG Grant; Ministry of Science, Technology and Space","This work was supported by the I-CORE Program of the Planning and Budgeting Committee (TH); Israel Science Foundation 698/15 (YG); Marie Curie CIG Grant (YL); Grant of Ministry of Science, Technology and Space (TH).","","73","1","1","2","7","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

Differences in onset-bound processes are reflected by the degree of explosiveness or steepness of the response at onset, and differences in offset-bound processes by the degree of accumulation or intensification of the subsequent response. Whether onset-and offset-bound processes have distinctive neural correlates and, hence, whether the neural basis of emotions varies over time, still remains unknown. In the present fMRI study, we address this question using a recently developed paradigm that allows to disentangle explosiveness and accumulation. Thirty-one participants were exposed to neutral and negative social feedback, and asked to reflect on its contents. Emotional intensity while reading and thinking about the feedback was measured with an intensity profile tracking approach. Using non-negative matrix factorization, the resulting profile data were decomposed in explosiveness and accumulation components, which were subsequently entered as continuous regressors of the BOLD response. It was found that the neural basis of emotion intensity shifts as emotions unfold over time with emotion explosiveness and accumulation having distinctive neural correlates.","[Resibois, Maxime; Verduyn, Philippe; Kuppens, Peter; Van Mechelen, Iven] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, Tiensestr 102,Box 3713, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Verduyn, Philippe] Maastricht Univ, Fac Psychol & Neurosci, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Delaveau, Pauline; Rotge, Jean-Yves; Fossati, Philippe] UPMC Univ Paris 06, Social & Affect Neurosci SAN Lab & Prisme Platfor, Sorbonne Univ,UMR S 1127,Inst Cerveau & Moelle, Inserm,U1127,CNRS,UMR 7225,ICM A IHU, Paris, France; [Rotge, Jean-Yves; Fossati, Philippe] Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, AP HP, Dept Psychiat, Paris, France; [Fossati, Philippe] UPMC Univ Paris 06, Sorbonne Univ, Ctr NeuroImagerie Rech CENIR, Inserm,CNRS,Hop Pitie Salpetriere,ICM, Blvd Hop, Paris, France","Resibois, M (reprint author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, Tiensestr 102,Box 3713, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.","maxime.resibois@kuleuven.be","","Verduyn, Philippe/0000-0001-8266-2216; kuppens, peter/0000-0002-2363-2356","Research Fund of KU Leuven [GOA/15/003]; Interuniversity Attraction Poles programme - Belgian government [IAP/P7/06]; French National Research Agency (Agence Nationale pour la Recherche) [ANR SAMENTA]","The research leading to the results reported in this paper was supported in part by the Research Fund of KU Leuven (GOA/15/003) and by the Interuniversity Attraction Poles programme financed by the Belgian government (IAP/P7/06).

These dimensions are typically treated as independent in many neuroimaging experiments, yet recent behavioural findings suggest that they are actually interdependent. This result has impact on neuroimaging design, analysis and theoretical development. We were interested in determining the extent of this interdependence both behaviourally and neuroanatomically, as well as teasing apart any activation that is specific to each dimension. While we found extensive overlap in activation for each dimension in traditional emotion areas (bilateral insulae, orbitofrontal cortex, amygdalae), we also found activation specific to each dimension with characteristic relationships between modulations of these dimensions and BOLD signal change. Increases in arousal ratings were related to increased activations predominantly in voice-sensitive cortices after variance explained by valence had been removed. In contrast, emotions of extreme valence were related to increased activations in bilateral voice-sensitive cortices, hippocampi, anterior and midcingulum and medial orbito- and superior frontal regions after variance explained by arousal had been accounted for. Our results therefore do not support a complete segregation of brain structures underpinning the processing of affective dimensions.","[Bestelmeyer, Patricia E.

Although converging evidence emphasises the default mode network (DMN) in mind-wandering, its precise contribution remains unclear. The DMN comprises cortical regions that are maximally distant from primary sensory and motor cortex, a topological location that may support the stimulus-independence of mind-wandering. The DMN is functionally heterogeneous, comprising regions engaged by memory, social cognition and planning; processes relevant to mind-wandering content. Our study examined the relationships between: (i) individual differences in resting-state DMN connectivity, (ii) performance on memory, social and planning tasks and (iii) variability in spontaneous thought, to investigate whether the DMN is critical to mind-wandering because it supports stimulus-independent cognition, memory retrieval, or both. Individual variation in task performance modulated the functional organization of the DMN: poor external engagement was linked to stronger coupling between medial and dorsal subsystems, while decoupling of the core from the cerebellum predicted reports of detailed memory retrieval. Both patterns predicted off-task future thoughts. Consistent with predictions from component process accounts of mind-wandering, our study suggests a 2-fold involvement of the DMN: (i) it supports experiences that are unrelated to the environment through strong coupling between its sub-systems; (ii) it allows memory representations to form the basis of conscious experience.","[Poerio, Giulia L.; Sormaz, Mladen; Wang, Hao-Ting; Jefferies, Elizabeth; Smallwood, Jonathan] Univ Sheffield, Dept Psychol, York Neuroimaging Ctr, Sheffield YO10 5DD, S Yorkshire, England; [Poerio, Giulia L.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Psychol, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Margulies, Daniel] Max Planck Inst Human & Cognit Brain Sci, Neuroanat & Connect Grp, Leipzig, Germany","Poerio, GL (reprint author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Psychol, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.","g.poerio@sheffield.ac.uk","","Jefferies, Elizabeth/0000-0002-3826-4330; Poerio, Giulia/0000-0002-2343-5109; Margulies, Daniel/0000-0002-8880-9204; Smallwood, Jonathan/0000-0002-7298-2459","BBSRC [BB/J006963/1]; European Research Council [SEMBIND-283530, WANDERINGMINDS-646927]; Volkswagen Foundation (Wandering Minds) [89440, 89439]; John Templeton Foundation","E.J. was supported by grants from BBSRC (BB/J006963/1) and the European Research Council (SEMBIND-283530).

Consistent with their culture's valued affect, European Americans trusted and gave more to excited than calm recipients, whereas Koreans trusted and gave more to calm than excited recipients. These findings held regardless of recipient race and sex. We then used fMRI to probe potential affective and mentalizing mechanisms. Increased activity in the nucleus accumbens (associated with reward anticipation) predicted giving, as did decreased activity in the right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ; associated with reduced belief prediction error). Ideal affect match decreased rTPJ activity, suggesting that people may trust and give more to strangers whom they perceive to share their affective values.","[Park, BoKyung; Blevins, Elizabeth; Knutson, Brian; Tsai, Jeanne L.] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, 450 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Tsai, JL (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, 450 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.","jltsai@stanford.edu","","","Stanford Institute for Research in the Social Sciences; Stanford Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging; Kwanjeong Educational Foundation; National Science Foundation [BCS-1324461]","This study was supported by the Stanford Institute for Research in the Social Sciences; the Stanford Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging; Kwanjeong Educational Foundation; and the National Science Foundation (BCS-1324461).","","58","4","4","1","12","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

Yet little is known about the initial detection of moral information. We examined the neural correlates of moral processing during a narrative completion task, which included an implicit moral salience manipulation. During fMRI scanning, participants read a brief vignette and selected the most semantically congruent sentence from two options to complete the narrative. The options were immoral, moral or neutral statements. RT was fastest for the selection of neutral statements and slowest for immoral statements. Neuroimaging analyses revealed that responses involving morally laden content engaged default and executive control network brain regions including medial and rostral prefrontal cortex, and core regions of the salience network, including anterior insula and dorsal anterior cingulate. Immoral moral conditions additionally engaged the salience network. These results implicate the salience network in the detection of moral information, which may modulate downstream default and frontal control network interactions in the service of complex moral reasoning and decision-making processes. These findings suggest that moral cognition involves both bottom-up and top-down attentional processes, mediated by discrete large-scale brain networks and their interactions.","[Sevinc, Gunes; Spreng, R.

The ventral striatum (VS) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) are implicated in subserving reward-related functions that are also associated with the BAS. In this study, we examined whether functional connectivity between these regions predicts components of these scales. We employed resting-state functional connectivity and BIS/BAS scores assessed by a personality questionnaire. Participants completed a resting state run and the Behavioral Inhibition and Activation Systems (BIS/BAS) Questionnaire. Using resting-state BOLD, we assessed correlations between two basal ganglia ROIs (caudate and putamen) and bilateral OFC ROIs, establishing single subject connectivity summary scores. Summary scores were correlated with components of BIS/BAS scores. Results demonstrate a novel correlation between BAS-fun seeking and resting-state connectivity between middle OFC and putamen, implying that spontaneous synchrony between reward-processing regions may play a role in defining personality characteristics related to impulsivity.","[Angelides, Nicholas H.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Psychol, 3210 Tolman Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gupta, Jayesh; Vickery, Timothy J.] Univ Delaware, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, 108 Wolf Hall, Newark, DE 19176 USA","Vickery, TJ (reprint author), Univ Delaware, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, 108 Wolf Hall, Newark, DE 19176 USA.","tvickery@psych.udel.edu","","","University of Delaware Research Foundation; NSF [BCS 1558535, OIA 1632849]","This study was funded by a University of Delaware Research Foundation Grant in conjunction with NSF BCS 1558535 and NSF OIA 1632849 to Timothy Vickery.","","59","1","1","1","3","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

A pool of 56 participants was submitted to an fMRI experimental design involving the presentation of winning and losing football moments of their loved, rival or neutral teams. We found recruitment of amygdala and reward regions, including the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN), as well as other limbic regions involved in emotional cognition, for 'positive vs neutral' and 'positive vs negative' conditions. The latter contrast was correlated with neuropsychological scores of fanaticism in the amygdala and regions within the reward system, as the VTA and SN. The observation of increased response patterns in critical components of the reward system, in particular for positive content related to the loved team, suggests that this kind of non-romantic love reflects a specific arousal and motivational state, which is biased for emotional learning of positive outcomes.","[Duarte, Isabel C.; Afonso, Sonia; Ferreira, Carlos; Castelo-Branco, Miguel] Univ Coimbra, ICNAS, Inst Nucl Sci Appl Hlth, Coimbra, Portugal; [Duarte, Isabel C.; Afonso, Sonia; Jorge, Helena; Ferreira, Carlos; Castelo-Branco, Miguel] Univ Coimbra, Inst Biomed Imaging & Life Sci, CNC IBILI, Coimbra, Portugal; [Cayolla, Ricardo] Univ Aveiro, Dept Econ Management Ind Engn & Tourism, DEGEIT, Aveiro, Portugal","Castelo-Branco, M (reprint author), Univ Coimbra, ICNAS, P-3000548 Coimbra, Portugal.","mcbranco@fmed.uc.pt","","Cipriano Ferreira, Carlos Daniel/0000-0002-0629-7146; Cayolla, Ricardo/0000-0003-4015-7363; Duarte, Isabel Catarina/0000-0002-5620-2424","BRAINTRAIN project [FP7-HEALTH-2013-INNOVATION-1-602186]; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) [FCT-UID/NEU/04539/2013, POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007440]; Bial Foundation [132/12, 133/12, 373/14, CENTRO-07-ST24-FEDER-00205]","This work was supported by, the BRAINTRAIN project FP7-HEALTH-2013-INNOVATION-1-602186, Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) FCT-UID/NEU/04539/2013,-COMPETE, POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007440, Bial Foundation 132/12, 133/12 and 373/14, CENTRO-07-ST24-FEDER-00205.","","45","2","2","1","9","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

The balance model suggests that self-regulation failures result from an imbalance in reward and executive control mechanisms. However, an open question is whether the relative balance of activity in brain systems associated with executive control (vs reward) supports self-regulatory outcomes when people encounter tempting cues in daily life. Sixty-nine chronic dieters, a population known for frequent lapses in self-control, completed a food cue-reactivity task during an fMRI scanning session, followed by a weeklong sampling of daily eating behaviors via ecological momentary assessment. We related participants' food cue activity in brain systems associated with executive control and reward to real-world eating patterns. Specifically, a balance score representing the amount of activity in brain regions associated with self-regulatory control, relative to automatic reward-related activity, predicted dieters' control over their eating behavior during the following week. This balance measure may reflect individual self-control capacity and be useful for examining self-regulation success in other domains and populations.","[Lopez, Richard B.; Chen, Pin-Hao A.; Huckins, Jeremy F.; Kelley, William M.; Heatherton, Todd F.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, 6207 Moore Hall, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Hofmann, Wilhelm] Univ Cologne, Dept Psychol, Cologne, Germany","Lopez, RB (reprint author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, 6207 Moore Hall, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.","richard.b.lopez.gr@dartmouth.edu","","Chen, Pin-Hao Andy/0000-0002-6791-526X","National Institutes of Health, namely the National Institute on Drug Abuse [R01DA022582]; National Cancer Institute [1F31CA177203]","This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health, namely the National Institute on Drug Abuse (R01DA022582) and the National Cancer Institute (1F31CA177203).","","49","8","8","2","12","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

Here, we manipulated perception level of action videos depicting short hand movements and measured the corresponding fMRI BOLD responses in mirror regions. Our results show that activity levels within a network of regions, including the sensorimotor cortex, primary motor cortex, dorsal premotor cortex and posterior superior temporal sulcus, are sensitive to changes in action perception level, whereas activity levels in the inferior frontal gyrus, ventral premotor cortex, supplementary motor area and superior parietal lobule are invariant to such changes. In addition, this parcellation to two sub-networks manifest as smaller functional distances within each group of regions during task and resting state.

Here, we present fMRI data from 20 adult males during a novel cognitive conflict task in which the requirement to scan emotional information was necessary for task performance and held constant across levels of cognitive conflict. Response to fearful facial expressions was attenuated under high (vs low) conflict conditions, as indexed by both slower reaction times and reduced right amygdala response. Psychophysiological interaction analysis showed that increased amygdala response to fear in the low conflict condition was accompanied by increased functional coupling with middle frontal gyrus, a prefrontal region previously associated with emotion regulation during cognitive task performance. These data suggest that amygdala response to emotion is modulated as a function of task demands, even when perceptual inputs are closely matched across load conditions. PPI data also show that, in particular emotional contexts, increased functional coupling of amygdala with prefrontal cortex can paradoxically occur when executive demands are lower.","[Sebastian, Catherine L.] Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Psychol, Egham, Surrey, England; [McCrory, Eamon J.; Viding, Essi] UCL, Educ & Hlth Psychol, London, England; [De Brito, Stephane A.] Univ Birmingham, Sch Psychol, Birmingham, W Midlands, England","Sebastian, CL (reprint author), Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Psychol, Egham, Surrey, England.","","","Sebastian, Catherine/0000-0001-8080-0582","British Academy [SG101362]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K008951/1, RES-062-23-2202]; Royal Society","This work was supported by a British Academy Small Research Grant (SG101362) and an Economic and Social Research Council award (ES/K008951/1) to C.L.S.; and an Economic and Social Research Council award (RES-062-23-2202) to E.V. and E.J.M.

Such attentional priority signals raise a broader question concerning how visual signals are combined with reward signals during learning to create a representation that is sensitive to the confluence of the two. This study examines reward signals during the cued reward training phase commonly used to generate value-driven attentional biases. High, compared with low, reward feedback preferentially activated the value-driven attention network, in addition to regions typically implicated in reward processing. Further examination of these reward signals within the visual system revealed information about the identity of the preceding cue in the caudate tail and LOC, and information about the location of the preceding cue in IPS, while early visual cortex represented both location and identity. The results reveal teaching signals within the value-driven attention network during associative reward learning, and further suggest functional specialization within different regions of this network during the acquisition of an integrated representation of stimulus value.","[Anderson, Brian A.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Psychol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Anderson, BA (reprint author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Psychol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.","brian.anderson@tamu.edu","","","National Institutes of Health [R01-DA013165]","This research was supported by National Institutes of Health grant (R01-DA013165).

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we explored the development of the neural networks involved in social interaction recognition based on human motion in children (8-11), adolescents (13-17), and adults (20-41). Participants watched point-light videos depicting two actors interacting or moving independently and were asked whether these agents were interacting or not. All groups successfully performed the discrimination task, but children had a lower performance and longer response times than the older groups. In all three groups, the posterior parts of the superior temporal sulci and middle temporal gyri, the inferior frontal gyri and the anterior temporal lobes showed greater activation when observing social interactions. In addition, adolescents and adults recruited the caudate nucleus and some frontal regions that are part of the mirror system. Adults showed greater activations in parietal and frontal regions (part of them belonging to the social brain) than adolescents. An increased number of regions that are part of themirror systemnetwork or the social brain, as well as the caudate nucleus, were recruited with age. In conclusion, a shared set of brain regions enabling the discrimination of social interactions from neutralmovements through humanmotion is already present in 8-year-old children.

By 4 years of age, children understand that a person's behavior can be based on a FB about reality. Children cannot understand that a person's emotion can also be based on a FB before the age of six. In order to generate hypothesis on basic processes distinguishing these two types of belief reasoning, the present functional magnetic resonance imaging study in adults directly compares functional activity associated with these two FB tasks. Both tasks were associated with activity in the ToM network including the medial prefrontal cortex and the left temporo-parietal junction. Differential activity was observed in the anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for FB-based emotion relative to behavior attribution. Contrary to FB behavior attribution, FB-based emotion attribution requires the processing of two different mental states: a belief and an emotion and their relation to each other. The activity pattern may reflect the differential demands on cognitive processes associated with the two different belief-based attribution processes. These results shed new light on the still ongoing debate about the nature of the developmental lag between the two FB tasks.","[Doehnel, Katrin; Hajak, Goeran; Rupprecht, Rainer; Sommer, Monika] Univ Regensburg, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Univ Str 84, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany; [Schuwerk, Tobias; Sodian, Beate; Sommer, Monika] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Psychol, Munich, Germany","Sommer, M (reprint author), Univ Regensburg, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Univ Str 84, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany.","monika.sommer@medbo.de","","","","","","68","1","1","2","5","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1747-0919","1747-0927","","SOC NEUROSCI-UK","Soc.

A novel task was developed based on the results of a separate item selection study (n=125). Items were designed to generate dissonance by prompting participants to reflect on everyday personal experiences that were inconsistent with values they had expressed support for. One experimental condition (dissonance) and three control conditions (justification, consonance, and non-self-related inconsistency) were used for comparison. Items of all four types were presented to each participant (n=14) in a randomized design. The fMRI analysis used a whole-brain approach focusing on the moments dissonance was induced. Results showed that in comparison with the control conditions the dissonance experience led to higher levels of activation in several brain regions. Specifically dissonance was associated with increased neural activation in key brain regions including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), anterior insula, inferior frontal gyrus, and precuneus. This supports current perspectives that emphasize the role of anterior cingulate and insula in dissonance processing. Less extensive activation in the prefrontal cortex than in some previous studies is consistent with this study's emphasis on dissonance induction, rather than reduction. This article also contains a short review and comparison with other fMRI studies of cognitive dissonance.","[de Vries, Jan] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Byrne, Mark; Kehoe, Elizabeth] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Trinity Coll Inst Neurosci, Dublin 2, Ireland","de Vries, J (reprint author), Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, 24 DOlier St, Dublin 2, Ireland.","jan.devries@tcd.ie","","de Vries, Jan/0000-0001-5073-895X","Science Foundation Ireland; Trinity College Dublin Start Up Fund [R01333]","Thanks to Sojo Joseph (fMRI technician), Deborah Keane (research assistant), Jeff Cooper (some excellent advice), Simon Dunne (task programmer), and Patricia Devine for allowing us to use the Cognitive Dissonance Measure (Elliot & Devine, 1994).

This study examined whether individuals trained in mindfulness meditation show neural evidence of lower susceptibility to monetary rewards. Seventy-eight participants (34 meditators, 44 matched controls) completed the monetary incentive delay task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. The groups performed equally on the task, but meditators showed lower neural activations in the caudate nucleus during reward anticipation, and elevated bilateral posterior insula activation during reward anticipation. Meditators also evidenced reduced activations in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex during reward receipt compared with controls. Connectivity parameters between the right caudate and bilateral anterior insula were attenuated in meditators during incentive anticipation. In summary, brain regions involved in reward processing-both during reward anticipation and receipt of reward-responded differently in mindfulness meditators than in nonmeditators, indicating that the former are less susceptible to monetary incentives.","[Kirk, Ulrich] Univ Southern Denmark, Inst Psychol, DK-5230 Odense, Denmark; [Brown, Kirk Warren] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Psychol, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Downar, Jonathan] Toronto Western Hosp, Neuropsychiat & Sleep Clin, Toronto, ON M5T 2S8, Canada; [Downar, Jonathan] Univ Toronto, Ctr Addit & Mental Hlth, Toronto, ON M5T 1R8, Canada","Kirk, U (reprint author), Univ Southern Denmark, Inst Psychol, DK-5230 Odense, Denmark.","ukirk@health.sdu.dk","Downar, Jonathan/I-9002-2016","Downar, Jonathan/0000-0002-5140-174X; kirk, ulrich/0000-0002-2121-2016","Kane Family Foundation; National Institute of Health [RO1-DA11723, RO1-MH085496]","We thank Krystle Bartley, Carrie Howard, Christine Cortelyou and Monica Alexander for data collection, Mark Ross and Nathan Apple for implementing the NEMO experiment client (http://labs.vtc.vt.edu/hnl/nemo/) and Claudia Bracero for administrative assistance.

In the present study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore how scrambled sentence priming can impact on mimicry behavior. Sentences involving pro/antisocial events from a first/third-person point of view were presented in short blocks, followed by a reaction-time assessment of mimicry. Behavioral results showed that both prosociality and viewpoint impact on mimicry, and fMRI analysis showed this effect is implemented by anterior medial prefrontal cortex (amPFC). We suggest that social primes may subtly modulate processing in amPFC in a manner linked to the later behavior, and that this same region also implements the top-down control of mimicry responses. This priming may be linked to processing of self-schemas in amPFC. Our findings demonstrate how social priming can be studied with fMRI, and have important implications for our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of prime-to-behavior effects as well as for current theories in social psychology.","[Wang, Yin; Hamilton, Antonia F. de C.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Psychol, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England","Wang, Y (reprint author), Univ Nottingham, Sch Psychol, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.","mirrorneuronwang@gmail.com","","Hamilton, Antonia/0000-0001-8000-0219","Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/J006793/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J006793/1]","This work was supported by Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Small Research Grant ES/J006793/1 (to A.H.).","","39","17","17","1","12","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

However, the networks underlying the moral decisions about corporations and people are strikingly similar, including regions of the canonical theory of mind network. In analyzing the activity in these networks, we found differences in the emotional processing of these two types of vignettes: neutral actions of corporations showed neural correlates that more closely resembled negative actions than positive actions.

Although music constitutes another powerful means to express emotions, the neural substrates involved in its processing remain poorly understood. In particular, it is unknown whether brain regions typically associated with processing 'biologically relevant' emotional expressions are also recruited by emotional music. To address this question, we conducted an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study in 47 healthy volunteers in which we directly compared responses to basic emotions (fear, sadness and happiness, as well as neutral) expressed through faces, non-linguistic vocalizations and short novel musical excerpts. Our results confirmed the importance of fear in emotional communication, as revealed by significant blood oxygen level-dependent signal increased in a cluster within the posterior amygdala and anterior hippocampus, as well as in the posterior insula across all three domains. Moreover, subject-specific amygdala responses to fearful music and vocalizations were correlated, consistent with the proposal that the brain circuitry involved in the processing of musical emotions might be shared with the one that have evolved for vocalizations. Overall, our results show that processing of fear expressed through music, engages some of the same brain areas known to be crucial for detecting and evaluating threat-related information.","[Aube, William; Peretz, Isabelle; Concha, Luis; Armony, Jorge L.] Int Lab Brain Mus & Sound Res BRAMS, Montreal, PQ H2V 4P3, Canada; [Aube, William; Peretz, Isabelle; Armony, Jorge L.] CRBLM, Montreal, PQ H3G 2A8, Canada; [Aube, William; Peretz, Isabelle] Univ Montreal, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ H2V 2S9, Canada; [Angulo-Perkins, Arafat; Concha, Luis] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Queretaro 76230, Mexico; [Armony, Jorge L.] McGill Univ, Dept Psychiat, Montreal, PQ H4H 1R3, Canada; [Armony, Jorge L.] McGill Univ, Douglas Mental Hlth Univ Inst, Montreal, PQ H4H 1R3, Canada","Aube, W (reprint author), Univ Montreal, BRAMS, Pavillon 1420,Blvd Mt Royal,CP 6128 Succ Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.","william.aube@umontreal.ca","","Concha, Luis/0000-0002-7842-3869","National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia de Mexico (CONACyT); Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM); NSERC; CONACyT-UNAM","This work was partly funded by grants from the National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) to J.L.A., and from Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia de Mexico (CONACyT) and Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM) to L.C.

In the present study, pairs of participants were asked to rate and communicate the degree of their emotional arousal while viewing affective pictures. Strikingly, participants adjusted their arousal ratings to match up with their interaction partner. In anticipation of the affective picture, the interaction partner's arousal ratings correlated positively with activity in anterior insula and prefrontal cortex. During picture presentation, social influence was reflected in the ventral striatum, that is, activity in the ventral striatum correlated negatively with the interaction partner's ratings.

Furthermore, we show that this pattern of activation not only holds for directly experienced social pain, but also during empathy for social pain. Finally, we report that subgenual cingulate cortex is the only brain area conjointly active during empathy for physical and social pain.

Participants were scanned (fMRI) while taking part in triadic communication involving two recipients and a speaker. The speaker uttered sentences that were and were not accompanied by complementary iconic gestures. Crucially, the speaker alternated her gaze direction, thus creating two recipient roles: addressed (direct gaze) vs unaddressed (averted gaze) recipient. The comprehension of Speech&Gesture relative to SpeechOnly utterances recruited middle occipital, middle temporal and inferior frontal gyri, bilaterally. The calcarine sulcus and posterior cingulate cortex were sensitive to differences between direct and averted gaze.

Accordingly, we hypothesized that to the extent that non-predictive gaze and arrow cues automatically engender expectations with regard to cue location, they should activate the ventral attention network when they cue attention invalidly. Using event-related fMRI, we found that invalid gaze but not arrow cues activated the ventral attention network, specifically in the area of the right temporal parietal junction (TPJ), as well as nodes along the dorsal attention network associated with a redirection of attention to the correct target location. In additional whole-brain analyses, facilitation of behavioral response time by valid gaze cues was linearly associated with the degree of activation in the right TPJ. We conclude from our findings that gaze direction elicits potent expectations in humans with regard to an actor's intention that engage attention networks if not differently from, at least more robustly than, arrow cues.","[Joseph, Robert M.; Fricker, Zachary] Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, Boston, MA 02118 USA; [Fricker, Zachary] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Med, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Keehn, Brandon] Boston Childrens Hosp, Labs Cognit Neurosci, Div Dev Med, Boston, MA USA","Joseph, RM (reprint author), Boston Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anat & Neurobiol, 72 E Concord St,L 816, Boston, MA 02118 USA.","rmjoseph@bu.edu","","Keehn, Brandon/0000-0001-8796-2250; Joseph, Robert/0000-0001-6879-0254","National Institute of Mental Health [K01 MH 073944]","This research was supported by a National Institute of Mental Health award (K01 MH 073944) to R.M.J.","","34","9","9","1","10","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

In this study, we examined whether OT increases empathy by the way of blurring the distinction between self and other, or by enhancing the difference between self and other. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject crossover design, empathic responses of healthy participants were compared when imagining oneself (i.e., self-perspective empathy) versus when imagining the other (i.e., other-perspective empathy) in painful and nonpainful situations. Under OT treatment, participants expressed more empathy when imagining others than when imagining oneself in pain. This was in contrast to the placebo condition where there were no differences between the empathic responses during the self- and the other-perspective. We propose that the modulatory effect of OT on empathy when taking the other-perspective may be mediated by its role in self- and other-distinctiveness and corollary by its role in increasing salience to social agents and cues.","[Abu-Akel, Ahmad] Univ Birmingham, Sch Psychol, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Palgi, Sharon; Shamay-Tsoory, Simone] Univ Haifa, Dept Psychol, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel; [Klein, Ehud] Rambam Med Ctr, Haifa, Israel; [Decety, Jean] Univ Chicago, Dept Psychol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Decety, Jean] Univ Chicago, Dept Psychiat & Behav Neurosci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Abu-Akel, A (reprint author), Univ Birmingham, Sch Psychol, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.","ama289@bham.ac.uk","","Abu-Akel, Ahmad/0000-0003-3791-8643","Binational Science Foundation (BSF); John Templeton Foundation","This research was supported by the Binational Science Foundation (BSF) to SST and JD.

Sensing active listening in social interactions is accompanied by an improvement in the recollected impressions of relevant experiences and is thought to arouse positive feelings. We therefore hypothesized that the recognition of active listening activates the reward system, and that the emotional appraisal of experiences that had been subject to active listening would be improved. To test these hypotheses, we conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on participants viewing assessments of their own personal experiences made by evaluators with or without active listening attitude. Subjects rated evaluators who showed active listening more positively. Furthermore, they rated episodes more positively when they were evaluated by individuals showing active listening. Neural activation in the ventral striatum was enhanced by perceiving active listening, suggesting that this was processed as rewarding. It also activated the right anterior insula, representing positive emotional reappraisal processes. Furthermore, the mentalizing network was activated when participants were being evaluated, irrespective of active listening behavior. Therefore, perceiving active listening appeared to result in positive emotional appraisal and to invoke mental state attribution to the active listener.","[Kawamichi, Hiroaki; Sasaki, Akihiro T.; Sugawara, Sho K.; Tanabe, Hiroki C.; Sadato, Norihiro] Natl Inst Nat Sci, Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Dept Cerebral Res, Div Cerebral Integrat, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan; [Yoshihara, Kazufumi] Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci, Dept Psychosomat Med, Fukuoka 8128582, Japan; [Tanabe, Hiroki C.] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Dept Social & Human Environm, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Shinohara, Ryoji; Sugisawa, Yuka; Tokutake, Kentaro; Mochizuki, Yukiko; Anme, Tokie] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Comprehens Human Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058575, Japan","Kawamichi, H (reprint author), 38 Nishigo Naka, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan.","kawami@nips.ac.jp","U-ID, Kyushu/C-5291-2016; Sasaki, Akihiro/C-3658-2017","Sasaki, Akihiro/0000-0002-2249-4975; Kawamichi, Hiroaki/0000-0002-6172-8906","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan (MEXT) [23101507, 22101007]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [21220005, 23700505, 25750407]; MEXT","This study was partly supported by Scientific Research on Innovative Areas grants [#23101507] (to H.K.) and [#22101007] (to H.C.T.) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan (MEXT), by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (S) [#21220005] (to N.S.) and by Grants-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) [#23700505] and [#25750407] (to H.K.) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.

Using fMRI and a variant of the ultimatum game and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated how the brain differentially responds to fairness in loss and gain domains. Participants (responders) received offers from anonymous partners indicating a division of an amount of monetary gain or loss. If they accept, both get their shares according to the division; if they reject, both get nothing or lose the entire stake. We used a computational model to derive perceived fairness of offers and participant-specific inequity aversion. Behaviorally, participants were more likely to reject unfair offers in the loss (vs gain) domain. Neurally, the positive correlation between fairness and activation in ventral striatum was reduced, whereas the negative correlations between fairness and activations in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were enhanced in the loss domain. Moreover, rejection-related dorsal striatum activation was higher in the loss domain. Furthermore, the gain-loss domain modulates costly punishment only when unfair behavior was directed toward the participants and not when it was directed toward others. These findings provide neural and computational accounts of increased costly norm enforcement under adversity and advanced our understanding of the context-dependent nature of fairness preference.","[Wu, Yan] Hangzhou Normal Univ, Sch Educ Sci, Dept Psychol, Hangzhou 310036, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yan; Yu, Hongbo; Shen, Bo; Zhou, Zhiheng; Zhang, Guoping; Zhou, Xiaolin] Peking Univ, Ctr Brain & Cognit Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yan; Yu, Hongbo; Shen, Bo; Zhou, Zhiheng; Zhang, Guoping; Zhou, Xiaolin] Peking Univ, Dept Psychol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Yu, Rongjun] S China Normal Univ, Sch Psychol, Guangzhou 510631, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yu, Rongjun] S China Normal Univ, Ctr Studies Psychol Applicat, Guangzhou 510631, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Guoping] Nankai Univ, China Acad Corp Governance, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Guoping] Sch Business, China Acad Corp Governance, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Yushi] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Chengdu 610031, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xiaolin] Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Machine Percept, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xiaolin] Peking Univ, PKU IDG McGovern Inst Brain Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","Zhou, XL (reprint author), Peking Univ, Dept Psychol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.","xz104@pku.edu.cn","","Yu, Rongjun/0000-0003-0123-1524","National Basic Research Program (973 Program) [2010CB833904]; Natural Science Foundation of China [30110972, 91232708, 71172216, 71132001, 31100744]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [20100470156, 2012T50023]","This study was supported by National Basic Research Program (973 Program: 2010CB833904), by grants from the Natural Science Foundation of China (30110972, 91232708, 71172216, 71132001, 31100744) and from the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (20100470156, 2012T50023).

We addressed these gaps by experimentally inducing felt understanding and not understanding as participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging. The results demonstrated that feeling understood activated neural regions previously associated with reward and social connection (i.e. ventral striatum and middle insula), while not feeling understood activated neural regions previously associated with negative affect (i.e. anterior insula). Both feeling understood and not feeling understood activated different components of the mentalizing system (feeling understood: precuneus and temporoparietal junction; not feeling understood: dorsomedial prefrontal cortex). Neural responses were associated with subsequent feelings of social connection and disconnection and were modulated by individual differences in rejection sensitivity. Thus, this study provides insight into the psychological processes underlying feeling understood (or not) and may suggest new avenues for targeted interventions that amplify the benefits of feeling understood or buffer individuals from the harmful consequences of not feeling understood.","[Morelli, Sylvia A.] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Torre, Jared B.; Eisenberger, Naomi I.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Morelli, SA (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Jordan Hall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.","smorelli@stanford.edu","","","UCLA Brain Mapping Center","The authors are grateful to Andrew Gularte, Consuelo Rivera, and Molly Arnn for their help with data collection and analysis.

Despite the prevalence of such goal-directed simulations, neuroimaging studies on planning have mainly focused on executive processes in the frontal lobe. This experiment examined the neural basis of process simulations, during which participants imagined themselves going through steps toward attaining a goal, and outcome simulations, during which participants imagined events they associated with achieving a goal. In the scanner, participants engaged in these simulation tasks and an odd/even control task. We hypothesized that process simulations would recruit default and frontoparietal control network regions, and that outcome simulations, which allow us to anticipate the affective consequences of achieving goals, would recruit default and reward-processing regions. Our analysis of brain activity that covaried with process and outcome simulations confirmed these hypotheses. A functional connectivity analysis with posterior cingulate, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior inferior parietal lobule seeds showed that their activity was correlated during process simulations and associated with a distributed network of default and frontoparietal control network regions. During outcome simulations, medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala seeds covaried together and formed a functional network with default and reward-processing regions.","[Gerlach, Kathy D.; Madore, Kevin P.; Schacter, Daniel L.] Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Spreng, R.

When participants simply viewed these images, results revealed few effects of valence or attention. However, when participants engaged in reappraisal, there was a robust effect of valence, with the reappraisal of negative relative to positive images associated with more widespread activation, including within regions of medial and lateral PFC. There also was an effect of attention, with more lateral PFC recruitment when regulating with full attention and more medial PFC recruitment when regulating with divided attention. Within two regions of medial PFC and one region of ventrolateral PFC, there was an interaction between valence and attention: in these regions, divided attention reduced activity during reappraisal of positive but not negative images. Critically, participants continued to report reappraisal success even during the Divided Attention condition.

Traditional theories assume that our knowledge is represented abstractly in an amodal conceptual network of formal logic symbols. The theory of embodied cognition challenges this view and argues that conceptual representations that constitute our knowledge are grounded in sensory and motor experiences. We tested this hypothesis by examining how the concept of social coordination is grounded metaphorically in the tactile sensation of roughness. Participants experienced rough or smooth touch before being asked to judge an ambiguous social interaction. Results revealed that rough touch made social interactions appear more difficult and adversarial, consistent with the rough metaphor. This impact of tactile cues on social impressions was accompanied by a network including primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, amygdala, hippocampus and inferior prefrontal cortex. Thus, the roughness of tactile stimulation affected metaphor-relevant (but not metaphor-irrelevant) behavioral and neural responses. Receiving touch from a rough object seems to trigger the application of associated ontological concepts (or scaffolds) even for unrelated people and situations (but not to unrelated or more general feelings).

Participants rated whether each statement was descriptive or not and endorsed positive frames more than negative frames. Individual differences on frame decisions enabled us to form high and low frame susceptibility groups. Endorsement of frame-consistent attributes was associated with personality factors, cognitive reflection and intelligence. Reflexive brain regions were associated with positive frames while reflective areas were associated with negative frames. Region of Interest analyses showed that frame-inconsistent responses were associated with increased activation within reflective cognitive control regions including the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsomedial PFC and left ventrolateral PFC. Frame-consistent responses were associated with increased activation in the right orbitofrontal cortex.

Although individual studies have driven this progress, meta-analyses provide an opportunity to test hypotheses that require large collections of data. We carry out a meta-analysis of a large set of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of value computation to address several key questions. First, what is the full set of brain areas that reliably correlate with stimulus values when they need to be computed? Second, is this set of areas organized into dissociable functional networks? Third, is a distinct network of regions involved in the computation of stimulus values at decision and outcome? Finally, are different brain areas involved in the computation of stimulus values for different reward modalities? Our results demonstrate the centrality of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), ventral striatum and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in the computation of value across tasks, reward modalities and stages of the decision-making process. We also find evidence of distinct subnetworks of co-activation within VMPFC, one involving central VMPFC and dorsal PCC and another involving more anterior VMPFC, left angular gyrus and ventral PCC. Finally, we identify a posterior-to-anterior gradient of value representations corresponding to concrete-to-abstract rewards.","[Clithero, John A.; Rangel, Antonio] CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Rangel, Antonio] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Clithero, JA (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, MC 228-77, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.","clithero@hss.caltech.edu","","Clithero, John/0000-0002-7114-4621","National Science Foundation; Lipper Foundation; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation","We acknowledge funding from the National Science Foundation, the Lipper Foundation and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.","","149","198","198","3","35","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

The discrepancy between a hypothetical answer and the real act is called hypothetical bias. We investigated neural processes of hypothetical bias regarding monetary donations to public goods using fMRI with the hypothesis that amygdala codes for real costs. Real decisions activated amygdala more than hypothetical decisions. This was observed for both accepted and rejected proposals. The more the subjects accepted real donation proposals the greater was the activity in rostral anterior cingulate cortex-a region known to control amygdala but also neural processing of the cost-benefit difference. The presentation of a charitable donation goal evoked an insula activity that predicted the later decision to donate. In conclusion, we have identified the neural mechanisms underlying real donation behavior, compatible with theories on hypothetical bias.

We combined a TPP task with functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate how lay people's BFW might affect their punishment of hypothetical criminal offenses varying in affective content. Our results revealed that people with strong BFW punished more harshly than people with weak BFW, but only in low affective cases, likely driven by a more robust commitment to moral responsibility. This effect was mirrored by a stronger activation in the right temporo-parietal junction, a region presumably involved in attentional selection to salient stimuli and attribution of temporary intentions and beliefs of others. But, for high affective cases, the BFW-based behavioral and neural differences disappeared. Both groups similarly punished high affective cases and showed higher activation in the right insula. The right insula is typically activated during aversive interoceptive-emotional processing for extreme norm violations. Our results demonstrated that the impact of BFW on TPP is context-dependent; perhaps explaining in part why the philosophical debate between free will and determinism is so stubbornly persistent.","[Krueger, Frank] George Mason Univ, Dept Mol Neurosci, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Krueger, Frank] George Mason Univ, Dept Psychol, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Hoffman, Morris] State Colorado, Judicial Dist 2, Denver, CO USA; [Hoffman, Morris] John D & Catherine T MacArthur Fdn Res Network La, Nashville, TN USA; [Walter, Henrik] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Div Mind & Brain Res, Berlin, Germany; [Grafman, Jordan] Rehabil Inst Chicago, Brain Injury Res Program, Chicago, IL 60611 USA","Krueger, F (reprint author), George Mason Univ, Dept Mol Neurosci, 4400 Univ Dr,Mail Stop 2A1, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.","FKrueger@gmu.edu","Walter, Henrik/O-2612-2013","","CNS/NINDS/NIH","The authors are grateful to E.

The level of pain voluntarily taken and the activations in anterior middle cingulate cortex (aMCC) and bilateral anterior insula (AI) were higher when the participant was solely responsible for the stimulation (Self_Incorrect) than when both committed an error (Both_Incorrect). Moreover, the gray matter volume in the aMCC predicted the individual's compensation behavior, measured as the difference between the level of pain taken in the Self_Incorrect and Both_Incorrect conditions. Furthermore, a mediation pathway analysis revealed that activation in a midbrain region mediated the relationship between aMCC activation and the individual's tendency to compensate. These results demonstrate that the aMCC and the midbrain nucleus not only play an important role in experiencing interpersonal guilt, but also contribute to compensation behavior.","[Yu, Hongbo; Hu, Jie; Zhou, Xiaolin] Peking Univ, Ctr Brain & Cognit Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Yu, Hongbo; Hu, Jie; Zhou, Xiaolin] Peking Univ, Dept Psychol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Hu, Li] Southwest Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Cognit & Personal, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China; [Hu, Li] Southwest Univ, Sch Psychol, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xiaolin] Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Machine Percept, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xiaolin] Peking Univ, PKU IDG McGovern Inst Brain Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","Zhou, XL (reprint author), Peking Univ, Dept Psychol, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.","xz104@pku.edu.cn","","Yu, Hongbo/0000-0002-3384-7772","National Basic Research Program from the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (973 Program) [2010CB833904]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [30110972, 91232708]","This study was supported by National Basic Research Program from the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (973 Program: 2010CB833904) and by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (30110972, 91232708).","","59","19","23","4","25","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

Yet, it is not well understood how social relationships influence neural responses to other persons' gains. In this study, we investigated neural responses during a gambling task in which healthy participants (N = 31; 18 females) could win or lose money for themselves, their best friend or a disliked other (antagonist). At the moment of receiving outcome, person-related activity was observed in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), precuneus and temporal parietal junction (TPJ), showing higher activity for friends and antagonists than for self, and this activity was independent of outcome. The only region showing an interaction between the person-participants played for and outcome was the ventral striatum. Specifically, the striatum was more active following gains than losses for self and friends, whereas for the antagonist this pattern was reversed. Together, these results show that, in a context with social and reward information, social aspects are processed in brain regions associated with social cognition (mPFC, TPJ), and reward aspects are processed in primary reward areas (striatum). Furthermore, there is an interaction of social and reward information in the striatum, such that reward-related activity was dependent on social relationship.","[Braams, Barbara R.; Guroglu, Berna; de Water, Erik; Meuwese, Rosa; Koolschijn, P.

In this study, we tested the novel hypothesis that men and women differ in the neural correlates of affective experience, rather than in the intensity of neural activity, with women being more internally (interoceptively) focused and men being more externally (visually) focused. Adult men (n = 17) and women (n = 17) completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging study while viewing affectively potent images and rating their moment-to-moment feelings of subjective arousal. We found that men and women do not differ overall in their intensity of moment-to-moment affective experiences when viewing evocative images, but instead, as predicted, women showed a greater association between the momentary arousal ratings and neural responses in the anterior insula cortex, which represents bodily sensations, whereas men showed stronger correlations between their momentary arousal ratings and neural responses in the visual cortex. Men also showed enhanced functional connectivity between the dorsal anterior insula cortex and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, which constitutes the circuitry involved with regulating shifts of attention to the world. These results demonstrate that the same affective experience is realized differently in different people, such that women's feelings are relatively more self-focused, whereas men's feelings are relatively more world-focused.","[Moriguchi, Yoshiya] Natl Ctr Neurol & Psychiat, Dept Psychophysiol, Natl Inst Mental Hlth, Kodaira, Tokyo 1870031, Japan; [Moriguchi, Yoshiya] Natl Ctr Neurol & Psychiat, Integrat Brain Imaging Ctr, Kodaira, Tokyo 1870031, Japan; [Moriguchi, Yoshiya; Touroutoglou, Alexandra; Dickerson, Bradford C.; Barrett, Lisa Feldman] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Moriguchi, Yoshiya; Touroutoglou, Alexandra; Dickerson, Bradford C.; Barrett, Lisa Feldman] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Touroutoglou, Alexandra; Barrett, Lisa Feldman] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Psychiat Neuroimaging Res Program, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Dickerson, Bradford C.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Barrett, Lisa Feldman] Northeastern Univ, Dept Psychol, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Moriguchi, Y (reprint author), Natl Ctr Neurol & Psychiat, Dept Psychophysiol, Natl Inst Mental Hlth, 4-1-1 Ogawahigashi, Kodaira, Tokyo 1870031, Japan.","ymorigu@ncnp.go.jp","","","National Institutes of Health [DP10D003312]; National Institute on Aging [R01 AG030311];  [R01-AG029480];  [NCRR P41-RR14075];  [1S10RR023401];  [1S10RR019307];  [1S10RR023043]","This work was supported in part by the National Institutes of Health Director's Pioneer Award (DP10D003312) and a National Institute on Aging grant (R01 AG030311) to L.

The present study investigates the neural substrates of autobiographical reasoning, a process central to the construction of such narratives. During functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning, participants approached a set of personally significant memories in two different ways: in some trials, they remembered the concrete content of the events (autobiographical remembering), whereas in other trials they reflected on the broader meaning and implications of their memories (autobiographical reasoning). Relative to remembering, autobiographical reasoning recruited a left-lateralized network involved in conceptual processing [including the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), inferior frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus and angular gyrus]. The ventral MPFC-an area that may function to generate personal/affective meaning-was not consistently engaged during autobiographical reasoning across participants but, interestingly, the activity of this region was modulated by individual differences in interest and willingness to engage in self-reflection. These findings support the notion that autobiographical reasoning and the construction of personal narratives go beyond mere remembering in that they require deriving meaning and value from past experiences.","[D'Argembeau, Arnaud; Cassol, Helena; Van der Linden, Martial] Univ Liege, Dept Psychol, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [D'Argembeau, Arnaud; Phillips, Christophe; Balteau, Evelyne; Salmon, Eric] Univ Liege, Cyclotron Res Ctr, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Phillips, Christophe] Univ Liege, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Van der Linden, Martial] Univ Geneva, Dept Psychol, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland","D'Argembeau, A (reprint author), Univ Liege, Dept Psychol Cognit & Behav, Blvd Rectorat 3 B33, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.","a.dargembeau@ulg.ac.be","","Phillips, Christophe/0000-0002-4990-425X; D'Argembeau, Arnaud/0000-0003-3618-9768; Salmon, Eric/0000-0003-2520-9241","French speaking community of Belgium (ARC) [12/17-01-REST]; National Fund for Scientific Research (FRS-FNRS), Belgium","This work was supported by the French speaking community of Belgium (ARC, Convention 12/17-01-REST) and the National Fund for Scientific Research (FRS-FNRS), Belgium.

Ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) has routinely been implicated in social cognitive tasks that rely on such absolute judgments about the self or others, but it is unclear whether activity in this region is modulated by personal relevance of social stimuli or self-similarity of judgment targets. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate that these forces interact to determine vmPFC response during social comparisons, as well as neural activity in the bilateral anterior insulae. Comparisons between the self and similar others exhibit a unique response in this region when compared with other judgment contexts, suggesting that the special psychological status afforded to these social comparisons is indexed by activity in the vmPFC and insula.","[Moore, William E., III; Merchant, Junaid S.; Kahn, Lauren E.; Pfeifer, Jennifer H.] Univ Oregon, Dept Psychol, Eugene, OR 97401 USA","Moore, WE (reprint author), Univ Oregon, Dept Psychol, Eugene, OR 97401 USA.","wem3@uoregon.edu","","Moore, Will/0000-0002-7012-7803","NICHD NIH HHS [L40HD059442]; NIMH NIH HHS [L40 MH087356, L40MH087356]","","","34","11","11","0","12","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

Moral emotions are, however, difficult to study with neuroimaging methods because their elicitation is more intricate than that of basic emotions. Here, using functional MRI (fMRI), we employed a novel social prejudice paradigm to examine specific brain regions associated with real-time moral emotion, focusing on guilt and related moral-negative emotions. The paradigm induced intense moral-negative emotion (primarily guilt) in 22 low-prejudice individuals through preprogrammed feedback indicating implicit prejudice against Black and disabled people. fMRI data indicated that this experience of moral-negative emotion was associated with increased activity in anterior paralimbic structures, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insula, in addition to areas associated with mentalizing, including the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus. Of significance was prominent conflict-related activity in the supragenual ACC, which is consistent with theories proposing an association between acute guilt and behavioral inhibition. Finally, a significant negative association between self-reported guilt and neural activity in the pregenual ACC suggested a role of self-regulatory processes in response to moral-negative affect. These findings are consistent with the multifaceted self-regulatory functions of moral-negative emotions in social behavior.","[Fourie, Melike M.; Thomas, Kevin G.

However, the question still remains whether this increase in MPFC activation for in-group representation is solely related with previous experience with the in-group. To test this, we randomly assigned participants to a red or blue team and in a subsequent functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment they categorized red and blue team words as belonging to either the in-group or the out-group. Results showed that even under these minimal conditions increased activation was found in the MPFC when participants indicated that they belonged to a group, as compared with when they did not.

Psychophysiological interaction analyses showed that amygdala activation was associated with task-specific (fearful faces greater than houses) modulation of an attention network, including bilateral pulvinar, bilateral insula, left frontal eye fields, left intraparietal sulcus and early visual cortex. Furthermore, we report an unexpected main effect of increased left parietal cortex activation associated with suppressed fearful faces compared to suppressed houses.

Activations were found for both of these emotions in the temporal lobe (shame condition: anterior cingulate cortex, parahippocampal gyrus; guilt condition: fusiform gyrus, middle temporal gyrus). Specific activations were found for shame in the frontal lobe (medial and inferior frontal gyrus), and for guilt in the amygdala and insula. This is consistent with Takahashi et al.'s results obtained for a Japanese sample (using Japanese stimuli), which showed activations in the fusiform gyrus, hippocampus, middle occipital gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus. During the imagination of shame, frontal and temporal areas (e. g. middle frontal gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus) were responsive regardless of gender. In the guilt condition, women only activate temporal regions, whereas men showed additional frontal and occipital activation as well as a responsive amygdala. The results suggest that shame and guilt share some neural networks, as well as having individual areas of activation. It can be concluded that frontal, temporal and limbic areas play a prominent role in the generation of moral feelings.","[Michl, Petra; Meister, Franziska; Engel, Rolf R.; Hennig-Fast, Kristina] Univ Munich, Dept Psychiat, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Meindl, Thomas; Born, Christine; Reiser, Maximilian] Univ Munich, Dept Radiol, Munich, Germany","Hennig-Fast, K (reprint author), LMU Munich Univ, Dept Psychiat, Sect Neurocognit, Nussbaumstr 7, D-80336 Munich, Germany.","kristina.fast@med.uni-muenchen.de","","Engel, Rolf/0000-0001-8022-3228","","","","60","32","34","4","33","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

Emotional response is composed of a number of factors, two of which are the initial reactivity to an emotional stimulus and the subsequent recovery once the stimulus terminates or ceases to be relevant. However, most neuroimaging studies examining emotional processing in humans focus on the magnitude of initial reactivity to a stimulus rather than the prolonged response. In this study, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging to study the time course of amygdala activity in healthy adults in response to presentation of negative images. We split the amygdala time course into an initial reactivity period and a recovery period beginning after the offset of the stimulus. We find that initial reactivity in the amygdala does not predict trait measures of affective style. Conversely, amygdala recovery shows predictive power such that slower amygdala recovery from negative images predicts greater trait neuroticism, in addition to lower levels of likability of a set of social stimuli (neutral faces). These data underscore the importance of taking into account temporal dynamics when studying affective processing using neuroimaging.","[Schuyler, Brianna S.; Kral, Tammi R.

Adventure racers are elite athletes that operate in small teams in the context of environmental and physical extremes. In particular, awareness of team member's emotional status is critical to the team's ability to navigate high-magnitude stressors. Thus, this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study examined the hypothesis that adventure racers would show altered emotion processing in brain areas that are important for resilience and social awareness. Elite adventure racers (n = 10) were compared with healthy volunteers (n = 12) while performing a simple emotion face-processing (modified Hariri) task during fMRI. Across three types of emotional faces, adventure racers showed greater activation in right insula, left amygdala and dorsal anterior cingulate. Additionally, compared with healthy controls adventure racers showed attenuated right medial prefrontal cortex activation. These results are consistent with previous studies showing elite performers differentially activate neural substrates underlying interoception. Thus, adventure racers differentially deploy brain resources in an effort to recognize and process the internal sensations associated with emotions in others, which could be advantageous for team-based performance under stress.","[Thom, Nathaniel J.; Johnson, Douglas C.; Van Orden, Karl F.; Potterat, Eric G.; Swain, Judith L.; Paulus, Martin P.] OptiBrain Consortium, San Diego, CA 92037 USA; [Thom, Nathaniel J.] Sci Applicat Int Corp, Mclean, VA 22102 USA; [Johnson, Douglas C.; Flagan, Taru; Simmons, Alan N.; Kotturi, Sante A.; Swain, Judith L.; Paulus, Martin P.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychiat, San Diego, CA 92037 USA; [Potterat, Eric G.] Naval Special Warfare Grp One, San Diego, CA 92118 USA; [Swain, Judith L.] Singapore Inst Clin Sci A STAR, Singapore, Singapore; [Swain, Judith L.] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore 117548, Singapore","Thom, NJ (reprint author), Univ Calif San Diego, 8939 Villa La Jolla Dr Suite 200, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.","nate.thom@med.navy.mil","","Paulus, Martin/0000-0002-0825-3606","","","","56","5","5","1","19","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

Eleven Catholics and 13 Atheists (all female) judged 48 moral dilemmas. Differential neural activity between the two groups was found in precuneus and in prefrontal, frontal and temporal regions. Furthermore, a double dissociation showed that Catholics recruited different areas for deontological (precuneus; temporoparietal junction) and utilitarian moral judgments [dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC); temporal poles], whereas Atheists did not (superior parietal gyrus for both types of judgment). Finally, we tested how both groups responded to personal and impersonal moral dilemmas: Catholics showed enhanced activity in DLPFC and posterior cingulate cortex during utilitarian moral judgments to impersonal moral dilemmas and enhanced responses in anterior cingulate cortex and superior temporal sulcus during deontological moral judgments to personal moral dilemmas. Our results indicate that moral judgment can be influenced by an acquired set of norms and conventions transmitted through religious indoctrination and practice.

In this study, the biological roots for the proselfs/prosocials concept are explored by investigating the neural correlates of cooperative versus defect decisions when participants engage in a series of one-shot, anonymous prisoner's dilemma situations. Our data are in line with previous studies showing that prosocials activate several social cognition regions of the brain more than proselfs (here: medial prefrontal cortex, temporo-parietal junction, and precuneus BA 7 (Brodmann area 7), and that dispositional trust positively affects prosocials' decisions to cooperate. At the neural level, however, dispositional trust appears to exert a greater marginal effect on brain activity of proselfs in three social cognition regions, which does not translate into an increase in cooperation. An event-related analysis shows that cooperating prosocials show significantly more activation in the precuneus (BA 7) than proselfs. Based on previous research, we interpret this result to be consistent with prosocials' enhanced tendency to infer the intentions of others in social dilemma games, and the importance of establishing norm congruence when they decide to cooperate.","[Emonds, Griet; Declerck, Carolyn H.; Boone, Christophe] Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Seurinck, Ruth] Univ Ghent, Fac Psychol Sci, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Achten, Rik] Univ Ghent, Fac Med, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","Emonds, G (reprint author), Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.","Griet.Emonds@ua.ac.be","Declerck, Carolyn/A-1508-2016; Boone, Christophe/K-4945-2015","","","","","58","14","16","2","56","PSYCHOLOGY PRESS","HOVE","27 CHURCH RD, HOVE BN3 2FA, EAST SUSSEX, ENGLAND","1747-0919","1747-0927","","SOC NEUROSCI-UK","Soc.

To examine the neural basis of perceiving family-related in-group boundaries in response to written kinship scenarios, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging in 27 healthy adults and obtained self-report ratings of family-related entitativity, which measures to what degree participants perceive their family as a coherent and distinct group in society. We expected that activity in the subgenual cingulate cortex and septo-hypothalamic region would track individual differences in entitativity. Perceiving one's family as a distinct and cohesive group (high entitativity) was associated with increased subgenual cortex response to kinship scenarios. The subgenual cingulate cortex may represent a key link between kin-related emotional attachment and group perception, providing a neurobiological basis for group belongingness.","[Ruesch, Nicolas] Univ Ulm, Dept Psychiat 2, D-89069 Ulm, Germany; [Bado, Patricia; Zahn, Roland; Bramati, Ivanei E.; de Oliveira-Souza, Ricardo; Moll, Jorge] DOr Inst Res & Educ IDOR, Cognit & Behav Neurosci Unit, BR-22281100 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Bado, Patricia; Bramati, Ivanei E.; Moll, Jorge] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, ICB, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Zahn, Roland] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat, Dept Psychol Med, London WC2R 2LS, England; [de Oliveira-Souza, Ricardo] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Gaffree & Guinle Univ Hosp, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Moll, J (reprint author), DOr Inst Res & Educ IDOR, Cognit & Behav Neurosci Unit, Rua Diniz Cordeiro 30,3 Andar, BR-22281100 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.","jorge.moll@idor.org","Zahn, Roland/C-4665-2008","Zahn, Roland/0000-0002-8447-1453","D'Or Institute for Research Education; FAPERJ; CNPq, Brazil; MRC [G0902304]; Medical Research Council [G0902304]","JM was supported by intramural resources from the D'Or Institute for Research & Education, and by grants from FAPERJ and CNPq, Brazil.

We found that judgments of self vs a public figure elicited greater activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in Danish than in Chinese participants regardless of attribute dimensions for judgments. However, self-judgments of social attributes induced greater activity in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) in Chinese than in Danish participants. Moreover, the group difference in TPJ activity was mediated by a measure of a cultural value (i.e. interdependence of self-construal).

Two well-investigated emotion-regulation strategies (ERSs), cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, are associated with overlapping prefrontal neural correlates, but differ temporally during the emotion-generation process. Although functional imaging studies have mainly investigated these ERS as a reaction to an emotion-inducing event, the intention to regulate upcoming negative emotions might already be associated with differences in neural activity. Hence, event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging was recorded in 42 participants while they completed an emotion-regulation paradigm. During this task, participants were instructed to proactively prepare to use a specific ERS knowing that a negative, high-arousing image would appear after the preparation period. As expected, the results demonstrated prefrontal and parietal activation while participants were suppressing or reappraising their emotions (family-wise error (FWE)-corrected). The intention to suppress emotions was associated with increased activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral putamen, pre-supplementary motor area and right supramarginal gyrus (FWE-corrected). This enhanced proactive inhibitory control: (i) predicted decreased motoric activity during the actual suppression of emotional expressions and (2) trended toward a significant association with how successfully participants suppressed their emotions. However, neural correlates of preparatory control for cognitive reappraisal were not observed, possibly because contextual cues about the upcoming emotional stimulus are necessary to proactively start to cognitively reinterpret the situation.","[Vanderhasselt, Marie-Anne; Kuehn, Simone; De Raedt, Rudi] Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Clin & Hlth Psychol, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Kuehn, Simone] Charite, Clin Psychiat & Psychotherapy, D-13353 Berlin, Germany","Vanderhasselt, MA (reprint author), Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Clin & Hlth Psychol, Henri Dunantlaan 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.","MarieAnne.Vanderhasselt@Ugent.be","De Raedt, Rudi/A-3269-2012; Kuhn, Simone/P-6145-2014","De Raedt, Rudi/0000-0001-6781-4808; "," [FWO08/PDO/168];  [BOF10/GOA/014]","M.A.V.

However, the malleability of these affective responses remains largely unexplored. The perceived controllability of a stigma (whether or not the bearer of the stigma is perceived as being responsible for his or her condition) has been found to polarize behavioral affective responses to that stigma. The current study uses functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify the neural correlates underlying the evaluation of stigmatized individuals (people who are homeless) when perceptions of the controllability of their condition are altered. Results demonstrated that perceivers engaged neural networks implicated in inferring intentionality (e.g. the medial prefrontal cortex) when they evaluated a homeless individual who was described as being responsible for becoming homeless. Conversely, neural networks associated with resolving strong affective responses (e.g. insula) were engaged when evaluating a homeless individual who was described as not being responsible for becoming homeless.","[Krendl, Anne C.] Tufts Univ, Dept Psychol, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Moran, Joseph M.] Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Ambady, Nalini] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Krendl, AC (reprint author), Tufts Univ, 490 Boston Ave, Medford, MA 02155 USA.","anne.krendl@tufts.edu","","","NSF [BCS-0435547]; Ruth Kirschstein National Research Service Award from the National Institute Aging [1F32AG034039]","We would like to thank Jasmin Cloutier for input on the study design, and Tammy Moran, Rebecca Mohr and Cynthia Ko for assistance with data collection.

However, the neural activity associated with the self-construal priming procedure itself remains unknown. It is also unclear whether and how self-construal priming affects neural activity prior to engaging in a particular task. To address this gap, we scanned Chinese adults, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, during self-construal priming and a following resting state. We found that, relative to a calculation task, both interdependent and independent self-construal priming activated the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). The contrast of interdependent vs. independent self-construal priming also revealed increased activity in the dorsal MPFC and left middle frontal cortex. The regional homogeneity analysis of the resting-state activity revealed increased local synchronization of spontaneous activity in the dorsal MPFC but decreased local synchronization of spontaneous activity in the PCC when contrasting interdependent vs. independent self-construal priming. The functional connectivity analysis of the resting-state activity, however, did not show significant difference in synchronization of activities in remote brain regions between different priming conditions.

These shared representations have been assumed to provide indirect evidence for a human mirror neuron system, which is suggested to be a prerequisite of action comprehension. We aimed at clarifying whether shared representations in and beyond human mirror areas are specifically activated by affective facial expressions or whether they are activated by facial expressions independent of the emotional meaning. During neuroimaging, participants observed and executed happy and non-emotional facial expressions. Shared representations were revealed for happy facial expressions in the pars opercularis, the precentral gyrus, in the superior temporal gyrus/medial temporal gyrus (MTG), in the pre-supplementary motor area and in the right amygdala. All areas showed less pronounced activation in the non-emotional condition. When directly compared, significant stronger neural responses emerged for happy facial expressions in the pre-supplementary motor area and in the MTG than for non-emotional stimuli. We assume that activation of shared representations depends on the affect and (social) relevance of the facial expression. The pre-supplementary motor area is a core-shared representation-structure supporting observation and execution of affective contagious facial expressions and might have a modulatory role during the preparation of executing happy facial expressions.","[Kircher, Tilo] Univ Marburg, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Marburg, Germany; [Pohl, Anna; Thimm, Markus; Mathiak, Klaus] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Pohl, Anna; Thimm, Markus; Schulte-Ruether, Martin; Mathiak, Klaus] Univ Marburg, JARA Translat Brain Med, Marburg, Germany; [Krach, Soeren] Univ Marburg, Dept Neurol, Marburg, Germany; [Schulte-Ruether, Martin] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Child Neuropsychol Sect, Dept Child & Adolescent Psychiat, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Schulte-Ruether, Martin] Res Ctr Julich, Cognit Neurol Sect INM 3, Inst Neurosci & Med, Julich, Germany; [Anders, Silke] Med Univ Lubeck, Neuroimage Nord, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany; [Anders, Silke] Med Univ Lubeck, Dept Neurol, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany; [Mathiak, Klaus] Res Ctr Julich, Struct & Funct Org Brain INM 1, Inst Neurosci & Med, Julich, Germany","Pohl, A (reprint author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Pauwelsstr 30, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.","anpohl@ukaachen.de","Schulte-Ruther, Martin/F-4784-2013","Schulte-Ruther, Martin/0000-0002-7198-9923; Kircher, Tilo/0000-0002-2514-2625","Federal Ministry of Education and Research [BMBF] [FKZ 01GW0751]; Interdisciplinary Centre for Clinical Research of the Medical Faculty of the RWTH Aachen University [IZKF] [N2, N4-2]","We thank Simon Eickhoff and Thilo Kellermann for their kind and knowledgeable assistance in methodologies and statistics.

To address this question, we had participant's complete functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while observing a friend and stranger experience social exclusion. Observing a friend's exclusion activated affective pain regions associated with the direct (i.e. firsthand) experience of exclusion [dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and insula], and this activation correlated with self-reported self-other overlap with the friend. Alternatively, observing a stranger's exclusion activated regions associated with thinking about the traits, mental states and intentions of others ['mentalizing'; dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), precuneus, and temporal pole]. Comparing activation from observing friend's vs stranger's exclusion showed increased activation in brain regions associated with the firsthand experience of exclusion (dACC and anterior insula) and with thinking about the self [medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC)]. Finally, functional connectivity analyses demonstrated that MPFC and affective pain regions activated in concert during empathy for friends, but not strangers.

However, there are unresolved questions regarding the cognitive mechanisms underlying people's responses to social exclusion. Here, we sought to gain insight into these behavioral tendencies by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the impact of social exclusion on neural responses to visual scenes that varied on dimensions of sociality and emotional valence. Compared to socially included participants, socially excluded participants failed to recruit dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), a brain region involved in mentalizing, for negative social scenes. Moreover, following social exclusion, dmPFC demonstrated a linear effect of valence, with greater activity to positive social scenes compared to negative social scenes. These results suggest that, following social exclusion, people display a preference for mentalizing about positive social information and tend to avoid negative aspects of their social world.","[Powers, Katherine E.; Wagner, Dylan D.; Norris, Catherine J.; Heatherton, Todd F.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA","Powers, KE (reprint author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, 6207 Moore Hall, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.","katherine.e.powers@dartmouth.edu","Wagner, Dylan/B-1069-2015","Wagner, Dylan/0000-0002-1062-8163","National Institute of Mental Health [R01MH059282]","We would like to thank Terry Sackett and Sophie Palitz for assistance with data collection.

This study thus emphasizes that distinct emotions have distinct effects on people in terms of behavior and underlying neurological mechanisms.","[Lelieveld, Gert-Jan; Van Dijk, Eric; Guroglu, Berna; Rombouts, Serge A.

We investigated whether WT is grounded on low-level selective attention or on higher level cognitive processes including differential weighting of evidence or response formation. Participants in our MRI study predicted the likelihood that their favorite or least favorite team would win a football game. Consistent with expectations, favorite team trials were characterized by higher winning odds. Our data demonstrated activity in a cluster comprising parts of the left inferior occipital and fusiform gyri to distinguish between favorite and least favorite team trials. More importantly, functional connectivities of this cluster with the human reward system were specifically involved in the type of WT investigated in our study, thus supporting the idea of an attention bias generating WT. Prefrontal cortex activity also distinguished between the two teams. However, activity in this region and its functional connectivities with the human reward system were altogether unrelated to the degree of WT reflected in the participants' behavior and may rather be related to social identification, ensuring the affective context necessary for WT to arise.","[Aue, Tatjana] Univ Geneva, Swiss Ctr Affect Sci, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland; [Nusbaum, Howard C.; Cacioppo, John T.] Univ Chicago, Ctr Cognit & Social Neurosci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Aue, T (reprint author), Univ Geneva, Swiss Ctr Affect Sci, 7 Rue Battoirs, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland.","tatjana.aue@unige.ch","","","National Institute of Mental Health [P50 MH72850]; John Templeton Foundation","This research was supported by National Institute of Mental Health Grant No. P50 MH72850 and the John Templeton Foundation.","","33","5","5","0","12","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

Examining how neural regions involved in arousal, inhibition and control covary when negative stereotypes are activated can provide insight into whether individuals attempt to downregulate biases. Using fMRI, White egalitarian-motivated participants were shown Black and White faces at fast (32 ms) or slow (525 ms) presentation speeds. To create a racially negative stereotypic context, participants listened to violent and misogynistic rap (VMR) in the background. No music (NM) and death metal (DM) were used as control conditions in separate blocks. Fast exposure of Black faces elicited amygdala activation in the NM and VMR conditions (but not DM), that also negatively covaried with activation in prefrontal regions. Only in VMR, however, did amygdala activation for Black faces persist during slow exposure and positively covary with activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex while negatively covarying with activation in orbitofrontal cortex. Findings suggest that contexts that prime negative racial stereotypes seem to hinder the downregulation of amygdala activation that typically occurs when egalitarian perceivers are exposed to Black faces.","[Forbes, Chad E.; Cox, Christine L.; Ryan, Lee] Univ Arizona, Dept Psychol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Schmader, Toni] Univ British Columbia, Dept Psychol, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Forbes, CE (reprint author), Univ Delaware, Dept Psychol, 222 Wolf Hall, Newark, DE 19716 USA.","cforbes@psych.udel.edu","","","Arizona Department of Health Services; Cognition and Neuroimaging Laboratories at the University of Arizona [HB2354]","The authors would like to thank Cindy Woolverton, Shawn Marks, and Tanya Nemec for their assistance with data analysis, and all participants for their time, cooperation, and ability to resist head banging while in the scanner.

Although previous research has examined neural systems related to value and choice, very little is known about how mindset influences these systems. In the current study, participants were primed with Health or Taste while they made decisions about snack foods. Some neural regions showed consistent associations with value and choice across Health or Taste mindsets. Regardless of mindset, medial orbitofrontal cortex (MOFC) tracked value in terms of taste, regions in left lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) tracked value in terms of health, and MOFC and dorsal anterior cingulate were associated with choice. However, activity in other neural regions was modulated by the mindset manipulation. When primed with Taste, rostral anterior cingulate tracked value in terms of taste whereas left amygdala and left putamen were associated with choice. When primed with Health, right LPFC and posterior MOFC tracked value in terms of health. The findings contribute to the neural research on decision-making by demonstrating that changing perspectives can modulate value- and choice-related neural activity.","[Bhanji, Jamil P.; Beer, Jennifer S.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Psychol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Bhanji, JP (reprint author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Psychol, 1 Univ Stn,A8000, Austin, TX 78712 USA.","bhanji@mail.utexas.edu","","Bhanji, Jamil/0000-0003-3451-8732","NIMH [T32 MH2006-10]","This research was supported by an NIMH Predoctoral Training Fellowship in Affective Science to Jamil Palacios Bhanji, grant T32 MH2006-10.","","45","12","12","1","17","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

Functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI) were acquired as participants viewed 55 s continuous sequences of slides to induce either compassion or pride, presented in alternation with sequences of neutral slides. Emotion self-report data were collected after each slide condition within the fMRI scanner. Compassion induction was associated with activation in the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG), a region that is activated during pain and the perception of others' pain, and that has been implicated in parental nurturance behaviors. Pride induction engaged the posterior medial cortex, a region that has been associated with self-referent processing. Self-reports of compassion experience were correlated with increased activation in a region near the PAG, and in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Self-reports of pride experience, in contrast, were correlated with reduced activation in the IFG and the anterior insula. These results provide preliminary evidence towards understanding the neural correlates of important interpersonal dimensions of compassion and pride.

At the neural level, these models propose that each region along the visual processing hierarchy entails one set of processing units encoding predictions of bottom-up input, and another set computing mismatches (prediction error or surprise) between predictions and evidence. This contrasts with traditional views of visual neurons operating purely as bottom-up feature detectors. In support of the predictive coding hypothesis, a recent human neuroimaging study (Egner, Monti, & Summerfield, 2010) showed that neural population responses to expected and unexpected face and house stimuli in the ""fusiform face area"" (FFA) could be well-described as a summation of hypothetical face-expectation and -surprise signals, but not by feature detector responses. Here, we used computer simulations to test whether these imaging data could be formally explained within the broader framework of a mathematical neural network model of associative learning (Schmajuk, Gray, & Lam, 1996). Results show that FFA responses could be fit very closely by model variables coding for conditional predictions (and their violations) of stimuli that unconditionally activate the FFA. These data document that neural population signals in the ventral visual stream that deviate from classic feature detection responses can formally be explained by associative prediction and surprise signals.","[Jiang, Jiefeng; Egner, Tobias] Duke Univ, Ctr Cognit Neurosci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Jiang, Jiefeng; Schmajuk, Nestor; Egner, Tobias] Duke Univ, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Egner, T (reprint author), Duke Univ, Ctr Cognit Neurosci, LSRC Box 90999, Durham, NC 27708 USA.","tobias.egner@duke.edu","Egner, Tobias/A-5237-2009","Egner, Tobias/0000-0001-7956-3241","","","","35","7","7","2","6","AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","WASHINGTON","750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","0735-7044","","","BEHAV NEUROSCI","Behav.

In both tasks, participants activated areas associated with visual representation of the body, motion processing and emotion recognition. Behaviorally, participants demonstrated greater ease in judging the physical actions of the characters compared to judging their emotional states, and participants showed more activation in areas associated with emotion processing in the emotion detection task, whereas they showed more activation in visual, spatial and action-related areas in the physical action task. Gender differences emerged in brain responses, such that men showed greater activation than women in the left dorsal premotor cortex in both tasks.

To further address its role, we investigated the response of the amygdala to human and cat faces with varied pupil size, taking into account the effect of the gender and subjective attractiveness ratings. Twenty-seven subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while viewing faces with large and small pupils. Large pupil faces induced increased activation in the amygdala, without interactions with either subject or stimuli gender, although no equivalent activation differences were seen for cat face stimuli. The activation differences were irrespective of the perceived attractiveness, and without explicit knowledge about the manipulation of the pupil size. These data support the idea that the amygdala is responsive not only to explicit or implicit fear, abhorrence or preference, but also to other elements that might suggest heightened vigilance of biologically relevant stimuli, which does not necessarily require subjective awareness.","[Amemiya, Shiori; Ohtomo, Kuni] Univ Tokyo, Dept Radiol, Grad Sch Med, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138655, Japan","Amemiya, S (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Radiol, Grad Sch Med, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138655, Japan.","amemiya-tky@umin.ac.jp","","Amemiya, Shiori/0000-0002-2132-1642","","","","45","9","10","0","15","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

We investigated how neural mechanisms underlying social evaluation are engaged with age, and how age-related changes to socioemotional goals affect recruitment of regions within this network. In a functional MRI study, 15 young and 15 older adults formed behavior-based impressions of individuals. They also responded to a prompt that was interpersonally meaningful, social but interpersonally irrelevant, or non-social. Both age groups engaged regions implicated in mentalizing and impression formation when making social relative to non-social evaluations, including dorsal and ventral medial prefrontal cortices, precuneus, and temporoparietal junction. Older adults had increased activation over young in right temporal pole when making social relative to non-social evaluations, suggesting reliance on past experiences when evaluating others. Young adults had greater activation than old in posterior cingulate gyrus when making interpersonally irrelevant, compared to interpersonally meaningful, evaluations, potentially reflecting enhanced valuation of this information. The findings demonstrate the age-related preservation of the neural correlates underlying social evaluation, and suggest that functioning in these regions might be mediated by age-related changes in socioemotional goals.","[Cassidy, Brittany S.; Shih, Joanne Y.; Gutchess, Angela H.] Brandeis Univ, Waltham, MA 02454 USA","Cassidy, BS (reprint author), Brandeis Univ, MS 062, Waltham, MA 02454 USA.","bcassidy@brandeis.edu","","","National Institute on Aging [R21 AG032382]; NIH [T32-GM084907-01]; NSF; National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), National Institutes of Health","We thank Leslie Zebrowitz for helpful comments, and Avi Aizenman and Michael Margolis for research assistance.

To explore the differential role of the TPJ and mPFC, participants read several verbal descriptions about an agent. Embedded in a factorial design, in one-half of the trials (behavior condition), the agent was engaged in a simple goal-directed behavior, whereas in the other half this description was absent. In another half of the trials (trait condition), the participants had to answer a question about a trait of the agent, whereas in the other half the question was about the agent's physical appearance. The results revealed that the dorsal mPFC was recruited when participants inferred the agent's trait, irrespective of a behavioral description. In contrast, the TPJ, posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), anterior intraparietal sulcus, and premotor cortex were activated when goal-directed behavioral information was presented, irrespective of a trait question.

This typically first-person view of one's own action subsequently transfers to the third-person view when observing another individual. We tested vision-action associations and the transfer from first-person to third-person perspective by comparing novel hand-action sequences that were learned under three conditions: first, by being performed and simultaneously viewed from a first-person perspective; second, by being performed but not seen; and third, by being seen from a first-person view without being executed. We then used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare the response to these three types of learned action sequences when they were presented from a third-person perspective. Visuomotor areas responded most strongly to sequences that were learned by simultaneously producing and observing the action sequences. We also note an important asymmetry between vision and action: Action sequences learned by performance alone, in the absence of vision, facilitated the emergence of visuomotor responses, whereas action sequences learned by viewing alone had comparably little effect. This dominance of action over vision supports the notion of forward/predictive models of visuomotor systems.","[Wiggett, Alison J.; Tipper, Steven P.; Downing, Paul E.] Bangor Univ, Sch Psychol, Bangor LL57 2AS, Gwynedd, Wales; [Hudson, Matthew] Univ Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; [Clifford, Angela] Univ Loughborough, Sch Sport Exercise & Hlth Sci, Loughborough, Leics, England","Wiggett, AJ (reprint author), Bangor Univ, Sch Psychol, Bangor LL57 2AS, Gwynedd, Wales.","a.wiggett@bangor.ac.uk","Tipper, Steven/I-6884-2012; Hudson, Matthew/O-8356-2015","Tipper, Steven/0000-0002-1554-0531; Hudson, Matthew/0000-0003-1027-2846; Tipper, Steven Paul/0000-0002-7066-1117; Clifford, Angela/0000-0003-0046-3331; Downing, Paul/0000-0002-5046-2858","ESRC [RES-062-23-0980]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F028652/1]","We thank P.

Based on developmental and psychological research, it has been hypothesized that avoidant attachment style (AV) entails deactivating strategies in social contexts, whereas anxious attachment style (AX) involves hyper vigilance and up-regulation mechanisms. However, the neural substrates of differences in social emotion regulation associated with AAS have not been systematically investigated. Here we used fMRI in 19 healthy adults to investigate the effect of AAS on the processing of pleasant or unpleasant social and nonsocial scenes. Participants were asked either to naturally attend (NAT), cognitively reappraise (REAP), or behaviorally suppress (ESUP) their emotional responses. Avoidantly attached participants showed increased prefrontal and anterior cingulate activation to social negative scenes when making spontaneous emotion judgments. They also exhibited persistent increases in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left amygdala activity for the same stimuli during reappraisal, as well as additional activation in supplementary motor area and ventral caudate during the suppression of social positive emotions. These results suggest that AV may imply less efficient reappraisal strategies to regulate social negative emotions, and lead to higher conflict or effortful control when suppression cannot be employed. In contrast, anxiously attached participants showed differential increases in the right amygdala and left parahippocampal cortex for social negative and positive stimuli, respectively, but only when making spontaneous emotion judgments. No effect of AX was found during down-regulation conditions. This suggests heightened arousal to negative information without difficulty in down-regulating emotions through cognitive re-evaluation or suppression. Taken together, these findings reveal for the first time the neural underpinnings of attachment-related differences in social emotion regulation.","[Vrticka, Pascal; Sander, David; Vuilleumier, Patrik] Univ Geneva, Swiss Ctr Affect Sci, Geneva, Switzerland; [Vrticka, Pascal; Vuilleumier, Patrik] Univ Geneva, Lab Neurol & Imaging Cognit, Dept Neurol, Geneva, Switzerland; [Vrticka, Pascal; Vuilleumier, Patrik] Univ Geneva, Dept Neurosci, Univ Hosp, Geneva, Switzerland; [Vrticka, Pascal; Vuilleumier, Patrik] Univ Geneva, Sch Med, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Bondolfi, Guido] Univ Hosp Geneva, Dept Psychiat, Geneva, Switzerland; [Vrticka, Pascal; Sander, David] Univ Geneva, Lab Study Emot Elicitat & Express Lab E3, Dept Psychol, FPSE, Geneva, Switzerland","Vrticka, P (reprint author), Swiss Natl Ctr Affect Sci, 7 Rue Battoirs, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland.","pascal.vrticka@unige.ch","Vrticka, Pascal/H-2209-2013; Vrticka, Pascal/U-9166-2018","Vrticka, Pascal/0000-0002-4806-9037; Vrticka, Pascal/0000-0002-8920-5509","National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) Affective Sciences; Swiss National Science Foundation [51NF40-104897]","This research was supported by the National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) Affective Sciences financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation (no. 51NF40-104897) and hosted by the University of Geneva, plus grants of the Swiss National Science Foundation to D.

Consequently, the PD poses greater conflict between self-and collective interest, greater demands for computational reasoning to derive the optimal solution, and greater demands for mentalizing to infer the intentions of others. Consistent with these differences between the two games, the results indicate that the PD is associated with increased activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus, prefrontal cortex, parietal lobe, and temporoparietal junction. With less conflict, the demands for computation and mentalizing are reduced in the SH, and cooperation levels increase dramatically. The differences in brain activation elicited by the different incentive structures of the PD and the SH appear to be independent of individual differences in revealed social preferences.","[Emonds, Griet; Declerck, Carolyn H.; Boone, Christophe] Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Vandervliet, Everhard J.

To investigate the neural bases of such adaptive mechanisms, we examined how individuals adjust their actions after decision-conflicts observed in others compared to self-experienced conflicts. Participants responded to the color of a stimulus, while its spatial position elicited either a conflicting or a congruent action. Participants were required either to respond to stimuli themselves or to observe the response of another participant. We studied the difference between interference effects following conflicting or congruent stimuli, an effect known as conflict adaptation. Consistent with earlier reports, we found that the implementation of reactive control, following congruent trials, was accompanied by activation of the right inferior frontal cortex. Individual differences in the efficacy of response inhibition covaried with the level of activation in that region. Sustaining proactive control, following incongruent trials, activated the left lateral prefrontal cortex. Most importantly, adaptive controls induced by decision-conflicts observed in others, as well as the associated prefrontal activations, were comparable to those induced by self-experienced conflicts. We show that in both behavioral and neural terms we adapt to conflicts happening to others just as if they happened to us.","[Winkel, Jasper; Ridderinkhof, K.

Although investigations into the interactions between these forces have begun to shed light on the neural correlates of affective processing during the transition to adolescence, relatively little is known about the relationship between pubertal development and emotion perception at the neural level. In the current longitudinal study, 45 neurotypical participants were shown affective facial displays while undergoing fMRI, at ages 10 and 13. Neural responses to emotional expressions at both time points were then correlated with a self-report measure of pubertal development, revealing positive associations with activity in amygdala, thalamus and visual cortical areas at age 10 that increased in magnitude and extent by age 13. At the latter time point, pubertal development was additionally correlated with enhanced responses to faces in temporal pole, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and dorsomedial PFC. Longitudinal comparisons revealed that the relationships between pubertal development and activity in the amygdala, hippocampus and temporal pole were significantly stronger during early adolescence than late childhood. These results suggest that pubertal development per se is linked to neural processing of socioemotional stimuli, particularly with respect to the integration of complex perceptual input and higher order cortical processing of affective content.","[Masten, Carrie L.] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Mazziotta, John C.; Iacoboni, Marco; Dapretto, Mirella] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Ahmanson Lovelace Brain Mapping Ctr, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Iacoboni, Marco; Dapretto, Mirella] Univ Calif Los Angeles, FPR, Ctr Culture Brain & Dev, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Moore, William E., III; Pfeifer, Jennifer H.] Univ Oregon, Dept Psychol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA","Pfeifer, JH (reprint author), 1227 Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.","jpfeifer@uoregon.edu","","Moore, Will/0000-0002-7012-7803","National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) [RR12169, RR13642, RR00865]","The authors wish to express their gratitude to Kristin McNealy, Larissa Borofsky, Nicole Vazquez, Elliot Berkman, Junaid Merchant and the University of Oregon Developmental Social Neuroscience and Social Affective Neuroscience Labs.

However, little is known about the mechanisms through which friendships may serve their protective role at this age, or the potential benefit of these friendships as adolescents transition to adulthood. As such, this investigation tested whether friend involvement during adolescence related to less neural sensitivity to social threats during young adulthood. Twenty-one adolescents reported the amount of time they spent with friends outside of school using a daily diary. Two years later they underwent an fMRI scan, during which they were ostensibly excluded from an online ball-tossing game by two same-age peers. Findings from region of interest and whole brain analyses revealed that spending more time with friends during adolescence related to less activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula-regions previously linked with negative affect and pain processing-during an experience of peer rejection 2 years later. These findings are consistent with the notion that positive relationships during adolescence may relate to individuals being less sensitive to negative social experiences later on.","[Masten, Carrie L.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Mind & Brain, Davis, CA 95618 USA; [Telzer, Eva H.; Fuligni, Andrew J.; Lieberman, Matthew D.; Eisenberger, Naomi I.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Fuligni, Andrew J.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychiat & Biobehav Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA","Masten, CL (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Mind & Brain, 267 Cousteau Pl, Davis, CA 95618 USA.","clmasten@ucdavis.edu","","","Russell Sage Foundation; Cousins Center for Psychoneuroimmunology, Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior, University of California, Los Angeles, USA","The authors wish to thank the Ahmanson-Lovelace Brain Mapping Center.

Individuals vary in the extent to which these skills are developed, with the term 'alexithymia' often applied in the clinical and personality literature to those individuals most compromised in these skills. Although a frontal lobe model of alexithymia is emerging, it is unclear whether such a model satisfactorily reflects brain-related patterns associated with perceived emotional intelligence at the facet level. To determine whether these trait meta-mood facets (ability to attend to, have clarity of and repair emotions) have unique gray matter volume correlates, a voxel-based morphometry study was conducted in 30 healthy adults using the Trait Meta Mood Scale while co-varying for potentially confounding sociodemographic variables. Poorer Attention to Emotion was associated with lower gray matter volume in clusters distributed primarily throughout the frontal lobe, with peak correlation in the left medial frontal gyrus. Poorer Mood Repair was related to lower gray matter volume in three clusters in frontal and inferior parietal areas, with peak correlation in the left anterior cingulate. No significant volumetric correlations emerged for the Clarity of Emotion facet. We discuss the localization of these areas in the context of cortical circuits known to be involved in processes of self-reflection and cognitive control.","[Koven, Nancy S.] Bates Coll, Program Neurosci, Dept Psychol, Lewiston, ME 04240 USA; [Roth, Robert M.; Garlinghouse, Matthew A.; Flashman, Laura A.] DHMC, Dartmouth Med Sch, Dept Psychiat, Brain Imaging Lab, Lebanon, NH 03756 USA; [Roth, Robert M.; Flashman, Laura A.] New Hampshire Hosp, Concord, NH 03301 USA; [Saykin, Andrew J.] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Dept Radiol, Ctr Neuroimaging, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA","Koven, NS (reprint author), Bates Coll, Program Neurosci, Dept Psychol, 4 Andrews Rd, Lewiston, ME 04240 USA.","nkoven@bates.edu","Saykin, Andrew/A-1318-2007","Saykin, Andrew/0000-0002-1376-8532; Koven, Nancy/0000-0002-5904-9373","National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NIH) [U54 EB005149]; Stanley Medical Foundation; National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression; Hitchcock Foundation; New Hampshire Hospital","This work was supported by grants from National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NIH U54 EB005149 to R.M.R., L.A.F. and A.J.S.); Stanley Medical Foundation (to L.A.F.); National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression (to R.M.R.); Hitchcock Foundation (to R.M.R.) and the New Hampshire Hospital (to L.A.F. and A.J.S.).","","78","23","24","2","16","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

We borrowed a phenomenon from film theory which states that presentation of an as such neutral visual scene intensifies the percept of fear or suspense induced by a different channel of information, such as language. Our main aim was to investigate how neutral visual scenes can enhance responses to fearful language content in parts of the brain involved in the perception of emotion. Healthy participants' brain activity was measured (using functional magnetic resonance imaging) while they read fearful and less fearful sentences presented with or without a neutral visual scene. The main idea is that the visual scenes intensify the fearful content of the language by subtly implying and concretizing what is described in the sentence. Activation levels in the right anterior temporal pole were selectively increased when a neutral visual scene was paired with a fearful sentence, compared to reading the sentence alone, as well as to reading of non-fearful sentences presented with the same neutral scene. We conclude that the right anterior temporal pole serves a binding function of emotional information across domains such as visual and linguistic information.","[Willems, Roel M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Willems, Roel M.; Hagoort, Peter] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Clevis, Krien] Leiden Univ, Humanities Fac, NL-2311 EX Leiden, Netherlands; [Clevis, Krien] Leuven Univ, IVOK, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Hagoort, Peter] Max Planck Inst Psycholinguist, NL-6525 XD Nijmegen, Netherlands","Willems, RM (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, 132 Barker Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.","roelwillems@berkeley.edu","Hagoort, Peter/B-7417-2012; Willems, Roel/E-3703-2012","","Netherlands Organisation for scientific research (NWO) [NWO 446-08-008]; Niels Stensen foundation","Supported by The Netherlands Organisation for scientific research (NWO) through a grant in the CO-OPs 'Inter-territorial explorations in art and science' program as well as by a 'Rubicon' grant (NWO 446-08-008) and by the Niels Stensen foundation.

The present study evaluated whether emotional faces engage sustained neural processing by examining the attenuation of neural repetition suppression to repeated emotional faces. Repetition suppression of neural function refers to the general reduction of neural activity when processing a repeated stimulus. Preferential processing of emotional face stimuli, however, should elicit sustained neural processing such that repetition suppression to repeated emotional faces is attenuated relative to faces with no emotional content. We measured the reduction of functional magnetic resonance imaging signals associated with immediate repetition of neutral, angry and happy faces. Whereas neutral faces elicited the greatest suppression in ventral visual cortex, followed by angry faces, repetition suppression was the most attenuated for happy faces. Indeed, happy faces showed almost no repetition suppression in part of the right-inferior occipital and fusiform gyri, which play an important role in face-identity processing. Our findings suggest that happy faces are associated with sustained visual encoding of face identity and thereby assist in the formation of more elaborate representations of the faces, congruent with findings in the behavioral literature.","[Suzuki, Atsunobu] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Goh, Joshua O.

However, in everyday live, emotional expressions are changing rapidly, and the processing of the onset vs the offset of the very same emotional expression might rely on different brain networks, presumably leading to different behavioral and physiological reactions (e.g. approach or avoidance). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, this was examined by presenting video clips depicting onsets and offsets of happy and angry facial expressions. Subjective valence and threat ratings clearly depended on the direction of change. Blood oxygen level dependent responses indicate both reward- and threat-related activations for the offset of angry expressions. Comparing onsets and offsets, angry offsets were associated with stronger ventral striatum activation than angry onsets. Additionally, the offset of happy and the onset of angry expressions showed strong common activity in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex bilaterally, the left amygdala and the left insula, whereas the onset of happy and the offset of angry expressions induced significant activation in the left dorsal striatum. In sum, the results confirm different activity in motivation-related brain areas in response to the onset and offset of the same emotional expression and highlight the importance of temporal characteristics of facial expressions for social communication.","[Muehlberger, Andreas; Wieser, Matthias J.; Gerdes, Antje B.

In the current study, participants were presented with either happy or sad faces, while expressing one of these emotions themselves. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure neural responses on trials where the observed emotion was either congruent or incongruent with the expressed emotion. Our results indicate that being in a congruent emotional state, irrespective of the emotion, activates the medial orbitofrontal cortex and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, brain areas that have been associated with positive feelings and reward processing.

In Study 1, neuroimaging analyses revealed that individuals whose mesolimbic activation correlated with the expected value estimates of a rational actor made more optimal financial decisions. In Study 2, presentation of expected value information improved decision making in both younger and older adults, but the addition of a distracting secondary task had little impact on decision quality. Remarkably, provision of expected value information improved the performance of older adults to match that of younger adults at baseline. These findings are consistent with the notion that mesolimbic circuits play a critical role in optimal choice, and imply that providing simplified information about expected value may improve financial risk taking across the adult life span.","[Samanez-Larkin, Gregory R.; Wagner, Anthony D.; Knutson, Brian] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Samanez-Larkin, GR (reprint author), Jordan Hall,Bldg 420,450 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.","glarkin@stanford.edu","Samanez-Larkin, Gregory/A-1139-2007","Samanez-Larkin, Gregory/0000-0001-7846-3804; Knutson, Brian/0000-0002-7669-426X","Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Investor Education Foundation; US National Institute on Aging [AG030778, AG024957, AG017253]; National Institute of Mental Health [MH080309]; National Institute on Aging [AG032804]","We thank Daniel Yoo, Dennis Chan, Jessica Jones, Ian Bardenstein and Yasmin Saleem for assisting with data collection.

Results showed that amygdala activation for faces over a scrambled image baseline increased with age. Children, but not adults, showed greater amygdala activation to happy than angry faces; in addition, amygdala activation for angry faces increased with age. In keeping with growing evidence of a positivity bias in young children, our data suggest that children find happy faces to be more salient or meaningful than angry faces. Both children and adults showed preferential activation to mothers' over strangers' faces in a region of rostral anterior cingulate cortex associated with self-evaluation, suggesting that some nodes in frontal evaluative networks are active early in development.

We find that recipients' assumptions about senders' charismatic abilities have important effects on their executive network. Most notably, the Christian participants deactivated the frontal network consisting of the medial and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally in response to speakers who they believed had healing abilities. An independent analysis across subjects revealed that this deactivation predicted the Christian participants' subsequent ratings of the speakers' charisma and experience of God's presence during prayer.

However, demonstrating this phenomenon empirically proves difficult as famous and unknown names, to which self-name is often compared in the studies, may differ from self-name not only in terms of the 'me vs. not-me' distinction, but also as regards their emotional content and frequency of occurrence in everyday life. In this fMRI study, apart from famous and unknown names we used the names of the most important persons in our subjects' lives. When compared to famous or unknown names recognition, self-name recognition was associated with robust activations in widely distributed bilateral network including fronto-temporal, limbic and subcortical structures, however, when compared to significant other's name, the activations were present specifically in the right inferior frontal gyrus. In addition, the significant other's name produced a similar pattern of activations to the one activated by self-name.

Forty adult volunteers performed a risky-choice framing task in which identical information about wins and losses was presented using loss or gain frames. As predicted, there was an inverse association between HRV and framing effects, accounting for 23% of the variance in framing effects.

Using fMRI we show an enhanced amygdala response to regret-related outcomes when these outcomes are associated with high, as compared to low, responsibility. This enhanced response was maximal in participants who showed a greater level of enhancement in their subjective ratings of regret engendered by an objective increase in responsibility. Orbitofrontal and cingulate cortex showed opposite effects, with an enhanced response for regret-related outcomes when participants were not objectively responsible.

Recent research has suggested that this ability may be subserved by a particular brain region: the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). However, although humans can contemplate a variety of different aspects of themselves, including their stable personality traits, current feelings, and physical attributes, no research has directly examined the extent to which these different forms of self-reflection are subserved by common mechanisms. To address this question, participants were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while making judgments about their own personality traits, current mental states, and physical attributes as well as those of another person. Whereas some brain regions responded preferentially during only one form of self-reflection, a robust region of MPFC was engaged preferentially during self-reflection across all three types of judgment.

Supporting this account, research demonstrates that watching others experience physical pain activates similar brain regions to the actual experience of pain itself. First-hand experience of social rejection also activates this network. The current work extends these findings by examining whether the ""pain"" network is similarly implicated in witnessing rejection, and whether emotional closeness modulates this response. We provide evidence for each of these suppositions, demonstrating: (a) that the pain network is activated when watching a friend suffer social rejection, and (b) that interpersonal closeness with that friend modulates this response. Further, we found that the inferior frontal gyrus, critical for representing others' mental and emotional states, mediates the relationship between emotional closeness and neural responses to watching the rejection of a friend.","[Beeney, Joseph E.; Franklin, Robert G., Jr.; Levy, Kenneth N.; Adams, Reginald B., Jr.] Penn State Univ, Dept Psychol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Adams, RB (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Psychol, 544 Moore Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.","rba10@psu.edu","Beeney, Joseph/R-7704-2016","Beeney, Joseph/0000-0001-8685-3597","Social Science Research Institute, Pennsylvania State University","This research was supported by a Social Science Research Institute research grant, Pennsylvania State University, to Reginald B.

Participants (n = 26) performed a cyberball task, a computerized game of catch during which the participants were excluded from the game. Participants then rated the degree of social pain experienced during both inclusion in and exclusion from the game. Individuals with lower trait self-esteem reported increased social pain relative to individuals with higher trait self-esteem, and such individuals also demonstrated a greater degree of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex activation. A psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed a positive connectivity between the dorsal anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortices for the lower trait self-esteem group, and a corresponding negative connectivity for the higher trait self-esteem group. Heightened dorsal anterior cortex activity and a corresponding connection with the prefrontal cortex might be one possible explanation for the greater levels of social pain observed experienced by individuals with low trait self-esteem.","[Onoda, Keiichi; Yamaguchi, Shuhei] Shimane Univ, Fac Med, Dept Neurol, Izumo, Shimane 6938501, Japan; [Okamoto, Yasumasa; Yoshimura, Shinpei; Yamawaki, Sigeto] Hiroshima Univ, Dept Psychiat & Neurosci, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, Div Frontier,Minami Ku, Hiroshima 7348551, Japan; [Nakashima, Ken'ichiro; Nittono, Hiroshi; Ura, Mitsuhiro] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Integrated Arts & Sci, Dept Behav Sci, Higashihiroshima 7398521, Japan","Onoda, K (reprint author), Shimane Univ, Fac Med, Dept Neurol, 89-1 Enyacho, Izumo, Shimane 6938501, Japan.","onodak1@med.shimane-u.ac.jp","Onoda, Keiichi/C-5357-2012; Nittono, Hiroshi/C-4043-2009; Nakashima, Ken'ichiro/A-7975-2018","Nittono, Hiroshi/0000-0001-5671-609X; Onoda, Keiichi/0000-0002-3882-3446","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [19203030, 20790843]","This study was supported by a grant-in-aid for scientific research (A) 19203030 and for young scientists (B) 20790843 from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.","","43","88","93","6","44","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

It is unclear, however, whether these similar behavioral effects are examples of the same attentional phenomenon and, therefore, subserved by the same neural substrate. It has been proposed that gaze, given its evolutionary significance, constitutes a 'special' category of spatial cue. As such, it is predicted that the neural systems supporting spatial reorienting will be different for gaze than for non-biological symbols. We tested this prediction using functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure the brain's response during target localization in which laterally presented targets were preceded by uninformative gaze or arrow cues. Reaction times were faster during valid than invalid trials for both arrow and gaze cues. However, differential patterns of activity were evoked in the brain. Trials including invalid rather than valid arrow cues resulted in a stronger hemodynamic response in the ventral attention network. No such difference was seen during trials including valid and invalid gaze cues.

East Asians and American participants underwent functional imaging while alternating between categorical or thematic strategies to sort triads of words, as well as matching words on control trials. Many similarities were observed. However, across both category and relationship trials compared to match (control) trials, East Asians activated a frontal-parietal network implicated in controlled executive processes, whereas Americans engaged regions of the temporal lobes and the cingulate, possibly in response to conflict in the semantic content of information.

Often this is done by using semantic differentials, in which participants are asked to rate a brand regarding different pairs of adjectives. Only recently, functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI) has been used to examine brands. In the current work we used fMRI in combination with a semantic differential to cross-validate both methods and to improve the characterization of the basic factors constituting the semantic space. To this end we presented pictures of brands while recording subject's brain activity during an fMRI experiment. Results of the semantic differential arranged the brands in a semantic space illustrating their relationships to other cultural symbols. FMRI results revealed activation of the medial prefrontal cortex for brands that loaded high on the factor 'social competence', suggesting an involvement of a cortical network associated with social cognitions. In contrast, brands closely related to the factor 'potency' showed decreased activity in the superior frontal gyri, possibly related to working memory during task performance. We discuss the results as a different engagement of the prefrontal cortex when perceiving brands as cultural symbols.","[Schaefer, Michael; Rotte, Michael] Otto VonGuericke Univ Magdegurg, Dept Neurol, D-39120 Magdeburg, Germany","Schaefer, M (reprint author), Otto VonGuericke Univ Magdegurg, Dept Neurol, D-39120 Magdeburg, Germany.","mischa@neuro2.med.uni-magdeburg.de","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Bayer Vital GmbH","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and the Bayer Vital GmbH.","","28","13","13","1","15","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

Using fMRI procedures, we scanned subjects during two tasks: (i) listening to novel musical examples from their own culture and an unfamiliar culture and (ii) identifying which among a series of brief excerpts were taken from the longer examples. Both groups were more successful remembering music of their home culture. We found greater activation for culturally unfamiliar music listening in the left cerebellar region, right angular gyrus, posterior precuneus and right middle frontal area extending into the inferior frontal cortex.

To investigate this question, we employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while participants performed Biological Motion (BM), Theory-of-Mind (ToM) and Moral Judgment (MJ) tasks. Importantly, for each task we used the same newly developed animated stimuli. Indicative of a common process, we identified small clusters of overlapping activity for BM and ToM in right pSTS and for ToM and MJ in bilateral pSTS and left TPJ. Indicative of distinct processes, on the contrary, we detected extensive dissociable activity for BM in right pSTS, for ToM in bilateral pSTS and left TPJ, and for MJ in bilateral pSTS and TPJ. Thus, our data provide strong evidence for a combined two-staged process account: (i) the parsing of a stream of visual-spatial information, represented by activity in right pSTS, where neighboring and overlapping clusters of increased responses were found for all three tasks; (ii) increasingly more complex processing of the communicative significance of other people's behavior, represented by hierarchically increasing activity in left pSTS and bilateral TPJ elicited by ToM and MJ.","[Bahnemann, Markus; Dziobek, Isabel; Wolf, Ingo; Heekeren, Hauke R.] Max Planck Inst Human Dev, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Bahnemann, Markus; Dziobek, Isabel; Wolf, Ingo; Heekeren, Hauke R.] Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, D-04303 Leipzig, Germany; [Bahnemann, Markus; Heekeren, Hauke R.] Charite, Dept Neurol, Berlin NeuroImaging Ctr, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Dziobek, Isabel; Prehn, Kristin; Wolf, Ingo; Heekeren, Hauke R.] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Educ & Psychol, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Bahnemann, M (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Human Dev, Lentzeallee 94, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.","markus.bahnemann@charite.de; hauke.heekeren@fu-berlin.de","Heekeren, Hauke/B-7739-2008","Heekeren, Hauke/0000-0001-7912-6826; Prehn, Kristin/0000-0002-0656-5323","Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (Berlin NeuroImaging Center, BNIC); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [HE 3347/2-1]","This study was financially supported by grants from the Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (Berlin NeuroImaging Center, BNIC) and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Emmy-Noether-Program (HE 3347/2-1)].

We expected that the perception of motion smoothness would be characterized by great intersubject variability deriving from differences in personal backgrounds and attitudes toward expressive body actions. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a humanoid robot to investigate the effects of the motion smoothness of expressive body actions and the intersubject variability due to personal attitudes on perceptions during dance observation. The effect of motion smoothness was analyzed by both conventional subtraction analysis and functional connectivity analyses that detect cortical networks reflecting intersubject variability. The results showed that the cortical networks of motion- and body-sensitive visual areas showed increases in activity in areas corresponding with motion smoothness, but the intersubject variability of personal attitudes toward art did not influence these active areas. In contrast, activation of cortical networks, including the parieto-frontal network, has large intersubject variability, and this variability is associated with personal attitudes about the consciousness of art.

Previously it has been proposed that processing one's own reputation requires a reputation representation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and a value representation in the striatum. Here, we directly tested this idea using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Subjects disclosed their behavioral tendencies with reference to social norms in the presence or absence of other people, a manipulation that is known to greatly affect an individual's concern for their reputation. The mPFC showed strong activation during self-referential processing, and this activity was enhanced by the mere presence of observers. Moreover, the striatum was also strongly activated when subjects responded in front of observers. Thus, the present study demonstrated that the mPFC and striatum were automatically recruited when the task placed a high demand on processing how one is viewed by others. Taken together, our findings suggest that the mPFC and the striatum play a key role in regulating human social behaviors, and these results provide valuable insight into the neural basis of human altruism.","[Sadato, Norihiro] NIPS, Div Cerebral Integrat, Sect Cerebral Res, Aichi 4448585, Japan; [Izuma, Keise; Sadato, Norihiro] Grad Univ Adv Studies, Kanagawa, Japan; [Sadato, Norihiro] JST RISTEX, Saitama, Japan; [Sadato, Norihiro] Univ Fukui, Fukui 910, Japan; [Saito, Daisuke N.] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Res Inst Sci & Technol Soc RISTEX, Saitama, Japan","Sadato, N (reprint author), NIPS, Div Cerebral Integrat, Sect Cerebral Res, Aichi 4448585, Japan.","sadato@nips.ac.jp","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [17100003, 21220005]","We wish to thank M.

It has been assumed that there is a decreased ability to differentiate between virtuality and reality in people that play these games intensively. FMRI data of a group of young males with (gamers) and without (controls) a history of long-term violent computer game playing experience were obtained during the presentation of computer game and realistic video sequences. In gamers the processing of real violence in contrast to nonviolence produced activation clusters in right inferior frontal, left lingual and superior temporal brain regions. Virtual violence activated a network comprising bilateral inferior frontal, occipital, postcentral, right middle temporal, and left fusiform regions. Control participants showed extended left frontal, insula and superior frontal activations during the processing of real, and posterior activations during the processing of virtual violent scenarios. The data suggest that the ability to differentiate automatically between real and virtual violence has not been diminished by a long-term history of violent video game play, nor have gamers' neural responses to real violence in particular been subject to desensitization processes. However, analyses of individual data indicated that group-related analyses reflect only a small part of actual individual different neural network involvement, suggesting that the consideration of individual learning history is sufficient for the present discussion.","[Fehr, Thorsten] Univ Bremen, Ctr Cognit Sci, Ctr Adv Imaging Bremen Magdeburg, Dept Neuropsychol Behav Neurobiol, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Regenbogen, Christina] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Aachen, Germany","Fehr, T (reprint author), Univ Bremen, Ctr Cognit Sci, Ctr Adv Imaging Bremen Magdeburg, Dept Neuropsychol Behav Neurobiol, Hochschulring 18, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.","fehr@uni-bremen.de","Regenbogen, Christina/A-9691-2016; Fehr, Thorsten/P-5058-2018; Herrmann, Manfred/H-3931-2011","Regenbogen, Christina/0000-0001-5950-798X; Fehr, Thorsten/0000-0002-2224-1740; Herrmann, Manfred/0000-0003-1872-8406","","","","86","20","21","1","26","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1747-0919","1747-0927","","SOC NEUROSCI-UK","Soc.

During the experiment, participants were presented with unfamiliar faces of peers and were asked to predict whether they expected to be liked or disliked by the other person, followed by feedback indicating acceptance or rejection. Results showed that activation in the ventral mPFC and striatum to social feedback was context-dependent; there was increased activation when participants had positive expectations about social evaluation, and increased activation following social acceptance feedback. Age-related comparisons revealed a linear increase in activity with age in these brain regions for positive expectations of social evaluation. Similarly, a linear increase with age was found for activation in the striatum, ventral mPFC, OFC, and lateral PFC for rejection feedback.

Little is known, however, about how neural representations of an anticipated incentive might be influenced by the available alternatives. We used event-related FMRI to investigate the activation in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), while we varied the available alternative incentives in a monetary incentive delay task. Some task blocks included only uncertain gains and losses; others included the same uncertain gains and losses intermixed with certain gains and losses. The availability of certain gains and losses increased NAcc activation for uncertain losses and decreased the difference between uncertain gains and losses. We suggest that this pattern of activation can result from reference point changes across blocks, and that the worst available loss may serve as an important anchor for NAcc activation. These findings imply that NAcc activation represents anticipated incentive value relative to the current context of available alternative gains and losses.","[Cooper, Jeffrey C.; Hollon, Nick G.; Wimmer, G.

Research to date has focused on arousal as a causative factor, while the contribution of appraisal dimensions relating to salience of an item, goal relevance, or impact are yet to be addressed. We explored how differences in ratings of impact influenced amygdala activity to negative emotional images matched for valence, arousal and other factors. Increased amygdala activation was found to high impact when compared to neutral images, or high impact when compared to low impact images (matched for arousal). Our findings demonstrate that the amygdala response to emotional stimuli is not a function of arousal (or valence) alone and accord more with the proposal that the amygdala responds to the significance or relevance of an event.","[Ewbank, Michael P.; Barnard, Philip J.; Ramponi, Cristina; Calder, Andrew J.] MRC, Cognit & Brain Sci Unit, Cambridge CB2 7EF, England; [Croucher, Camilla J.] City Univ London, Dept Psychol, London EC1V 0HB, England","Calder, AJ (reprint author), MRC, Cognit & Brain Sci Unit, 15 Chaucer Rd, Cambridge CB2 7EF, England.","andy.calder@mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk","","Ewbank, Michael/0000-0002-0097-5057; Barnard, Philip/0000-0001-9224-7438","UK Medical Research Council [U. 1055.02.001.0001.01]; Medical Research Council [MC_U105579214, MC_U105579216]","This research was funded by the UK Medical Research Council under project code U. 1055.02.001.0001.01 (A.J.C.).

Afterwards, participants reported their exclusion-related distress and rejection sensitivity, and parents reported participants' interpersonal competence. Similar to findings in adults, during social exclusion adolescents displayed insular activity that was positively related to self-reported distress, and right ventrolateral prefrontal activity that was negatively related to self-reported distress. Findings unique to adolescents indicated that activity in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (subACC) related to greater distress, and that activity in the ventral striatum related to less distress and appeared to play a role in regulating activity in the subACC and other regions involved in emotional distress. Finally, adolescents with higher rejection sensitivity and interpersonal competence scores displayed greater neural evidence of emotional distress, and adolescents with higher interpersonal competence scores also displayed greater neural evidence of regulation, perhaps suggesting that adolescents who are vigilant regarding peer acceptance may be most sensitive to rejection experiences.","[Masten, Carrie L.; Eisenberger, Naomi I.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Masten, Carrie L.; Borofsky, Larissa A.; Mazziotta, John C.; Dapretto, Mirella] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Ahmanson Lovelace Brain Mapping Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Borofsky, Larissa A.; Mazziotta, John C.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Semel Inst Neurosci & Human Behav, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Pfeifer, Jennifer H.] Univ Oregon, Dept Psychol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [McNealy, Kristin; Mazziotta, John C.; Dapretto, Mirella] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Neurosci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [McNealy, Kristin; Dapretto, Mirella] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles Ctr Culture Brain & Dev, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Mazziotta, John C.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Neurol, Dept Pharmacol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Mazziotta, John C.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Radiol Sci, David Geffen Sch Med, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Dapretto, Mirella] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychiat & Biobehav Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Mazziotta, John C.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Brain Res Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Masten, CL (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, 1285 Franz Hall,Box 951563, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.","cmasten@ucla.edu","","Del Piero, Larissa/0000-0002-4407-5472","Santa Fe Institute Consortium; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship; Elizabeth Munsterberg Koppitz Award; Ruth L.

To account for gender differences 16 male and 16 female participants performed an incentive delay task expecting to win either money or positive social feedback. fMRI recording during the anticipation phase revealed proportional activation of neural structures constituting the human reward system for increasing levels of reward, independent of incentive type. However, in men activation in the prospect of monetary rewards encompassed a wide network of mesolimbic brain regions compared to only limited activation for social rewards. In contrast, in women, anticipation of either incentive type activated identical brain regions.

Here we show a neural substrate for responses to babies and babyface overgeneralization in the amygdala and the fusiform face area (FFA). Both regions showed greater percentage BOLD signal change compared with fixation when viewing faces of babies or babyfaced men than maturefaced men. Viewing the first two categories also yielded greater effective connectivity between the two regions. Facial qualities previously shown to elicit strong neural activation could not account for the effects. Babyfaced men were distinguished only by their resemblance to babies. The preparedness to respond to infantile facial qualities generalizes to babyfaced men in perceivers' neural responses just as it does in their behavioral reactions.","[Zebrowitz, Leslie A.] Brandeis Univ, Dept Psychol MS 062, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Aharon, Itzhak] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Martinos Ctr, Cambridge, MA USA","Zebrowitz, LA (reprint author), Brandeis Univ, Dept Psychol MS 062, Waltham, MA 02454 USA.","zebrowitz@brandeis.edu","","Luevano, Victor/0000-0002-4135-3334","NIH [ME066836]; NSF [0315307, K02MH72603]","This work was supported by NIH Grant ME066836 and NSF Grant 0315307 to the first and last authors and K02MH72603 to the first author.

Previous studies have identified an extensive network of brain areas involved in familiar face recognition, but there is little evidence to date concerning the neural bases of negative vs. positive person impressions. In the present study, participants were repeatedly exposed to 16 unfamiliar face identities within a pseudo-interactive game context to generate a perception of either ofriendso or ofoeso. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was then performed during an old/new memory task to assess any difference in brain responses to these now familiar face identities, relative to unfamiliar faces. Importantly, whereas facial expressions were always emotional (either smiling or angry) during the encoding phase, they were always neutral during the memory task. Our results reveal that several brain regions involved in familiar face recognition, including fusiform cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus, and amygdala, plus additional areas involved in motivational control such as caudate and anterior cingulate cortex, were differentially modulated as a function of a previous encounter, and generally more activated when faces were perceived as ofoeso rather than ofriendso. These findings underscore that a key dimension of social judgments, based on past impressions of who may be supportive or hostile, may lead to long-lasting effects on memory for faces and thus influence affective reactions to people during a subsequent encounter even in a different (neutral) context.","[Vrticka, Pascal; Sander, David; Vuilleumier, Patrik] Univ Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland; [Vrticka, Pascal; Andersson, Frederic; Vuilleumier, Patrik] Ctr Med Univ Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland","Vrticka, P (reprint author), Swiss Ctr Affect Sci, 7 Rue Battoirs, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland.","pascal.vrticka@unige.ch","Andersson, Frederic/P-6969-2016; Vrticka, Pascal/U-9166-2018; Vrticka, Pascal/H-2209-2013","Andersson, Frederic/0000-0002-2343-2450; Vrticka, Pascal/0000-0002-8920-5509; Vrticka, Pascal/0000-0002-4806-9037","Swiss National Science Foundation [51NF40-104897]","This research was supported by the National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) Affective Sciences financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation (no. 51NF40-104897) and hosted by the University of Geneva; and grants of the Swiss National Science Foundation to DS and PV.","","68","29","30","1","19","PSYCHOLOGY PRESS","HOVE","27 CHURCH RD, HOVE BN3 2FA, EAST SUSSEX, ENGLAND","1747-0919","","","SOC NEUROSCI","Soc.

The increased scrutiny highlighted the lack of controlled oreal lifeo, i.e. prospective clinical trials of this technology that conform to the common standards of medical device development. The ethics of conducting such trials given the paucity of data on fMRI-based lie detection has also been questioned. To probe the potential issues of translating the laboratory research into practice, we conducted a case study in which we adapted the standard Guilty Knowledge Test (GKT), a well-established model of producing deception, to the common scenario of lying on a resume. The task consisted of questions about pertinent items on the subject's resume, three of which could be independently verified as truth (KNOWN) and three that could not be verified and were thus termed UNKNOWN. The subject had an incentive to lie on all UNKNOWN items, and on debriefing confirmed that he had done so. Data was preprocessed, masked with a priori regions of interest, thresholded, and qualitatively evaluated for consistency with the previously reported prefronto-parietal Lie Truth pattern. Deceptive responses to two out of the three UNKNOWN items were associated with the predicted prefronto-parietal fMRI pattern. In the third UNKNOWN this pattern was absent, and instead, increased limbic (amygdala and hippocampus) response was observed. Based on published prefronto-parietal Lie response pattern, only the first two items could be categorized as Lie. If confirmed, this demonstration of amygdala and hippocampus activation in a Lie Truth contrast illustrates the need to integrate the limbic system and its emotional and cognitive correlates into the existing model of deception. Our experiment suggests an approach to a naturalistic scenario and the research questions that need to be answered in order to set the stage for prospective clinical trials of fMRI-based lie detection.","[Langleben, D.

We assessed the difference between truthful and deceptive IRTs. Scores from cognitive tasks included in the MiniCog Rapid Assessment Battery (MRAB) were significant predictors of IRT differences.

In this neuroimaging study, participants saw images of an anthropomorphic robot that moved its eyes left- or rightwards to signal the appearance of an upcoming stimulus in the same (valid cue) or opposite location (invalid cue). Independently, participants' beliefs about the intentionality underlying the observed eye movements were manipulated by describing the eye movements as under human control or preprogrammed. As expected, we observed a validity effect behaviorally and neurologically (increased response times and activation in the invalid vs. valid condition). More importantly, we observed that this effect was more pronounced for the condition in which the robot's behavior was believed to be controlled by a human, as opposed to be preprogrammed. This interaction effect between cue validity and belief was, however, only found at the neural level and was manifested as a significant increase of activation in bilateral anterior temporoparietal junction.","[Ozdem, Ceylan; Van Overwalle, Frank] Vrije Univ Brussels, Dept Psychol, Pleinlaan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Wiese, Eva] George Mason Univ, Dept Psychol, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Wiese, Eva; Mueller, Hermann] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Psychol, Munich, Germany; [Wykowska, Agnieszka] Lulea Univ Technol, Div Human Work Sci, Engn Psychol, Lulea, Sweden; [Wykowska, Agnieszka] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Cognit Syst, Munich, Germany; [Brass, Marcel] Univ Ghent, Ghent Inst Funct & Metab Imaging, Ghent, Belgium","Van Overwalle, F (reprint author), Vrije Univ Brussels, Dept Psychol, Pleinlaan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.","Frank.VanOverwalle@vub.ac.be","","Van Overwalle, Frank/0000-0002-2538-9847","Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) Grant; Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek [FWOAL556]","This research was supported by Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) Grant to Frank Van Overwalle, and performed at GIfMI (Ghent Institute for Functional and Metabolic Imaging); Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek [FWOAL556].","","36","7","7","0","7","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1747-0919","1747-0927","","SOC NEUROSCI-UK","Soc.

Those same people are often less inclined to steal the same physical item from a shop. This raises the question, why do people have fewer reservations with stealing intangible items compared to tangible? Using questionnaires and fMRI we provide evidence across three studies as to the differences between tangible and intangible theft. In a questionnaire (Study 1), participants revealed that across different conditions they were more willing to steal intangible compared to tangible goods. Study 2a used fMRI to reveal that a network involved in imagining objects was more active when participants were representing intangible versus tangible objects, suggesting people have greater difficulty representing intangible items. Study 2b used fMRI to show that when stealing tangible objects versus intangible, participants had increased activation in left lateral orbitofrontal cortex, an area typically activated in response to morally laden situations. The findings from the current investigation provide novel insights into the higher prevalence of intangible theft and suggest that differential neural representation of tangible and intangible items may, in part, explain why people are more willing to steal intangible items.","[Eres, Robert; Molenberghs, Pascal] Monash Univ, Sch Psychol Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Eres, Robert; Molenberghs, Pascal] Monash Univ, Monash Inst Cognit & Clin Neurosci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Louis, Winnifred R.] Univ Queensland, Sch Psychol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia","Molenberghs, P (reprint author), Monash Univ, Sch Psychol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.; Molenberghs, P (reprint author), Monash Univ, Monash Inst Cognit & Clin Neurosci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.","pascal.molenberghs@monash.edu","","Louis, Winnifred/0000-0003-2996-982X; Molenberghs, Pascal/0000-0003-0350-6659","ARC Discovery Early Career Research Award [DE130100120]; Heart Foundation Future Leader Fellowship [100458]; ARC Discovery [DP130100559, DP1092490]; Australian Postgraduate Award","This project was funded by an ARC Discovery Early Career Research Award [grant number DE130100120]; Heart Foundation Future Leader Fellowship [grant number 100458]; and an ARC Discovery: [grant number DP130100559]; awarded to P.M., Australian Postgraduate Award awarded to R.E., and an ARC Discovery: [grant number DP1092490] awarded to W.L.","","64","2","2","2","6","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1747-0919","1747-0927","","SOC NEUROSCI-UK","Soc.

Given this finding, we sought to test whether masked fearful eye whites would produce a similar profile of amygdala response in a face vs non-face context. During functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning sessions, 30 participants viewed fearful or happy eye whites masked with either neutral faces or pattern images. Results indicated amygdala activity was increased to fearful vs happy eye whites in the face mask condition, but decreased to fearful vs happy eye whites in the pattern mask condition-effectively replicating and expanding our previous report.

People vary widely in their metacognitive ability and in general are too confident when evaluating their performance. This often leads to poor decision making with potentially disastrous consequences. To further our understanding of the neural underpinnings of these processes, this fMRI study investigated inter-individual differences in metacognitive ability and effects of trial-by-trial variation in subjective feelings of confidence when making metacognitive assessments. Participants (N = 308) evaluated their performance in a high-level social and cognitive reasoning task. The results showed that higher metacognitive accuracy was associated with a decrease in activation in the anterior medial prefrontal cortex, an area previously linked to metacognition on perception and memory. Moreover, the feeling of confidence about one's choices was associated with an increase of activation in reward, memory and motor related areas including bilateral striatum and hippocampus, while less confidence was associated with activation in areas linked with negative affect and uncertainty, including dorsomedial prefrontal and bilateral orbitofrontal cortex. This might indicate that positive affect is related to higher confidence thereby biasing metacognitive decisions towards overconfidence. In support, behavioural analyses revealed that increased confidence was associated with lower metacognitive accuracy.","[Molenberghs, Pascal] Monash Univ, Sch Psychol Sci, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Molenberghs, Pascal] Monash Univ, Monash Inst Cognit & Clin Neurosci, 18 Innovat Walk, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Trautwein, Fynn-Mathis; Bockler, Anne; Singer, Tania; Kanske, Philipp] Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Dept Social Neurosci, Leipzig, Germany","Molenberghs, P (reprint author), Monash Univ, Monash Inst Cognit & Clin Neurosci, 18 Innovat Walk, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.","pascal.molenberghs@monash.edu","","Kanske, Philipp/0000-0003-2027-8782; Molenberghs, Pascal/0000-0003-0350-6659","European Research Council under the European Community [205557]; Max Planck Society; Australian Research Council (ARC) [DE130100120]; Heart Foundation Future Leader Fellowship [100458]; ARC Discovery Grant [DP130100559]","T.S. as principal investigator, received funding for the ReSource Project from the European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Program (FP7/20072013/ERC grant agreement no. 205557) and from the Max Planck Society.

This study uses the same experimental design with fMRI and relies on an event-related analysis of BOLD signal changes. Findings reveal that threat-related cognitive facilitation (improved NoGo accuracy) is associated with greater activation of a right-lateralized frontoparietal group of regions previously implicated in sustained attention and response inhibition. Moreover, these same regions show decreased activation in the Go trials preceding NoGo errors. During NoGo trials, striatal activity is also greater in the threat vs safe condition, consistent with the notion of enhanced inhibitory processing under threat.

Two weeks later, participants' self-reported smoking behavior and biomarkers of smoking behavior were reassessed. We compared multiple models predicting change in self-reported smoking behavior (cigarettes per day [CPD]) and change in a biomarkers of smoke exposure (expired carbon monoxide [CO]). Brain activity in the vmPFC and amygdala not only predicted changes in CO, but also accounted for outcome variance above and beyond self-report data. Neural data were most useful in predicting behavioral change as quantified by the objective biomarker (CO). This pattern of activity was significantly modulated by individuals' intention to quit. The finding that both cognitive (vmPFC) and affective (amygdala) brain areas contributed to these models supports the idea that smokers respond to HWLs in a cognitive-affective manner.

However, research on reappraisal to date has examined almost exclusively its effect on the intensity of responses while failing to examine its effect on the duration of responses. To address this, we used inverse logit functions to estimate the height and duration of hemodynamic responses to negative pictures when individuals with recent life stress were instructed to use reappraisal either to decrease their negative emotion or to increase their positive emotion (relative to unregulated viewing of negative pictures). Several emotion-generative regions such as the amygdala, thalamus and midbrain exhibited decreases in duration of activation, even when controlling for differences in height of activation. In addition, whereas the amygdala exhibited both decreased activation height and duration when participants reappraised to decrease their negative emotion, it only exhibited decreased duration when participants reappraised to increase their positive emotion. These results indicate that emotion regulation alters the temporal dynamics of emotional responding and that models of reappraisal should accommodate whether reappraisal influences the height of activation, duration of activation or both, which may change based on the goal of the reappraisal strategy being used.","[Waugh, Christian E.; Sams, Katherine V.] Wake Forest Univ, POB 7778, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA; [Zarolia, Pareezad; Lumian, Daniel S.; Ciesielski, Bethany G.; Mcrae, Kateri] Univ Denver, Denver, CO 80208 USA; [Mauss, Iris B.; Ford, Brett Q.; Davis, Tchikima S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lumian, Daniel S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA","Waugh, CE (reprint author), Wake Forest Univ, POB 7778, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA.","waughce@wfu.edu","Waugh, Christian/F-8613-2015","Waugh, Christian/0000-0002-7871-5845","John Templeton Foundation","This research was supported by a grant to Iris B.

Initial acts of self-control temporarily impair subsequent self-control performance. Why such self-control failures occur is unclear, with prominent models postulating a loss of a limited resource vs a loss of motivation, respectively. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify the neural correlates of motivation-induced benefits on self-control. Participants initially exerted or did not exert self-control. In a subsequent Stroop task, participants performed worse after exerting self-control, but not if they were motivated to perform well by monetary incentives. On the neural level, having exerted self-control resulted in decreased activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus. Increasing motivation resulted in a particularly strong activation of this area specifically after exerting self-control. Thus, after self-control exertion participants showed more prefrontal neural activity without improving performance beyond baseline level. These findings suggest that impaired performance after self-control exertion may not exclusively be due to a loss of motivation.","[Luethi, Matthias S.; Binder, Julia; Rasch, Bjorn] Univ Zurich, Dept Psychol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Luethi, Matthias S.] Univ Basel, Dept Psychol, Basel, Switzerland; [Friese, Malte] Univ Saarland, Dept Psychol, Saarbrucken, Germany; [Boesiger, Peter; Luechinger, Roger] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Biomed Engn, Zurich, Switzerland; [Boesiger, Peter; Luechinger, Roger] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Rasch, Bjorn] Univ Fribourg, Dept Psychol, Fribourg, Switzerland","Friese, M (reprint author), Univ Saarland, Div Social Psychol, Dept Psychol, POB 151150, D-66041 Saarbrucken, Germany.","malte.friese@uni-saarland.de","","Luechinger, Roger/0000-0002-7365-0421","Swiss National Science Foundation [100014_138630, 100014_162388]","This work was supported by grants from the Swiss National Science Foundation to M.F. and B.R.

Recent neuroimaging studies in the context of smoking cessation, point to personal relevance as one of the key variables that determine the effectiveness of public health messages. While minority men who have sex with men (MSM) are at the highest risk of HIV infection, most safe-sex ads feature predominantly Caucasian actors in heterosexual scenarios. We compared brain respons of 45 African American MSM to safe sex ads that were matched (i.e. 'Targeted') to participants' sexual orientation and race, and 'Untargeted' ads that were un matched for these characteristics. Ad recall, perceived 'convincingness' and attitudes towards condom use were also assessed. We found that Targeted ads were better remembered than the Untargeted ads but perceived as equally convincing. Targeted ads engaged brain regions involved in self-referential processing and memory, including the amygdala, hippocampus, temporal and medial prefrontal cortices (MPFC) and the precuneus. Connectivity between MPFC and precuneus and middle temporal gyrus was stronger when viewing Targeted ads. Our results suggest that targeting may increase cognitive processing of safe sex ads and justify further prospective studies linking brain response to media public health interventions and clinical outcomes.","[Wang, An-Li; Shi, Zhenhao; Metzger, David S.; Langleben, Daniel D.] Univ Penn, Dept Psychiat, Perelman Sch Med, 3900 Chestnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Lowen, Steven B.] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Psychiat, Cambridge, MA USA; [Bissey, Bryn; Langleben, Daniel D.] Univ Penn, Annenberg Publ Policy Ctr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Langleben, Daniel D.] Vet Adm Med Ctr, Behav Hlth Serv, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Wang, AL (reprint author), Univ Penn, Dept Psychiat, Perelman Sch Med, 3900 Chestnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.","anliwang@mail.med.upenn.edu","","","National Institute on Drug Abuse [DA035683]; Penn Mental Health AIDS Research Center [P30MH097488]","This research was supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse RO3 (DA035683) and a developmental award from the Penn Mental Health AIDS Research Center (P30MH097488).","","73","3","3","1","15","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

Here, we tested whether high self-reported self-control is related to successful emotion regulation on the behavioral and neural level. One hundred eight participants completed three self-control questionnaires and regulated their negative emotions during functional magnetic resonance imaging using reappraisal (distancing). Trait self-control correlated positively with successful emotion regulation both subjectively and neurally, as indicated by online ratings of negative emotions and functional connectivity strength between the amygdala and prefrontal areas, respectively. This stronger overall connectivity of the left amygdala was related to more successful subjective emotion regulation. Comparing amygdala activity over time showed that high self-controllers successfully maintained down-regulation of the left amygdala over time, while low self-controllers failed to down-regulate towards the end of the experiment. This indicates that high self-controllers are better at maintaining a motivated state supporting emotion regulation over time. Our results support assumptions concerning a close relation of self-control and emotion regulation as two domains of behavioral control.

Functional imaging studies of reappraisal have shown broad engagement of bilateral middle frontal cortex (MFC) and left superior frontal cortex (SFC), and specific engagement of the right SFC. However, volumetric studies have not identified clear associations between reappraisal and these regions. This discrepancy between functional and structural studies suggests that broad functional engagement associated with reappraisal might not be detectable at a structural level using highly localized volumetric measures. This study addressed the discrepant structural findings by assessing the relation between reappraisal and grey matter volume, using methods that allow both region-level broad/diffuse assessments (surface-based morphometry), and voxel-level specific/localized (voxel-based morphometry) measures. Results were consistent with diffuse positive volumetric associations with reappraisal in the right MFC and left SFC, and a localized positive volumetric association in the right SFC, thus resolving the discrepancy between functional and structural studies. This study provides novel evidence supporting the idea that functional engagement related to transient manipulations of reappraisal can be linked to structural associations related to habitual engagement of similar operations, within the same brain regions.","[Moore, M.; Hu, Y.; Dolcos, S.; Dolcos, F.] Univ Illinois, Dept Psychol, Urbana, IL USA; [Iordan, A.

Prior neuroimaging studies have shown that why and how questions about actions differentially activate two cortical networks associated with mental-state reasoning and action representation, respectively; however, it remains unknown whether this is due to the differential demands of the questions per se or to the shifts in LOA those questions produce. We conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants judged pairs of action phrases that varied in LOA and that could be framed either as a why question (Why ride a bike? Get exercise.) or a how question (How to get exercise? Ride a bike.). Question framing (why vs how) had no effect on activity in regions of the two networks. Instead, these regions uniquely tracked parametric variation in LOA, both across and within trials. This suggests that the human capacity to understand actions at different LOA is based in the relative activity of two cortical networks.","[Spunt, Robert P.; Adolphs, Ralph] CALTECH, 1200 E Calif Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Kemmerer, David] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Spunt, RP (reprint author), CALTECH, 1200 E Calif Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.","spunt@caltech.edu","Spunt, Robert/O-9887-2014","Spunt, Robert/0000-0003-2975-4597","National Institutes of Health [R01 MH080721-03]","This work was supported in part by the National Institutes of Health (R01 MH080721-03 to R.A.).","","71","12","12","1","6","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

This study was designed to bridge these literatures to investigate the neurocognitive mechanisms linking subjective social status and inflammation. Thirty-one participants reported their subjective social status, and underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan while they were socially evaluated. Participants also provided blood samples before and after the stressor, which were analysed for changes in inflammation. Results showed that lower subjective social status was associated with greater increases in inflammation. Neuroimaging data revealed lower subjective social status was associated with greater neural activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex ( DMPFC) in response to negative feedback. Finally, results indicated that activation in the DMPFC in response to negative feedback mediated the relation between social status and increases in inflammatory activity. This study provides the first evidence of a neurocognitive pathway linking subjective social status and inflammation, thus furthering our understanding of how social hierarchies shape neural and physiological responses to social interactions.","[Muscatell, Keely A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Robert Wood Johnson Fdn Hlth & Soc Scholars Progr, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Muscatell, Keely A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94118 USA; [Muscatell, Keely A.; Dedovic, Katarina; Bower, Julienne E.; Irwin, Michael R.; Eisenberger, Naomi I.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Dedovic, Katarina] McGill Univ, Dept Psychiat, Res Ctr, Douglas Mental Hlth Univ Inst, Montreal, PQ H4H1R3, Canada; [Slavich, George M.; Jarcho, Michael R.; Breen, Elizabeth C.; Bower, Julienne E.; Irwin, Michael R.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychiat & Biobehav Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Slavich, George M.; Jarcho, Michael R.; Breen, Elizabeth C.; Bower, Julienne E.; Irwin, Michael R.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Cousins Ctr Psychoneuroimmunol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Jarcho, Michael R.] Loras Coll, Dept Neurosci, Dubuque, IA 52011 USA","Muscatell, KA (reprint author), UCSF Ctr Hlth & Community, RWJF Hlth & Soc Scholars Program, 3333 Calif St Suite 465, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA.","kmuscatell@berkeley.edu","Irwin, Michael/H-4870-2013","Irwin, Michael/0000-0002-1502-8431","National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression (NARSAD) Young Investigator Award; UCLA Cousins Center for Psychoneuroimmunology; UCLA Clinical & Translational Science Institute (CTSI); NIH/National Center for Advancing Translational Science (NCATS) UCLA CTSI [UL1TR000124]; UCLA Older Americans Independence Center Inflammatory Biology Core - NIA/NIH [AG028748]; Canadian Institutes of Health Research; National Science Foundation; NIH [T32 MH015750]","This work was supported by a National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression (NARSAD) Young Investigator Award (NIE), a UCLA Cousins Center for Psychoneuroimmunology Seed Grant (NIE), a UCLA Clinical & Translational Science Institute (CTSI) Seed Grant (NIE), the NIH/National Center for Advancing Translational Science (NCATS) UCLA CTSI [Grant Number UL1TR000124], the UCLA Older Americans Independence Center Inflammatory Biology Core (funded by NIA/NIH) [Grant Number AG028748], a Canadian Institutes of Health Research Post-Doctoral Research Fellowship (K.D.), a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (K.A.M.), and NIH Pre-Doctoral Institutional Training [Grant T32 MH015750 (K.A.M.)].","","50","12","13","0","11","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

Short sentences, which were presented visually, consisted of self-relevant statements and a substantive verb, which indicated sentence polarity as either affirmative or negative. Each sentence was divided into the contents and the sentence ending, and the subjects were asked to respond with either agreement or disagreement after the complete sentence was presented. The overall group analysis suggested that the intention of the sentence response was found even before the reading of the complete sentences. Increased neural activation was found in the left medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) during feelings of agreement compared to feelings of disagreement during self-relevant decision-making. In addition, according to the sentence ending, the decision of a response activated the frontopolar cortex (FPC) in the switching condition. These findings indicated that the implicit intentions of responses to the given statements were internally generated before an explicit response occurred, and, hence, intentions can be used to predict a subject's future answer.","[Dong, Suh-Yeon; Kim, Bo-Kyeong; Lee, Soo-Young] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, 291 Daehak Ro, Daejeon, South Korea","Lee, SY (reprint author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, 291 Daehak Ro, Daejeon, South Korea.","sylee@kaist.ac.kr","Lee, Soo-Young/C-1930-2011",", Suh-Yeon/0000-0002-2960-7303","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education, Science and Technology [2013-035100]; Asian Office of Aerospace R&D (AOARD), U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory","This research was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology [2013-035100], and the Asian Office of Aerospace R&D (AOARD), U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory.","","47","2","2","1","13","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND","1747-0919","1747-0927","","SOC NEUROSCI-UK","Soc.

The second, recollected guilt, requires participants to reflect on times they personally experienced guilt. In the fMRI scanner, participants were presented with guilt/neutral memories and guilt/neutral hypothetical scenarios. Contrasts confirmed a priori predictions that guilt memories, relative to guilt scenarios, were associated with significantly greater activity in regions associated with affect [anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), Caudate, Insula, orbital frontal cortex (OFC)] and social cognition [temporal pole (TP), precuneus). Similarly, results indicated that guilt memories, relative to neutral memories, were also associated with greater activity in affective (ACC, amygdala, Insula, OFC) and social cognition (mPFC, TP, precuneus, temporo-parietal junction) regions. There were no significant differences between guilt hypothetical scenarios and neutral hypothetical scenarios in either affective or social cognition regions.

Adequate responses to threat-related voices under such conditions require that the brain unmixes reciprocally masked features depending on variable cognitive resources. It is unknown which brain systems instantiate the extraction of behaviorally relevant prosodic features under varying combinations of prosody valence, auditory background complexity and attentional focus. Here, we used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the effects of high background sound complexity and attentional focus on brain activation to angry and neutral prosody in humans. Results show that prosody effects in mid superior temporal cortex were gated by background complexity but not attention, while prosody effects in the amygdala and anterior superior temporal cortex were gated by attention but not background complexity, suggesting distinct emotional prosody processing limitations in different regions. Crucially, if attention was focused on the highly complex background, the differential processing of emotional prosody was prevented in all brain regions, suggesting that in a distracting, complex auditory world even threatening voices may go unnoticed.","[Mothes-Lasch, Martin; Becker, Michael P.

Nevertheless, the number of neuroscientific studies conducted on this issue is scarce as compared with studies of other types of violence, and no neuroimaging studies comparing batterers to other criminals have been conducted. Thus, the main aim of this study was to compare the brain functioning of batterers to that of other criminals when they are exposed to IPV or general violence pictures. An fMRI study was conducted in 21 batterers and 20 other criminals while they observed IPV images (IPVI), general violence images (GVI) and neutral images (NI). Results demonstrated that batterers, compared with other criminals, exhibited a higher activation in the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex and in the middle prefrontal cortex and a decreased activation in the superior prefrontal cortex to IPVI compared to NI. The paired t-test comparison between IPVI and GVI for each group showed engagement of the medial prefrontal cortex, the posterior cingulate and the left angular cortices to IPVI in the batterer group only. These results could have important implications for a better understanding of the IPV phenomenon.","[Bueso-Izquierdo, Natalia; Verdejo-Roman, Juan; Carmona-Perera, Martina; Perez-Garcia, Miguel] Univ Granada UGR, Dept Personal Assessment & Psychol Treatment, Sch Psychol, Granada, Spain; [Bueso-Izquierdo, Natalia; Verdejo-Roman, Juan; Carmona-Perera, Martina; Perez-Garcia, Miguel; Hidalgo-Ruzzante, Natalia] Univ Granada CIMCYC UGR, Brain Mind & Behav Res Ctr, Granada, Spain; [Contreras-Rodriguez, Oren] Univ Granada, Inst Neurosci Fed Oloriz, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Contreras-Rodriguez, Oren] Bellvitge Univ Hosp, Bellvitge Biomed Res Inst IDIBELL, CIBERSAM, Dept Psychiat, Barcelona, Spain; [Perez-Garcia, Miguel] UGR Spain, Ctr Invest Biomed Red Salud Mental CIBERSAM, Granada, Spain; [Hidalgo-Ruzzante, Natalia] Univ Granada UGR, Dept Dev & Educ Psychol, Sch Educ, Granada, Spain","Bueso-Izquierdo, N (reprint author), Univ Granada UGR, Dept Personal Assessment & Psychol Treatment, Granada, Spain.","nbueso@ugr.es","Perez-Garcia, Miguel/F-9630-2010; Verdejo Roman, Juan/B-5188-2017","Perez-Garcia, Miguel/0000-0003-4775-7556; Verdejo Roman, Juan/0000-0001-5112-8918; Bueso Izquierdo, Natalia/0000-0002-2469-8867","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [PSI 2009-13585]; Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [PSI2013-42792-R]; Regional Ministry of Economy, Innovation and Science from Andalusian Government [P2012-SEJ1723]; Carlos III Health Institute [CD14/00246]","This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (Project: PSI 2009-13585), Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Project: PSI2013-42792-R), and Regional Ministry of Economy, Innovation and Science from Andalusian Government (Project: P2012-SEJ1723).

Here, we asked how humans alter their economic decision-making in response to emotional cues, and whether this is related to trait anxiety. Developing an emotional decision-making task for functional magnetic resonance imaging, in which gambling decisions were preceded by emotional and non-emotional primes, we assessed emotional influences on loss aversion, the tendency to overweigh potential monetary losses relative to gains. Our behavioral results revealed that only low-anxious individuals exhibited increased loss aversion under emotional conditions. This emotional modulation of decision-making was accompanied by a corresponding emotion-elicited increase in amygdala-striatal functional connectivity, which correlated with the behavioral effect across participants. Consistent with prior reports of 'neural loss aversion', both amygdala and ventral striatum tracked losses more strongly than gains, and amygdala loss aversion signals were exaggerated by emotion, suggesting a potential role for this structure in integrating value and emotion cues. Increased loss aversion and striatal-amygdala coupling induced by emotional cues may reflect the engagement of adaptive harm-avoidance mechanisms in low-anxious individuals, possibly promoting resilience to psychopathology.","[Charpentier, Caroline J.; Sim, Alena L.; Roiser, Jonathan P.] UCL, Inst Cognit Neurosci, London WC1N 3AZ, England; [Charpentier, Caroline J.; Sharot, Tali] UCL, Dept Expt Psychol, Affect Brain Lab, London WC1H 0AP, England; [De Martino, Benedetto] Univ Cambridge, Dept Psychol, Cambridge CB2 3EB, England","Charpentier, CJ (reprint author), Inst Cognit Neurosci, 17 Queen Sq, London WC1N 3AZ, England.","caroline.charpentier.11@ucl.ac.uk","","De Martino, Benedetto/0000-0002-3555-2732","University College London Grand Challenge award; Wellcome Trust Career Development Fellowship","This work was supported by a University College London Grand Challenge award to C.J.C. and J.P.R. and Wellcome Trust Career Development Fellowship to T.S.","","60","7","7","0","21","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

Interestingly, the activation pattern of the AI was mirrored by feelings of guilt and shame.

Behavioral data showed that when participants were in high status, they were more likely to reject unfair UG offers than in low status. This effect of social status correlated with activity in the right anterior insula (rAI) and with the functional connectivity between the rAI and a region in the anterior middle cingulate cortex, indicating that these two brain regions are crucial for integrating contextual factors and social norms during fairness perception. Additionally, there was an interaction between social status and UG offer fairness in the amygdala and thalamus, implicating the role of these regions in the modulation of social status on fairness perception.

In this study, we examine the neural correlates of social influence from both parents and peers, two important sources of influence. Nineteen adolescents (age 16-18 years) completed a social influence task during a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan. Social influence from both sources evoked activity in brain regions implicated in mentalizing (medial prefrontal cortex, left temporoparietal junction, right temporoparietal junction), reward (ventromedial prefrontal cortex), and self-control (right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex). These results suggest that mental state reasoning, social reward and self-control processes may help adolescents to evaluate others' perspectives and overcome the prepotent force of their own antecedent attitudes to shift their attitudes toward those of others.

We used repetition suppression, which is a rapid suppression of the neuroimaging signal upon repeated presentation of the same stimulus or core stimulus characteristics-in this case, the implied trait and person. Participants inferred familiar person's traits. At each trial, a critical (target) sentence described a behavior that implied a trait, and was preceded by a (prime) sentence that implied the same trait and portrayed the same person, the same trait but portrayed a different person or did not imply a trait and portrayed a different person. As predicted, we found partly overlapping repetition suppression areas in the ventral mPFC when persons and traits were repeated, indicating that not only traits but also familiar persons have a neural code in the ventral mPFC. We also found a negative correlation between activation when reading about a new person and participants' social network size, indicating that experience with larger social groups results in less recruitment of a person code.","[Heleven, Elien; Van Overwalle, Frank] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Psychol, Pleinlaan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium","Heleven, E (reprint author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Psychol, Pleinlaan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.","Frank.VanOverwalle@vub.ac.be","","","Vrije Universiteit Brussel [SRP15]","SRP15 project funded by the Vrije Universiteit Brussel.","","48","11","11","0","8","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

An extensive body of behavioral research has revealed that DG ability in childhood is associated with a host of important outcomes throughout development, and that attentional focus away from temptations underlies this ability. In this study, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging study to identify the neural underpinnings of individual differences in DG among children. We observed a relationship between behavior during the classic DG task, a well-studied and ecologically valid measure, and functional connectivity during a modified version of this task in the scanner. Specifically, greater attentional focus away from temptations was associated with stronger functional coupling between the nucleus accumbens, a brain region that supports approach behavior, and several regions within prefrontal and parietal cortex that support self-control.

Participants were faster to shoot armed Blacks than Whites, but faster in making don't shoot responses to unarmed Whites than Blacks. Brain activity differed to armed versus unarmed targets depending on target race, suggesting different mechanisms underlying threat versus safety decisions.

One example is warfare, where killing enemy soldiers is seen as morally justified. Yet, the neural underpinnings distinguishing between justified and unjustified killing are largely unknown. To improve understanding of the neural processes involved in justified and unjustified killing, participants had to imagine being the perpetrator whilst watching 'first-person perspective' animated videos where they shot enemy soldiers ('justified violence') and innocent civilians ('unjustified violence'). When participants imagined themselves shooting civilians compared with soldiers, greater activation was found in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Regression analysis revealed that the more guilt participants felt about shooting civilians, the greater the response in the lateral OFC. Effective connectivity analyses further revealed an increased coupling between lateral OFC and the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) when shooting civilians. The results show that the neural mechanisms typically implicated with harming others, such as the OFC, become less active when the violence against a particular group is seen as justified.

Here, we investigated the effects of an alternative emotion regulation technique based on the up-regulation of positive affect via Compassion-meditation on experiential and neural affective responses to depictions of individuals in distress, and compared these with the established emotion regulation strategy of Reappraisal. Using fMRI, we scanned 15 expert practitioners of Compassion-meditation either passively viewing, or using Compassion-meditation or Reappraisal to modulate their emotional reactions to film clips depicting people in distress. Both strategies effectively, but differentially regulated experienced affect, with Compassion primarily increasing positive and Reappraisal primarily decreasing negative affect. Imaging results showed that Compassion, relative to both passive-viewing and Reappraisal increased activation in regions involved in affiliation, positive affect and reward processing including ventral striatum and medial orbitfrontal cortex. This network was shown to be active prior to stimulus presentation, suggesting that the regulatory mechanism of Compassion is the stimulus-independent endogenous generation of positive affect.","[Engen, Haakon G.; Singer, Tania] Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Dept Social Neurosci, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany","Engen, HG (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Dept Social Neurosci, Stephanstr 1a, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.","engen@cbs.mpg.de","","","European Research Council under European Community/ERC [205557]","The authors would like to thank Tor Wager and Luka Ruzic for their help with the subcortical rendering scripts.

To date, however, the dynamical interplay among these networks is largely unexplored during successful or unsuccessful WM performance, especially with complex and ecological stimuli. Here we systematically characterized the selective contribution of these networks during a visuospatial WM task requiring the encoding, maintenance and retrieval of real-life scenes. While undergoing fMRI scans, participants were presented with everyday life visual scenes for 4 s (encoding phase). After a delay of 8 s (maintenance phase), participants were presented with a target-object extracted from the previous scene. Participants had to judge whether the target-object was presented at the same or in a different location compared to the original scene (retrieval phase) and then provide a confidence judgment. Using the independent component analysis (ICA), we found that subsequent remembering was associated with the activity of the AN at encoding, the attention and SN at maintenance, plus the visual network at retrieval. Conversely, subsequent forgetting was associated with the activity of the DMN at maintenance, and the SN at retrieval. Overall, these findings reveal a dynamical interplay between large-scale brain networks during visuospatial WM performance related to complex, real-life stimuli.","[Santangelo, Valerio] Univ Perugia, Dept Philosophy Social Sci & Educ, Perugia, Italy; [Santangelo, Valerio] Santa Lucia Fdn, Neuroimaging Lab, Rome, Italy; [Bordier, Cecile] Ist Italiano Tecnol, Ctr Neurosci & Cognit Syst, Rovereto, Italy","Santangelo, V (reprint author), Univ Perugia, Dept Philosophy Social Sci & Educ, Perugia, Italy.; Santangelo, V (reprint author), Santa Lucia Fdn, Neuroimaging Lab, Rome, Italy.","valerio.santangelo@unipg.it","","","","","","53","0","0","0","0","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","1664-1078","","","FRONT PSYCHOL","Front.

Significantly stronger activations were observed in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and anterior insula (AI) when making decisions for the self than for others in loss situations but not in gain situations. Furthermore, the activation in the dmPFC was stronger when people made sure choices for others than for themselves in gain situations but not when they made risky choices, and was both stronger when people made sure and risky choices for themselves than for others in loss situations.

Additionally, sleep loss alters functional activation within brain regions associated with reward and behavioral control. However, it remains unknown whether individual differences in baseline neural functioning can predict eating behaviors during total sleep deprivation (TSD). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test the hypothesis that individuals with increased baseline responsiveness within reward regions are more vulnerable to TSD-induced overeating. Methods: N = 45 subjects completed several fMRI scans during a single pre-TSD session that included performance on the Multi-Source Interference Task (MSIT) and the n-back task. Subjects returned to the laboratory for an overnight TSD session, during which they were given ad libitum access to 10,900 kcal of food. Leftover food and packaging were collected every 6 h (00:00, 06:00, and 12:00) to measure total food consumption. Subjects reported sleepiness every hour and performed a food rating task every 3 h. Results: Functional activation within the ventral striatum during the MSIT and n-back positively correlated with total caloric and carbohydrate intake during the final 6 h (06:00-12:00) of TSD. Activation within the middle and superior temporal gyri during the MSIT also correlated with total carbohydrates consumed. Food consumption did not correlate with subjective sleepiness, hunger, or food desire. Conclusions: Individual differences in neural activity of reward processing areas (i.e., nucleus accumbens) prior to sleep deprivation are associated with an individual's propensity to overeat during subsequent sleep deprivation. This suggests that individual differences within reward processing pathways are potential key factors in sleep loss related overeating. Sleep loss and obesity are tightly linked. Both phenomena have been associated with increased neural activation in regions associated with reward, inhibitory control, and disrupted dopamine signaling. Elevated baseline reward sensitivity in the ventral striatum appears to be further compounded by sleep deprivation induced dysfunction in the reward neurocircuitry, increasing the likelihood of overeating. Our findings suggest that large individual differences in baseline responsiveness of hedonic reward pathways may modulate the association between sleep loss and obesity.","[Satterfield, Brieann C.; Raikes, Adam C.; Killgore, William D.

ToM, or the ""mentalizing"" process, is the ability to attribute mental states, such as emotion, intentions and beliefs, to others to explain and predict their behavior. It is a fundamental aspect of social cognition and crucial for social interactions, together with more automatic mechanisms, such as emotion contagion. Social cognition requires complex interactions between limbic, associative areas and subcortical structures, including the cerebellum. It has been hypothesized that the typical cerebellar role in adaptive control and predictive coding could also be extended to social behavior. The present study aimed to investigate the social cognition abilities of patients with degenerative cerebellar atrophy to understand whether the cerebellum acts in specific ToM components playing a role as predictive structure. To this aim, an ad hoc social cognition battery was administered to 27 patients with degenerative cerebellar pathology and 27 healthy controls. In addition, 3D T1-weighted and resting-state fMRI scans were collected to characterize the structural and functional changes in cerebello-cortical loops. The results evidenced that the patients were impaired in lower-level processes of immediate perception as well as in the more complex conceptual level of mentalization. Furthermore, they presented a pattern of GM reduction in cerebellar portions that are involved in the social domain such as crus I-II, lobule IX and lobule Villa. These areas showed decreased functional connectivity with projection cerebral areas involved in specific aspects of social cognition. These findings boost the idea that the cerebellar modulatory function on the cortical projection areas subtends the social cognition process at different levels. Particularly, regarding the lower-level processes, the cerebellum may act by implicitly matching the external information (i.e., expression of the eyes) with the respective internal representation to guarantee an immediate judgment about the mental state of others. Otherwise, at a more complex conceptual level, the cerebellum seems to be involved in the construction of internal models of mental processes during social interactions in which the prediction of sequential events plays a role, allowing us to anticipate the other person's behavior.","[Clausi, Silvia; Olivito, Giusy; Lupo, Michela; Leggio, Maria] IRCCS Fdn Santa Lucia, Ataxia Lab, Rome, Italy; [Clausi, Silvia; Olivito, Giusy; Leggio, Maria] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Psychol, Rome, Italy; [Olivito, Giusy; Bozzali, Marco] IRCCS Fdn Santa Lucia, Neuroimage Lab, Rome, Italy; [Siciliano, Libera] Sapienza Univ Rome, PhD Program Behav Neurosci, Rome, Italy","Leggio, M (reprint author), IRCCS Fdn Santa Lucia, Ataxia Lab, Rome, Italy.; Leggio, M (reprint author), Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Psychol, Rome, Italy.","maria.leggio@uniroma1.it","","","Italian Ministry of Instruction, University and Research (MIUR) [RM11715C7E67E525]; Italian Ministry of Health [GR-2013-02354888]","The present study was supported by grants from the Italian Ministry of Instruction, University and Research (MIUR) (Grant Number RM11715C7E67E525) to MAL and from the Italian Ministry of Health to SC (Grant Number GR-2013-02354888).","","111","0","0","0","0","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","1662-5102","","","FRONT CELL NEUROSCI","Front.

The theory of predictive coding suggests that the social brain may meet this need by automatically predicting others' social futures. If so, when representing others' current mental state, the brain should already start representing their future states. To test this hypothesis, we used fMRI to measure female and male human participants' neural representations of mental states. Representational similarity analysis revealed that neural patterns associated with mental states currently under consideration resembled patterns of likely future states more so than patterns of unlikely future states. This effect manifested in activity across the social brain network and in medial prefrontal cortex in particular. Repetition suppression analysis also supported the social predictive coding hypothesis: considering mental states presented in predictable sequences reduced activity in the precuneus relative to unpredictable sequences. In addition to demonstrating that the brain makes automatic predictions of others' social futures, the results also demonstrate that the brain leverages a 3D representational space to make these predictions. Proximity between mental states on the psychological dimensions of rationality, social impact, and valence explained much of the association between state-specific neural pattern similarity and state transition likelihood. Together, these findings suggest that the way the brain represents the social present gives people an automatic glimpse of the social future.","[Thornton, Mark A.; Weaverdyck, Miriam E.; Tamir, Diana I.] Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Peretsman Scully Hall, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Thornton, Mark A.; Tamir, Diana I.] Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA","Thornton, MA (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Peretsman Scully Hall, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.","mthornto@princeton.edu","","","National Institutes of Mental Health-National Institutes of Health [R01MH114904]","This work was supported by the National Institutes of Mental Health-National Institutes of Health (Grant R01MH114904 to D.I.T.).

However, it is unclear whether this network is also recruited by comparisons involving the self. Self-reflection engages self-serving motivations (e.g., the maintenance of a positive self-image) and is associated with specific brain structures, such as the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), the anterior insula (AI) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Self-other comparisons may thus rely on distinct neural activity. To clarify this question, we used fMRI and asked female participants to compare their own attractiveness (or the attractiveness of a familiar woman) to pictures of unknown women. Participants were slower for comparisons with targets whose attractiveness was similar to their own (or their familiar other). Yet although this behavioral result resembles the distance effect reported for nonsocial magnitudes, at the brain level, it was linked to the activity of the AI, the ACC and the MPFC. The effect of distance in these regions was stronger for self-other than familiar-other comparisons.

To identify the neural bases associated with such age-related differences, we measured the brain activity of older and younger participants using functional magnetic resonance imaging while they processed feedback on whether their initial trustworthiness impressions of stimulus persons, whose true trustworthiness had been predetermined, were right or wrong. Of special interest was the activation in mentalizing- (e.g., medial prefrontal cortex) and reward-related brain regions (e.g., striatum), which are known to be involved in impression formation and feedback learning, respectively. The reduction in the striatal responses to impression-contradicting versus impression-confirming feedback was greater in older than in younger participants. The activation of some mentalizing-related regions (medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus) was lower in older than younger participants; however, it was not modulated by impression-feedback congruency. The results suggest that age-related differences in the striatum engagement may underlie older adults' inefficiency in learning impression-incongruent information about others' trustworthiness.

We assume many of these to reflect differences as to the sex to which one feels attracted rather than to biological sex per se. Investigating voice perception, a function of high social relevance, we show that the behavioural and neural (BOLD) responses to male and female voices are mediated by sex and sexual orientation. In heterosexual men and women, we found an opposite-sex effect, reflected in higher classification accuracy for and a response bias towards voices of the other sex, while the effect became apparent as same-sex effect in homosexual men and women. Overall, sexual orientation had a greater impact in women than in men and homosexual women were closer to men in their behavioural responses to female voices. The activation patterns were similar for hetero- and homosexual men, both groups showing increased activation in response to male compared to female voices in regions distributed across the temporo-parietal and insular cortex. In contrast, women had increased activation in response to voices of the desired sex. It appears that both sex and sexual orientation impact on a function as basal as voice perception. Our results underline the need to assess sexual orientation in study participants if conclusions on sex differences shall be drawn. Many of the reported sex differences in behaviour and brain function might be mediated by sexual orientation and we encourage further research into the interplay between sex and sexual orientation.","[Smith, Elke; Junger, Jessica; Pauly, Katharina; Kellermann, Thilo; Habel, Ute] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Med Sch, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Pauwelsstr 30, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Junger, Jessica; Pauly, Katharina; Kellermann, Thilo; Habel, Ute] Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH, JARA BRAIN Inst, Brain Struct Funct Relationships, Aachen, Germany; [Junger, Jessica; Pauly, Katharina; Kellermann, Thilo; Habel, Ute] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Aachen, Germany; [Dernt, Birgit] Univ Hosp Tubingen, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Tubingen, Germany","Smith, E (reprint author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Med Sch, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Pauwelsstr 30, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.","esmith@ukaachen.de","Kellermann, Thilo/B-1712-2012","Kellermann, Thilo/0000-0003-4081-5581; /0000-0003-2836-0924; Derntl, Birgit/0000-0003-0133-4486; Habel, Ute/0000-0003-0703-7722","German Research Foundation [DFG HA 3202/7-3]; Brain Imaging Facility of the Interdisciplinary Centre for Clinical Research within the Medical Faculty of the RWTH Aachen University","This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG HA 3202/7-3) and the Brain Imaging Facility of the Interdisciplinary Centre for Clinical Research within the Medical Faculty of the RWTH Aachen University.

Previous neuroimaging and lesion studies identified several components of the brain network for visual biological motion (BM) processing, but interactions among these components and their relationship to behavior remain little understood. Here, using a recently developed integrative analysis of structural and effective connectivity derived from high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we assess the cerebro-cerebellar network for processing of camouflaged point-light BM. Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) informed by probabilistic tractography indicates that the right superior temporal sulcus (STS) serves as an integrator within the temporal module. However, the STS does not appear to be a ""gatekeeper"" in the functional integration of the occipito-temporal and frontal regions: The fusiform gyrus (FFG) and middle temporal cortex (MTC) are also connected to the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and insula, indicating multiple parallel pathways. BM-specific loops of effective connectivity are seen between the left lateral cerebellar lobule Crus I and right STS, as well as between the left Crus I and right insula. The prevalence of a structural pathway between the FFG and STS is associated with better BM detection. Moreover, a canonical variate analysis shows that the visual sensitivity to BM is best predicted by BM-specific effective connectivity from the FFG to STS and from the IFG, insula, and STS to the early visual cortex. Overall, the study characterizes the architecture of the cerebro-cerebellar network for BM processing and offers prospects for assessing the social brain.","[Sokolov, Arseny A.; Ryvlin, Philippe] CHU Vaudois, Dept Neurosci Clin, Serv Neurol, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Sokolov, Arseny A.; Zeidman, Peter; Friston, Karl J.] UCL, Inst Neurol, Wellcome Ctr Human Neuroimaging, London WC1N 3BG, England; [Sokolov, Arseny A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol, Neuroscape Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Erb, Michael] Univ Tubingen, Dept Biomed Magnet Resonance, Med Sch, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Pavlova, Marina A.] Univ Tubingen, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Med Sch, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany","Sokolov, AA (reprint author), CHU Vaudois, Dept Neurosci Clin, Serv Neurol, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland.; Sokolov, AA (reprint author), UCL, Inst Neurol, Wellcome Ctr Human Neuroimaging, London WC1N 3BG, England.; Sokolov, AA (reprint author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol, Neuroscape Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA.","arseny.sokolov@chuv.ch","","Ryvlin, Philippe/0000-0001-7775-6576","Baasch-Medicus Foundation; Leenaards Foundation; Research Committee Fund, Faculty for Biology and Medicine, University of Lausanne, Switzerland; European Academy of Neurology; Wellcome Trust Principal Research Fellowship [088130/Z/09/Z]; Reinhold Beitlich Foundation; BBBank Foundation; German Research Foundation [PA 847/22-1]","We thank Richard S.

A large number of studies have investigated the neural substrates of deception; however, the brain networks contributing to the individual differences in deception remain unclear. In this study, we sought to address this issue by employing a machine-learning approach to predict individuals' deceptive propensity based on the topological properties of whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). Participants finished the resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data acquisition, and then, one week later, participated as proposers in a modified ultimatum game in which they spontaneously chose to be honest or deceptive. A linear relevance vector regression (RVR) model was trained and validated to examine the relationship between topological properties of networks of RSFC and actual deceptive behaviors. The machine-learning model sufficiently decoded individual differences in deception using three brain networks based on RSFC, including the executive controlling network (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, middle frontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex), the social and mentalizing network (the temporal lobe, temporoparietal junction, and inferior parietal lobule), and the reward network (putamen and thalamus). These networks have been found to form a signaling cognitive framework of deception by coding the mental states of others and the reward or values of deception or honesty, and integrating this information to make a final decision about being deceptive or honest. These findings suggest the potential of using RSFC as a task-independent neural trait for predicting deceptive propensity, and shed light on using machine-learning approaches in deception detection.

While these networks undoubtedly support higher cognition, their precise functional characteristics are rarely probed directly. The frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes contain the majority of the tertiary association cortex, which are key substrates for higher cognition including executive function, language, memory, and attention. Accordingly, we established the cognitive signature of a set of contrastive brain networks on the main tertiary association cortices, identified in two task-independent datasets. Using graph-theory analysis, we revealed multiple networks across the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortex, derived from structural and functional connectivity. The patterns of network activity were then investigated using three task-active fMRI datasets to generate the functional profiles of the identified networks. We employed representational dissimilarity analysis on these functional data to quantify and compare the representational characteristics of the networks. Our results demonstrated that the topology of the task-independent networks was strongly associated with the patterns of network activity in the task-active fMRI. Our findings establish a direct relationship between the brain networks identified from task-free datasets and higher cognitive functions including cognitive control, language, memory, visuospatial function, and perception. Not only does this study support the widely held view that higher cognitive functions are supported by widespread, distributed cortical networks, but also it elucidates a methodological approach for formally establishing their relationship.","[Jung, JeYoung; Visser, Maya; Binney, Richard J.; Ralph, Matthew A.

Previous neuroimaging studies have identified a distributed network of brain regions involved in the tactile perception of texture. However, it remains unclear how nodes in this network contribute to the tactile awareness of texture. To examine the hypothesis that such awareness involves the interaction of the primary somatosensory cortex with higher order cortices, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study utilizing the velvet hand illusion, in which an illusory velvet-like surface is perceived between the hands. Healthy participants were subjected to a strong illusion, a weak illusion, and tactile perception of real velvet. The strong illusion induced greater activation in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) than the weak illusion, and increases in such activation were positively correlated with the strength of the illusion. Furthermore, both actual and illusory perception of velvet induced common activation in S1. Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis revealed that the strength of the illusion modulated the functional connectivity of S1 with each of the following regions: the parietal operculum, superior parietal lobule, precentral gyrus, insula, and cerebellum. The present results indicate that S1 is associated with the conscious tactile perception of textures, which may be achieved via interactions with higher order somatosensory areas.","[Rajaei, Nader] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan; [Aoki, Naoya; Sadato, Norihiro] Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Div Cerebral Integrat, Okazaki, Aichi, Japan; [Aoki, Naoya; Sadato, Norihiro] Grad Univ Adv Studies, Hayama, Japan; [Takahashi, Haruka K.] Kao Corp, Odawara, Kanagawa, Japan; [Miyaoka, Tetsu] Shizuoka Inst Sci & Technol, Shizuoka, Japan; [Kochiyama, Takanori] ATR Brain Act Imaging Ctr, Seika, Japan; [Ohka, Masahiro] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Informat Sci, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan; [Kitada, Ryo] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Social Sci, Div Psychol, 14 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 637332, Singapore","Kitada, R (reprint author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Social Sci, Div Psychol, 14 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 637332, Singapore.","ryokitada@ntu.edu.sg","","Sadato, Norihiro/0000-0002-9786-3907; Kitada, Ryo/0000-0001-7446-4033; Kochiyama, Takanori/0000-0002-4023-0674; Takahashi, Haruka/0000-0002-6946-7982","HAYAO NAKAYAMA Foundation for Science & Technology and Culture; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) Japan [KAKENHI 15H01846, KAKENHI 15K13855, KAKENHI 16H01680, KAKENHI 25135734, KAKENHI 25540061, KAKENHI 26244031, KAKENHI 26282164]; Nanyang Technological University","HAYAO NAKAYAMA Foundation for Science & Technology and Culture; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), and Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) Japan, Grant/Award Number: KAKENHI 15H01846 KAKENHI 15K13855 KAKENHI 16H01680 KAKENHI 25135734 KAKENHI 25540061 KAKENHI 26244031 KAKENHI 26282164; Nanyang Technological University, Grant/Award Number: NAP Start up Grant","","74","1","1","2","2","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1065-9471","1097-0193","","HUM BRAIN MAPP","Hum.

Under certain social contexts, however, automatic imitation is not always beneficial, and a complementary action (which appears as a reversal imitation action) is instead required. Past research on this topic mainly focused on passive complementary actions, which were triggered by external actions that are bound by the requirements or meanings of social interaction. The present study investigated the activation of initiative complementary action in the absence of requests for interaction by an agent. Through a motor priming paradigm, it was found that complementary actions arose in a dropping action situation, wherein an object held by an actor was suddenly dropped as it is moved towards the plate. But this was only observed when the actors carried out the action using their left hands. This finding suggests that initiative complementary action can be performed in situations wherein external action does not require to interact with the observer. This supports and extends the idea that complementary actions are highly responsive to social context.","[Zhao, Liang] Baoji Univ Arts & Sci, Sch Educ, Baoji 721000, Peoples R China","Zhao, L (reprint author), Baoji Univ Arts & Sci, Sch Educ, Baoji 721000, Peoples R China.","acefgh123@163.com","","","Scientific Research Foundation for Doctor of Baoji University of Arts and Sciences [ZK16037]","This study was supported by a grant from Programs of Scientific Research Foundation for Doctor (ZK16037) of Baoji University of Arts and Sciences to Liang Zhao.

However, emotion as an important influencing factor on novel word learning has not been fully considered in the previous studies. In addition, the effects of emotion on word learning and the underlying neural mechanism have not been systematically investigated. Sixteen participants were trained to learn novel concrete or abstract words under negative, neutral, and positive contextual emotions over 3 days; then, fMRI scanning was done during the testing sessions on day 1 and day 3. We compared the brain activations in day 1 and day 3 to investigate the role of contextual emotions in learning different types of words and the corresponding neural plasticity changes. Behaviorally, the performance of the words learned in the negative context was lower than those in the neutral and positive contexts, which indicated that contextual emotions had a significant impact on novel word learning. Correspondingly, the functional plasticity changes of the right angular gyrus (AG), bilateral insula, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) induced by word learning were modulated by the contextual emotions. The insula also was sensitive to the concreteness of the learned words. More importantly, the functional plasticity changes of the left inferior frontal gyrus (left IFG) and left fusiform gyrus (left FG) were interactively influenced by the contextual emotions and concreteness, suggesting that the contextual emotional information had a discriminable effect on different types of words in the neural mechanism level. These results demonstrate that emotional information in contexts is inevitably involved in word learning. The role of contextual emotions in brain plasticity for learning is discussed.","[Guo, Jingjing; Li, Dingding; Bi, Yanling] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Key Lab Behav & Cognit Neurosci Shaanxi Prov, Sch Psychol, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Chen, Chunhui] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Cognit Neurosci & Learning, Beijing, Peoples R China","Guo, JJ (reprint author), Shaanxi Normal Univ, Key Lab Behav & Cognit Neurosci Shaanxi Prov, Sch Psychol, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.; Chen, CH (reprint author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Cognit Neurosci & Learning, Beijing, Peoples R China.","guojjok@snnu.edu.cn; chenchunhuichina@bnu.edu.cn","","","Nature Science Foundation of China [31400871, 31571150]; General MOE (Ministry of Education in China) project of Humanities and Social Sciences [18YJA190002]; Major project of medicine science and technology of PLA [AWS17J012]; Open Research Fund of the State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning [CNLYB1409]","This research was supported by grants from the Nature Science Foundation of China (31400871, 31571150), General MOE (Ministry of Education in China) project of Humanities and Social Sciences (18YJA190002), Major project of medicine science and technology of PLA (AWS17J012), and Open Research Fund of the State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning (CNLYB1409).","","94","0","0","4","4","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","1662-5161","","","FRONT HUM NEUROSCI","Front.

Response speed and two key signal detection indices-d'(discrimination sensitivity) and beta (response bias)-converged to indicate that social chemosignals of disgust facilitated food healthiness decisions, in contrast to primary disgust elicitors (disgust odors) that impaired the judgment. fMRI analyses (disgust vs. neutral sweat) revealed that the fusiform face area (FFA), amygdala, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) were engaged in processing social chemosignals of disgust during food judgment. Importantly, a double contrast of social signaling across modalities (olfactory vs. visual-facial expressions) indicated that the FFA and OFC exhibited preferential response to social chemosignals of disgust.

However, it is still unclear whether the activity increase in older adults is also observed in advanced aging. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was designed to clarify the neural correlates of WM in advanced aging. Further, we set out to investigate in the case that adults of advanced age do show age-related increase in WM-related activity, what the functional significance of this over-recruitment might be. Two groups of older adults - ""young-old"" (61-70 years, n = 17) and ""old-old"" (77-82 years, n = 16) - were scanned while performing a visual WM task (the n-back task: 0-back and 1-back). WM effects (1-back > 0-back) common to both age groups were identified in several regions, including the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the inferior parietal cortex, and the insula. Greater WM effects in the old-old than in the young-old group were identified in the right caudal DLPFC. These results were replicated when we performed a separate analysis between two age groups with the same level of WM performance (the young-old vs. a ""high-performing"" subset of the old-old group). There were no regions where WM effects were greater in the young-old group than in the old-old group. Importantly, the magnitude of the over-recruitment WM effects positively correlated with WM performance in the old-old group, but not in the young-old group. The present findings suggest that cortical over-recruitment occurs in advanced old age, and that increased activity may serve a compensatory function in mediating WM performance.","[Suzuki, Maki; Sekiyama, Kaoru] Kumamoto Univ, Fac Letters, Div Cognit Psychol, Kumamoto, Japan; [Suzuki, Maki] Osaka Univ, United Grad Sch Child Dev, Dept Behav Neurol & Neuropsychiat, Suita, Osaka, Japan; [Kawagoe, Toshikazu] Kumamoto Univ, Grad Sch Social & Cultural Sci, Div Human & Social Sci, Kumamoto, Japan; [Nishiguchi, Shu; Yamada, Minoru] Kyoto Univ, Dept Human Hlth Sci, Grad Sch Med, Kyoto, Japan; [Abe, Nobuhito; Otsuka, Yuki; Nakai, Ryusuke; Asano, Kohei; Yoshikawa, Sakiko] Kyoto Univ, Kokoro Res Ctr, Kyoto, Japan; [Sekiyama, Kaoru] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Adv Integrated Studies Human Survivabil, Kyoto, Japan","Suzuki, M (reprint author), Kumamoto Univ, Fac Letters, Div Cognit Psychol, Kumamoto, Japan.; Suzuki, M (reprint author), Osaka Univ, United Grad Sch Child Dev, Dept Behav Neurol & Neuropsychiat, Suita, Osaka, Japan.","msuzuki@psy.med.osaka-u.ac.jp","","","JSPS [25245068, 16H06325, 15K00206]","This research was supported by JSPS Grant Numbers 25245068 and 16H06325 awarded to KS and by JSPS Grant Number 15K00206 awarded to MS.","","81","0","0","1","1","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","1663-4365","","","FRONT AGING NEUROSCI","Front.

At the same time, they are able to select the language they intend to speak and switch back and forth between languages rapidly, with few production errors. Previous research utilizing behavioral (Linck, Kroll, & Sunderman, 2009) and neuroimaging techniques (ERPs and fMRI; Guo, Liu, Misra, & Kroll, 2011; Misra, Guo, Bobb, & Kroll, 2012) suggest that successful bilingual speech production is enabled by active inhibition of the language not in use. Results showing an asymmetric switching cost for the L1 compared to the L2 (with a larger cost-reflected in longer naming latencies-when switching from the L2 to the L1) have been taken as evidence that the L1 (usually the dominant language for bilinguals who learned their second language later in life) may need to be inhibited when speaking in the L2. However, there is still little research on the scope of this inhibitory process. The goal of this event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study is to understand how the recruitment of neural areas implicated during bilingual language processing are shaped by the scope of language use. The results show that bilinguals engage a wide functional control network that is hierarchically engaged in local control for single lexical items, but extends further to the broader semantic level, and finally to the whole language.

Methods: We used data from 20 participants whose task was to plan functional grasps of tools, with either right or left hands. Region of interest and whole-brain searchlight analyses were performed to show task-related neural patterns. Results: MVPA revealed significant contributions to functional grasp planning from the anterior intraparietal sulcus (alPS) and its immediate vicinities, supplemented by inputs from posterior subdivisions of IPS, and the ventral lateral occipital complex (vLOC). Moreover, greater local selectivity was demonstrated in areas near the superior parieto-occipital cortex and dorsal premotor cortex, putatively forming the dorso-dorsal stream. Conclusions: A contribution from alPS, consistent with its role in prospective grasp formation and/or encoding of relevant tool properties (e.g., potential graspable parts), is likely to accompany the retrieval of manipulation and/or mechanical knowledge subserved by the supramarginal gyms for achieving action goals. An involvement of vLOC indicates that MVPA is particularly sensitive to coding of object properties, their identities and even functions, for a support of grip formation. Finally, the engagement of the superior parieto-frontal regions as revealed by MVPA is consistent with their selectivity for transient features of tools (i.e., variable affordances) for anticipatory hand postures. These outcomes support the notion that, compared to traditional approaches, MVPA can reveal more fine-grained patterns of neural activity.","[Buchwald, Mikolaj; Kroliczak, Gregory] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac Social Sci, Act & Cognit Lab, Inst Psychol, Poznan, Poland; [Przybylski, Lukasz] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac Social Sci, Inst Psychol, Sect Log & Cognit Sci, Poznan, Poland","Buchwald, M (reprint author), UAM, Inst Psychol, Ul Szamarzewskiego 89, PL-60568 Poznan, Poland.","mikolaj.buchwald@amu.edu.pl","","Kroliczak, Gregory/0000-0001-6121-0536; Przybylski, Lukasz/0000-0002-1951-2159","National Science Centre (Narodowe Centrum Nauki, NCN) [Maestro 2011/02/A/HS6/00174]; Ministry of Science and Higher Education (Ministerstwo Nauki i Szkolnictwa Wyzszego, MNiSW) [6168/IA/128/2012]; European Regional Development Fund as part of the Innovative Economy Operational Programme, 2007-2013; Maestro grant","The authors declare no conflict of interest.

To examine whether the recruitment of sensorimotor regions during music perception is modulated by instrument-specific experience, we studied nonclassical musicians-beatboxers, who predominantly use their vocal apparatus to produce sound, and guitarists, who use their hands. We contrast fMRI activity in 20 beatboxers, 20 guitarists, and 20 nonmusicians as they listen to novel beatboxing and guitar pieces. All musicians show enhanced activity in sensorimotor regions (IFG, IPC, and SMA), but only when listening to the musical instrument they can play. Using independent component analysis, we find expertise-selective enhancement in sensorimotor networks, which are distinct from changes in attentional networks.

While developmental differences in decision and outcome-related reward processes have been studied extensively, existing paradigms have largely neglected to measure how different types of decisions modulate reward-related outcome processes. We modified an existing decision-making paradigm (the Stoplight Task; Chein et al., 2011) to create a flexible laboratory measure of decision-making and outcome processing, including the ability to assess modulatory effects of safe versus risky decisions on reward-related outcome processes: the Yellow Light Game (YLG).

Results showed that nucleus accumbens activation was enhanced for (1) risky > safe decisions, (2) positive > negative outcomes, and (3) outcomes following safe decisions compared to outcomes following risky decisions, regardless of whether these outcomes were positive or negative. Outcomes following risky decisions (compared to outcomes following safe decisions) were associated with enhanced activity in cortical midline structures. Furthermore, while there were no developmental differences in risk-taking behavior, more pubertally mature adolescents showed enhanced nucleus accumbens activation during positive > negative outcomes. These findings suggest that outcome processing is modulated by the types of decisions made by adolescents and highlight the importance of investigating processes involved in safe as well as risky decisions to better understand the adolescent tendency to take risks.","[de Macks, Zdena A.

In particular, individual differences in the tuning of biological systems that respond to social threats may motivate individuals to seek out differently structured social environments. Drawing on a sample of adolescent males who underwent fMRI brain imaging (n = 74) and contributed Facebook data, we examined whether biological responses to a common scenariobeing excluded from an activity with peers -was associated with their social network structure. We find that neural responses during social exclusion in a priori hypothesized ""social pain"" regions of the brain (dACC, AI, subACC) are associated with the density and transitivity of core friendship networks. These findings suggest that neural reactivity to exclusion may be one factor that underlies network ""safety"".

During the task, participants were asked to open a series of boxes consecutively until they decided to stop. Each box contained a reward (gold), except for one that contained an adverse stimulus (devil), which caused the participants to lose all the gold they collected in that trial. Importantly, participants were instructed that every trial they encountered would also be played in parallel by another player. During the feedback stage, outcomes of both the participant and the other player were presented. Behaviorally, participants felt less regret and took less risk when objective outcomes improved or when their outcomes were better than others. Participants tended to take more risk after experiencing regret. At the neural level, the ventral striatum (VS) and the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) showed increased activation as objective outcomes improved. Across participants, activation of the VS was positively correlated with corresponding behavioral changes. Increased activation of the VS and significantly higher functional connectivity with the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) were found when their outcomes were better than others.

Individual variation in WM has been associated with multiple behavioral and health features including demographic characteristics, cognitive and physical traits and lifestyle choices. In this context, we used sparse canonical correlation analyses (sCCAs) to determine the covariation between brain imaging metrics of WM-network activation and connectivity and nonimaging measures relating to sensorimotor processing, affective and nonaffective cognition, mental health and personality, physical health and lifestyle choices derived from 823 healthy participants derived from the Human Connectome Project. We conducted sCCAs at two levels: a global level, testing the overall association between the entire imaging and behavioral-health data sets; and a modular level, testing associations between subsets of the two data sets. The behavioral-health and neuroimaging data sets showed significant interdependency. Variables with positive correlation to the neuroimaging variate represented higher physical endurance and fluid intelligence as well as better function in multiple higher-order cognitive domains. Negatively correlated variables represented indicators of suboptimal cardiovascular and metabolic control and lifestyle choices such as alcohol and nicotine use. These results underscore the importance of accounting for behavioral-health factors in neuroimaging studies of WM and provide a neuroscience-informed framework for personalized and public health interventions to promote and maintain the integrity of the WM network.","[Moser, D.

The central division of cognitive labor is between two fronto-parietal bilateral networks: (a) the multiple demand (MD) network, which supports executive processes, such as working memory and cognitive control, and is engaged by diverse task domains, including language, especially when comprehension gets difficult; and (b) the default mode network (DMN), which supports introspective processes, such as mind wandering, and is active when we are not engaged in processing external stimuli. These two networks are strongly dissociated in both their functional profiles and their patterns of activity fluctuations during naturalistic cognition. Here, we focus on the functional relationship between these two networks and a third network: (c) the fronto-temporal left-lateralized ""core"" language network, which is selectively recruited by linguistic processing. Is the language network distinct and dissociated from both the MD network and the DMN, or is it synchronized and integrated with one or both of them? Recent work has provided evidence for a dissociation between the language network and the MD network. However, the relationship between the language network and the DMN is less clear, with some evidence for coordinated activity patterns and similar response profiles, perhaps due to the role of both in semantic processing. Here we use a novel fMRI approach to examine the relationship among the three networks: we measure the strength of activations in different language, MD, and DMN regions to functional contrasts typically used to identify each network, and then test which regions co-vary in their contrast effect sizes across 60 individuals. We find that effect sizes correlate strongly within each network (e.g., one language region and another language region, or one DMN region and another DMN region), but show little or no correlation for region pairs across networks (e.g., a language region and a DMN region). Thus, using our novel method, we replicate the language/MD network dissociation discovered previously with other approaches, and also show that the language network is robustly dissociated from the DMN, overall suggesting that these three networks contribute to high-level cognition in different ways and, perhaps, support distinct computations. Inter-individual differences in effect sizes therefore do not simply reflect general differences in vascularization or attention, but exhibit sensitivity to the functional architecture of the brain. The strength of activation in each network can thus be probed separately in studies that attempt to link neural variability to behavioral or genetic variability.","[Mineroff, Zachary; Blank, Idan Asher; Mahowald, Kyle; Fedorenko, Evelina] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Fedorenko, Evelina] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA USA; [Fedorenko, Evelina] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA 02114 USA","Blank, IA; Fedorenko, E (reprint author), MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.","iblank@mit.edu; evelina9@mit.edu","","Mineroff, Zachary/0000-0001-8806-9069","NIH [R00-HD-057522, R01-DC-016607]; Simons Foundation; National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship; Department of Defense (DoD), USA","This work was supported by NIH awards R00-HD-057522 and R01-DC-016607 to E.F., and by a grant from the Simons Foundation to the Simons Center for the Social Brain at MIT.

Specifically, we studied the reorganization, due to deafness and sign language (SL) knowledge, of linguistic and nonlinguistic visual working memory (WM). We conducted an fMRI experiment in groups that differed in their hearing status and SL knowledge: deaf native signers, and hearing native signers, hearing nonsigners. Participants performed a 2-back WM task and a control task. Stimuli were signs from British Sign Language (BSL) or moving nonsense objects in the form of point-light displays. We found characteristic WM activations in fronto-parietal regions in all groups. However, deaf participants also recruited bilateral posterior STC during the WM task, independently of the linguistic content of the stimuli, and showed less activation in fronto-parietal regions. Resting-state connectivity analysis showed increased connectivity between frontal regions and STC in deaf compared to hearing individuals. WM for signs did not elicit differential activations, suggesting that SL WM does not rely on modality-specific linguistic processing. These findings suggest that WM networks are reorganized due to early deafness, and that the organization of cognitive networks is shaped by the nature of the sensory inputs available during development.","[Cardin, Velia; Rudner, Mary; Andin, Josefine; Ronnberg, Jerker] Linkoping Univ, Linnaeus Ctr HEAD, Swedish Inst Disabil Res, Dept Behav Sci & Learning, Linkoping, Sweden; [Cardin, Velia; Beese, Lilli; Woll, Bencie] UCL, Dept Expt Psychol, Deafness Cognit & Language Res Ctr, 49 Gordon Sq, London WC1H 0PD, England; [Cardin, Velia] Univ East Anglia, Sch Psychol, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [De Oliveira, Rita F.] London South Bank Univ, Sch Appl Sci, 103 Borough Rd, London SE1 0AA, England; [Su, Merina T.] UCL GOS Inst Child Hlth, Dev Neurosci Programme, 30 Guilford St, London WC1N 1EH, England","Cardin, V (reprint author), Univ East Anglia, Sch Psychol, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.","velia.cardin@gmail.com","","","Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research [2008-0846]; Swedish Research Council [349-2007-8654]; Economic and Social Research Council of Great Britain [RES-620-28-6001, RES-620-28-0002]","This work was supported by the Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research (2008-0846), the Swedish Research Council (349-2007-8654, Linnaeus Centre HEAD), and by grants from the Economic and Social Research Council of Great Britain (RES-620-28-6001; RES-620-28-0002) to the Deafness Cognition and Language Research Centre.","","59","2","2","5","5","OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1047-3211","1460-2199","","CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

Here, we investigated the contribution of individual genes in the TTC12-ANKK1-DRD2 cluster in smoking and their association with smoking-associated reward processing in adolescence. A meta-analysis of TTC12-ANKK1-DRD2 variants and self-reported smoking behaviours was performed in four European adolescent cohorts (N = 14,084). The minor G-allele of rs2236709, mapping TTC12, was associated with self-reported smoking (p = 5.0 x 10(-4)) and higher plasma cotinine levels (p = 7.0 x 10(-5)). This risk allele was linked to an increased ventral-striatal blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response during reward anticipation (n = 1,263) and with higher DRD2 gene expression in the striatum (p = 0.013), but not with TTC12 or ANKK gene expression. These data suggest a role for the TTC12-ANKK1-DRD2 gene-cluster in adolescent smoking behaviours, provide evidence for the involvement of DRD2 in the early stages of addiction and support the notion that genetically-driven inter-individual differences in dopaminergic transmission mediate reward sensitivity and risk to smoking.

This effect may depend on variability in stress reactivity and past subjective stress. However, as most studies employed between-subjects designs, evidence for within-subject stress effects remains scarce. To understand the role of infra-individual stress effects on WM, we adopted a within-subject design to study how acute stress, variability in stress reactivity, and past subjective stress influence behavioral and neural WM mechanisms. Thirty-four healthy males performed a WM task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a control versus acute stress condition following the Trier Social Stress Test, a validated psychosocial stressor method. We tested for stress effects on WM performance and related neural activation by associating them with individual acute stress responsivity and past subjective stress experience using retrospective self-report questionnaires. We found no evidence of an effect of acute stress or related stress-reactivity on intra-individual WM performance. However, past subjective stress negatively influenced acute stress-induced changes to WM. On the neural level, acute stress reduced WM-related activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). The observed negative influence of inter-individual variability in past subjective stress experience on changes in WM performance, suggests that past subjective stress might induce vulnerability for impairing effects of acute stress on cognitive functioning. Because acute stress reduced WM-related dlPFC activation while WM performance remained unaffected, acute stress might boost neural processing efficiency in this group of high performing healthy individuals. Our study suggests that measures of past subjective stress should be considered when studying and interpreting the effects of acute stress on cognition.","[Luettgau, Lennart] Otto von Guericke Univ, Ctr Behav Brain Sci, Magdeburg, Germany; [Luettgau, Lennart; Schlagenhauf, Florian; Sjoerds, Zsuzsika] Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Dept Neurol, Leipzig, Germany; [Schlagenhauf, Florian] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Schlagenhauf, Florian] Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Schlagenhauf, Florian] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany; [Schlagenhauf, Florian] Berlin Inst Hlth, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy CCM, Berlin, Germany; [Sjoerds, Zsuzsika] Leiden Univ, Inst Psychol, Cognit Psychol Unit, Leiden, Netherlands; [Sjoerds, Zsuzsika] Leiden Univ, Leiden Inst Brain & Cognit, Leiden, Netherlands","Luettgau, L (reprint author), Otto von Guericke Univ, Ctr Behav Brain Sci, Univ Pl 2,G22,R320, D-39106 Magdeburg, Germany.","lennart.luettgau@ovgu.de","","Sjoerds, Zsuzsika/0000-0001-9467-3772","Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [Rubicon 2014/05563/ALW]; Max Planck Society; German Research Foundation [DFG SCHL 1969/2-2, FOR1617, SCHL1969/4-1]","The authors would like to thank all volunteers who participated in this study.

However, most neuroimaging studies of mentalizing have used noninteractive tasks that may fail to capture important aspects of real-world mentalizing. In adults, social-interactive context modulates activity in regions linked to social cognition and reward, but few interactive studies have been done with children. The current fMRI study examines children aged 8-12 using a novel paradigm in which children believed they were interacting online with a peer. We compared mental and non-mental state reasoning about a live partner (Peer) versus a story character (Character), testing the effects of mentalizing and social interaction in a 2 x 2 design. Mental versus Non-Mental reasoning engaged regions identified in prior mentalizing studies, including the temporoparietal junction, superior temporal sulcus, and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Moreover, peer interaction, even in conditions without explicit mentalizing demands, activated many of the same mentalizing regions. Peer interaction also activated areas outside the traditional mentalizing network, including the reward system. Our results demonstrate that social interaction engages multiple neural systems during middle childhood and contribute further evidence that social-interactive paradigms are needed to fully capture how the brain supports social processing in the real world.","[Alkire, Diana; Redcay, Elizabeth] Univ Maryland, Dept Psychol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Alkire, Diana; Redcay, Elizabeth] Univ Maryland, Neurosci & Cognit Sci Program, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Levitas, Daniel] Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Warnell, Katherine Rice] Texas State Univ, Dept Psychol, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA","Alkire, D (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Dept Psychol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.","diana@umd.edu","","","University of Maryland; National Institute of Mental Health [R01-MH107441]","University of Maryland and a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health, Grant/Award Number: R01-MH107441","","61","0","0","5","5","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1065-9471","1097-0193","","HUM BRAIN MAPP","Hum.

Only recently has research in this area investigated motivational contributions to control allocation. An important gap in our understanding is the way in which intrinsic rewards associated with a task motivate the sustained allocation of control. To address this issue, we draw on flow theory, which predicts that a balance between task difficulty and individual ability results in the highest levels of intrinsic reward. In three behavioral and one functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, we used a naturalistic and open-source video game stimulus to show that changes in the balance between task difficulty and an individual's ability to perform the task resulted in different levels of intrinsic reward, which is associated with different brain states. Specifically, psychophysiological interaction analyses show that high levels of intrinsic reward associated with a balance between task difficulty and individual ability are associated with increased functional connectivity between key structures within cognitive control and reward networks. By comparison, a mismatch between task difficulty and individual ability is associated with lower levels of intrinsic reward and corresponds to increased activity within the default mode network. These results suggest that intrinsic reward motivates cognitive control allocation.","[Huskey, Richard] Ohio State Univ, Sch Commun, 3105 Derby Hall,154 North Oval Mall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Craighead, Britney; Weber, Rene] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Commun, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Miller, Michael B.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Huskey, R (reprint author), Ohio State Univ, Sch Commun, 3105 Derby Hall,154 North Oval Mall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.","huskey.29@osu.edu","","Huskey, Richard/0000-0002-4559-2439","University of California Santa Barbara George D.

The purpose of the current study was to identify potential neural substrate mechanisms underlying individual differences in aesthetic engagement and reported proneness to aesthetic chill. Methods: Data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) 1200 Subjects Release were utilized. Resting-state fMRI connectivity was extracted for 361 regions in the brain including cortical, subcortical and cerebellar regions for each participant, using participant-specific segmentation and parcellation of subcortical gray matter nuclei and a network-based statistics analytical approach. The Aesthetic Interests subcluster of the Openness to Experience scale (NEO-Five Factor Inventory; NEO-FFI) was used to characterize individual differences in aesthetic engagement and chill. Results: Participants reporting higher aesthetic engagement, particularly proneness to aesthetic chill responses, exhibited significantly higher connectivity between the default network and sensory and motor cortices, higher connectivity between the ventral default and salience networks, and decreased connectivity between the cerebellum and somatomotor cortex. Conclusions: Current findings suggest that greater integration of the default mode network, involving processing of internal narrative, with neural representations of sensory perception and salience detection may be a mechanism underlying individual differences in aesthetic engagement. Thus, these individual differences may reflect general integration of environmental perception with internal emotional experience, which in turn may facilitate comfort with novelty, self-regulation, and positive adaptation to potentially stressful experiences.","[Williams, Paula G.; Johnson, Kimberley T.; Curtis, Brian J.] Univ Utah, Dept Psychol, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [King, Jace B.; Anderson, Jeffrey S.] Univ Utah, Program Neurosci, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Anderson, Jeffrey S.] Univ Utah, Dept Radiol & Imaging Sci, Salt Lake City, UT USA","Williams, PG (reprint author), Dept Psychol, 380 S 1530 E Beh S 502, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.","paula.williams@psych.utah.edu","","","University of Utah College of Social and Behavioral Sciences Interdisciplinary Research Pilot Program; University of Utah Neuroscience Initiative; University of Utah Global Change and Sustainability Center; National Institute of Mental Health [R01 MH080826]; 16 NIH Institutes and Centers that support the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research [1U54MH091657]; McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience at Washington University","Portions of these data were presented at the 76th annual meeting of the American Psychosomatic Society, Louisville, KY.

A total of 77 adolescents (range = 12-15 years, M-age = 13.45 years, 40 females) completed a computerized driving task during a functional MRI scan. Results showed that adolescents' perceptions of sibling closeness were associated with greater neural activation in the anterior insula, ventral striatum and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex when making safe decisions, suggesting that the quality of sibling relationships modulates adolescent neurocognition even without being present. Furthermore, moderated mediation analyses revealed that higher sibling closeness was associated with lower externalizing behavior via left anterior insula activation during safe decision-making, but only for adolescents without older siblings (i.e. eldest children) compared to adolescents who had multiple older siblings.

In this study, we used fMRI to investigate the neural correlates of interpersonal and brand trust by comparing the brain activation patterns during explicit trustworthiness judgments of faces and brands. Our results showed that while there were several brain areas known to be linked to trustworthiness evaluations, such as the amygdalae, more active in trustworthiness judgments when compared to a control task (familiarity judgment) for faces, no such difference was found for brands. Complementary ROI analysis revealed that the activation of both amygdalae was strongest for faces in the trustworthiness judgments. The direct comparison of the brain activation patterns during the trustworthiness evaluations between faces and brands in this analysis showed that trustworthiness judgments of faces activated the orbitofrontal cortex, another region that was previously linked to interpersonal trust, more strongly than trustworthiness judgments of brands. Further, trustworthiness ratings of faces, but not brands, correlated with activation in the orbitofrontal cortex. Our results indicate that the amygdalae, as well as the orbitofrontal cortex, play a prominent role in interpersonal trust (faces), but not in trust for brands. It is possible that this difference is due to brands being processed as cultural objects rather than as having human-like personality characteristics.","[Javor, Andrija] Kepler Univ Hosp, Dept Neurol 2, Linz, Austria; [Kindermann, Harald] Univ Appl Sci Upper Austria, Steyr, Austria; [Koschutnig, Karl; Ischebeck, Anja] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Dept Psychol, Graz, Austria; [Ischebeck, Anja] BioTechMed, Graz, Austria","Javor, A (reprint author), Kepler Univ Hosp, Dept Neurol 2, Linz, Austria.","javor@gmx.at","","Ischebeck, Anja/0000-0002-3493-2848","University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria","University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria","","55","0","0","5","5","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0953-816X","1460-9568","","EUR J NEUROSCI","Eur.

Specialists of e-commerce have therefore explored the facets of online risk perception with the aim of identifying which has the greatest impact. There is, nonetheless, no consensus as to the facets of risk perception or their relative importance. This is the first study resorting to neurological tools that examines the differences between the three most widespread facets of risk (financial, privacy, and performance) in a low-involvement purchase environment. Contrary to behavioral findings, brain data from neurological analyses identify differences between the three facets of risk. Financial risk conveys the lowest subconscious aversion and negative values. Subconscious privacy risk, in turn, confers ambivalence and uncertainty while performance risk elicits the highest levels of disappointment and distrust. Implications from the current findings, if taken into account by retailers, can greatly improve web contents and purchase processes, and bolster sales.","[Casado-Aranda, Luis-Alberto; Sanchez-Fernandez, Juan; Montoro-Rios, Francisco J.] Univ Granada, Dept Mkt & Market Res, Campus Univ Cartuja, Granada 18011, Spain","Casado-Aranda, LA (reprint author), Univ Granada, Dept Mkt & Market Res, Campus Univ Cartuja, Granada 18011, Spain.","lcasado@ugr.es","","","Excellence Project - Junta de Andalusia [P12-SEJ-1980]; FPU - Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports of Spain [FPU14/04736]","This study was supported by an Excellence Project awarded by the Junta de Andalusia [REF: P12-SEJ-1980] and a FPU contract awarded by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports of Spain.

While neural representations of speech categories have been previously identified in frontal and posterior temporal-parietal regions, the task dependency and dimensional specificity of these neural representations are still unclear. Here, we asked native Mandarin participants to listen to speech syllables carrying 4 distinct lexical tone categories across passive listening, repetition, and categorization tasks while they underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We used searchlight classification and representational similarity analysis (RSA) to identify the dimensional structure underlying neural representation across tasks and surface-acoustic properties. Searchlight classification analyses revealed significant ""cross-task"" lexical tone decoding within the bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG) and left inferior parietal lobule (LIPL). RSA revealed that the LIPL and LSTG, in contrast to the RSTG, relate to 2 critical dimensions (pitch height, pitch direction) underlying tone perception. Outside this core representational network, we found greater activation in the inferior frontal and parietal regions for stimuli that are more perceptually similar during tone categorization. Our findings reveal the specific characteristics of fronto-tempo-parietal regions that support speech representation and categorization processing.","[Feng, Gangyi; Wong, Patrick C.

Extending our prior work to examine the influence of alcoholism risk factors, we paired abstract visual stimuli with intravenous alcohol delivered covertly and examined brain responses to these Pavlovian-conditioned stimuli in fMRI when subjects were not intoxicated. Sixty healthy drinkers performed task-irrelevant alcohol conditioning that presented geometric shapes as conditioned stimuli. Shapes were paired with a rapidly rising alcohol limb (conditioned stimulus; CS+) using intravenous alcohol infusion targeting a final peak breath alcohol concentration of 0.045 g/dL or saline (CS-) infusion at matched rates. On day 2, subjects performed monetary delay discounting outside the scanner to assess delay tolerance and then underwent event-related fMRI while performing the same task with CS+, CS-, and an irrelevant symbol. CS+ elicited stronger activation than CS- in frontoparietal executive/attention and orbitofrontal reward-associated networks. Risk factors including family history, recent drinking, sex, and age of drinking onset did not relate to the [CS+ > CS-] activation. Delay-tolerant choice and [CS+ > CS-] activation in right inferior parietal cortex were positively related. Networks governing executive attention and reward showed enhanced responses to stimuli experimentally paired with intoxication, with the right parietal cortex implicated in both alcohol cue pairing and intertemporal choice. While different from our previous study results in 14 men, we believe this paradigm in a large sample of male and female drinkers offers novel insights into Pavlovian processes less affected by idiosyncratic drug associations.","[Oberlin, Brandon G.; Plawecki, Martin H.; O'Connor, Sean J.; Kareken, David A.] Indiana Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, 355 W 16th St GH 4800, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Oberlin, Brandon G.; Dzemidzic, Mario; Eiler, William J.

Despite a surge of interest in examining behavioral characteristics of narcissism in the past decades, the neurobiological substrates underlying narcissism remain poorly understood. Here, we addressed this issue by applying a machine learning approach to decode trait narcissism from whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). Resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data were acquired for a large sample comprising 155 healthy adults, each of whom was assessed for trait narcissism. Using a linear prediction model, we examined the relationship between whole-brain RSFC and trait narcissism. We demonstrated that the machine-learning model was able to decode individual trait narcissism from RSFC across multiple neural systems, including functional connectivity between and within limbic and prefrontal systems as well as their connectivity with other networks. Key nodes that contributed to the prediction model included the amygdala, prefrontal and anterior cingulate regions that have been linked to trait narcissism. These findings remained robust using different validation procedures. Our findings thus demonstrate that RSFC among multiple neural systems predicts trait narcissism at the individual level.","[Feng, Chunliang; Wu, Xia] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Feng, Chunliang] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Cognit Neurosci & Learning, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Feng, Chunliang; Luo, Yuejia] Shenzhen Univ, Shenzhen Key Lab Affect & Social Cognit Sci, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Jie] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Psychol, State Key Lab Brain & Cognit Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Jie] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Dept Psychol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Gu, Ruolei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Psychol, Key Lab Behav Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Gu, Ruolei] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Dept Psychol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Hui] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Psychol, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Luo, Yuejia] Shenzhen Inst Neurosci, Ctr Emot & Brain, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Luo, Yuejia] Southern Med Univ, Dept Psychol, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Wu, X (reprint author), Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Luo, YJ (reprint author), Shenzhen Univ, Inst Affect & Social Neurosci, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.","wuxia@bnu.edu.cn; luoyj@szu.edu.cn","","","National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents [BX201600019, BX201600187]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017M610055]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31500920, 31571124, 61571047]; Foundation of the National Key Laboratory of Human Factors Engineering [HF2012-K-03]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2017EYT36]","National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents, Grant/Award Numbers: BX201600019 and BX201600187; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 2017M610055; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 31500920, 31571124, and 61571047; Foundation of the National Key Laboratory of Human Factors Engineering, Grant/Award Number: HF2012-K-03; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Grant/Award Number: 2017EYT36","","106","1","1","9","12","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1065-9471","1097-0193","","HUM BRAIN MAPP","Hum.

The additional eye-tracking experiment showed that participants spent more time viewing the portrait's eyes and mouth when the portrait's gaze was directed towards the observer. These results suggest that static and, in some cases, highly stylized depictions of human beings in artistic portraits elicit brain activation commensurate with the experience of being observed by a watchful intelligent being. They thus involve observers in implicit inferences of the painted subject's mental states and emotions.

Importantly, this neural mirroring is not constant; rather, it is modulated by our beliefs about their intentions, circumstances, and group allegiances. We investigated if the neural empathic response is modulated by minimally-differentiating information (e.g., a simple text label indicating another's religious belief), and if neural activity changes predict ingroups and outgroups across independent paradigms. We found that the empathic response was larger when participants viewed a painful event occurring to a hand labeled with their own religion (ingroup) than to a hand labeled with a different religion (outgroup). Counterintuitively, the magnitude of this bias correlated positively with the magnitude of participants' self-reported empathy. A multivariate classifier, using mean activity in empathy-related brain regions as features, discriminated ingroup from outgroup with 72% accuracy; the classifier's confidence correlated with belief certainty. This classifier generalized successfully to validation experiments in which the ingroup condition was based on an arbitrary group assignment. Empathy networks thus allow for the classification of long-held, newly-modified and arbitrarily-formed ingroups and outgroups. This is the first report of a single machine learning model on neural activation that generalizes to multiple representations of ingroup and outgroup. The current findings may prove useful as an objective diagnostic tool to measure the magnitude of one's group affiliations, and the effectiveness of interventions to reduce ingroup biases.","[Vaughn, Don A.; Cohen, Mark S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Semel Inst Neurosci & Human Behav, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Vaughn, Don A.] Santa Clara Univ, Dept Psychol, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA; [Savjani, Ricky R.] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX USA; [Eagleman, David M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Eagleman, DM (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.","davideagleman@stanford.edu","","","DARPA grant [N11AP20029]; NIH [T90 DA023422]; UCLA Collaboratory","We acknowledge DARPA grant N11AP20029; NIH T90 DA023422; and the UCLA Collaboratory, directed by Matteo Pellegrini, for a QCB Collaboratory Postdoctoral Fellowship.

This heterogeneity has been associated with differences in brain activity, but only in laboratory settings using constrained behaviours. However, it is important to understand how these measures transfer to real life conditions, because the willingness to invest in riskier assets has a direct and considerable effect on long-term wealth accumulation. In a large fMRI study of 157 working age men (39.0 +/- 6.4 SD years), we first show that activity in the anterior insula during the assessment of risky vs. safe choices in an investing task is associated with self-reported real-life active stock trading. We then show that this association remains intact when we control for financial constraints, education, the understanding of financial matters, and cognitive abilities. Finally, we use comprehensive measures of preferences and beliefs about risk taking to show that these two channels mediate the association between brain activation in the anterior insula and real-life active stock trading.","[Haeusler, Alexander N.; Weber, Bernd] Univ Bonn, Ctr Econ & Neurosci, Nachtigallenweg 86, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Haeusler, Alexander N.; Weber, Bernd] Univ Hosp Bonn, Dept Epileptol, Sigmund Freud Str 25, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Haeusler, Alexander N.; Weber, Bernd] Life& Brain Res Ctr, Dept NeuroCognit Imaging, Sigmund Freud Str 25, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Kuhnen, Camelia M.] Univ N Carolina, Kenan Flagler Business Sch, 300 Kenan Ctr Dr, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Rudorf, Sarah] Univ Bern, Inst Psychol, Dept Social Psychol & Social Neurosci, Fabrikstr 8, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland","Hausler, AN (reprint author), Univ Bonn, Ctr Econ & Neurosci, Nachtigallenweg 86, D-53127 Bonn, Germany.; Hausler, AN (reprint author), Univ Hosp Bonn, Dept Epileptol, Sigmund Freud Str 25, D-53127 Bonn, Germany.; Hausler, AN (reprint author), Life& Brain Res Ctr, Dept NeuroCognit Imaging, Sigmund Freud Str 25, D-53127 Bonn, Germany.","anh@uni-bonn.de","Weber, Bernd/H-5244-2012","Weber, Bernd/0000-0002-7811-9605; Hausler, Dr. Alexander Niklas/0000-0003-3506-7566; Rudorf, Sarah/0000-0002-3274-945X","Frankfurt Institute for Risk Management and Regulation (FIRM); Heisenberg Grant of the German Research Foundation ((Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)) [WE 4427(3-2)]","The authors would like to thank (in alphabetical order) Marcel Bartling, Ulrike Broicher, Laura Ehrmantraut, Andreas Forstner, Holger Gerhardt, Yang Hu, Brian Knutson, Josiah Leong, Guido Luchters, Anna Maaser, Tara Madhyastha, Bettina Mahlow, Stephanie Mentges, Markus Nothen, Sergio Oroz-Artigas, Hilke Plassmann, Karolina Raczka, Laura Schinabeck, Matthias Schmid, Paulius Simanavicius, Peter Trautner, Ayaka Tsuchiya, Leonie Weinhold, and Lijun Yin for their support and help.

Interference from concurrently performed cognitive tasks supports this notion, and the lateral prefrontal cortex (IPFC) has been suggested to play a prominent role in the processing of purely cognitive as well as cognitive-postural dual tasks. The degree of cognitive-motor interference varies greatly between individuals, but it is unresolved whether individual differences in the recruitment of specific lPFC regions during cognitive dual tasking are associated with individual differences in cognitive-motor interference. Here, we investigated inter-individual variability in a cognitive-postural multitasking situation in healthy young adults (n = 29) in order to relate these to inter-individual variability in IPFC recruitment during cognitive multitasking. For this purpose, a oneback working memory task was performed either as single task or as dual task in order to vary cognitive load. Participants performed these cognitive single and dual tasks either during upright stance on a balance pad that was placed on top of a force plate or during fMRI measurement with little to no postural demands. We hypothesized dual one-back task performance to be associated with IPFC recruitment when compared to single one-back task performance. In addition, we expected individual variability in IPFC recruitment to be associated with postural performance costs during concurrent dual one-back performance. As expected, behavioral performance costs in postural sway during dual-one back performance largely varied between individuals and so did IPFC recruitment during dual one-back performance. Most importantly, individuals who recruited the right mid-IPFC to a larger degree during dual one-back performance also showed greater postural sway as measured by larger performance costs in total center of pressure displacements. This effect was selective to the high-load dual one-back task and suggests a crucial role of the right lPFC in allocating resources during cognitivemotor interference. Our study provides further insight into the mechanisms underlying cognitive-motor multitasking and its impairments.","[Stelzel, Christine; Bohle, Hannah; Rapp, Michael A.; Heinzel, Stephan] Univ Potsdam, Div Social & Prevent Med, Potsdam, Germany; [Stelzel, Christine; Bohle, Hannah] Int Psychoanalyt Univ, Expt Psychol, Berlin, Germany; [Schauenburg, Gesche; Granacher, Urs] Univ Potsdam, Div Training & Movement Sci, Potsdam, Germany; [Walter, Henrik] Humboldt Univ, Free Univ Berlin, Charite Berlin Univ Med, Berlin Inst Hlth, Berlin, Germany; [Walter, Henrik] Charite Berlin Univ Med, Berlin Ctr Adv Neuroimaging, Berlin, Germany; [Heinzel, Stephan] Free Univ Berlin, Clin Psychol & Psychotherapy, Berlin, Germany","Stelzel, C (reprint author), Univ Potsdam, Div Social & Prevent Med, Potsdam, Germany.; Stelzel, C (reprint author), Int Psychoanalyt Univ, Expt Psychol, Berlin, Germany.","christine.stelzel@ipu-berlin.de","","","German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG) [SPP 1772, GR 3997/4-1, HE 7464/1-1, RA 1047/4-1]; University of Potsdam","This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, priority program SPP 1772: grants GR 3997/4-1, HE 7464/1-1, and RA 1047/4-1).

Participants viewed images of violence in both football and non-football settings while high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired from their brains. Neurological activation was compared between these violence types and between groups. Fans of football show diminished activation in brain regions involved in pain perception and empathy such as the anterior cingulate cortex, fusiform gyrus, insula, and temporal pole when viewing violence in the context of football compared to more broadly violent images. Non-fans of football showed no such effect for the types of violent imagery and had higher activation levels than fans of football for the specified brain regions. These differences show that fans of football may perceive violence differently when it is in the context of football. These fan attitudes have potential policy implications for addressing the issue of concussions in North American football.","[Daniel, Thomas A.; Wang, Yun; Katz, Jeffrey S.; Deshpande, Gopikrishna] Auburn Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, AU MRI Res Ctr, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Daniel, Thomas A.] Westfield State Univ, Dept Psychol, Westfield, MA 01086 USA; [Daniel, Thomas A.; Katz, Jeffrey S.; Deshpande, Gopikrishna] Auburn Univ, Dept Psychol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Townsend, Kyle M.] Georgia State Univ, Robinson Coll Business, Cecil B Day Sch Hospitality Adm, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Wang, Yun] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychiat, New York, NY USA; [Martin, David S.] Auburn Univ, Dept Nutr Dietet & Hospitality Management, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Katz, Jeffrey S.; Deshpande, Gopikrishna] Auburn Univ, Ctr Neurosci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Deshpande, Gopikrishna] Auburn Univ, Ctr Hlth Ecol & Equ Res, Auburn, AL 36849 USA","Deshpande, G (reprint author), Auburn Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, AU MRI Res Ctr, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.; Deshpande, G (reprint author), Auburn Univ, Dept Psychol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.; Deshpande, G (reprint author), Auburn Univ, Ctr Neurosci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.; Deshpande, G (reprint author), Auburn Univ, Ctr Hlth Ecol & Equ Res, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.","gopi@auburn.edu","","","Office of the Vice President for Research at Auburn University","The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Office of the Vice President for Research at Auburn University for this study.","","47","0","0","7","7","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","2296-2565","","","FRONT PUBLIC HEALTH","Front.

This fMRI multivariate analysis used partial least squares analysis to examine the distributed neural processing of race and a relevant but ostensibly nonracial attribute (i.e., socioeconomic status) as a function of the perceiver's external motivation. Sixty-one white male participants (Homo sapiens) privately formed impressions of black and white male faces ascribed with high or low status. Across all conditions, greater external motivation was associated with reduced coactivation of brain regions believed to support emotion regulation (rostral anterior cingulate cortex), introspection (middle cingulate), and social cognition (temporal pole, medial prefrontal cortex). The reduced involvement of this network irrespective of target race and status suggests that external motivation is related to the participant's overall approach to impression formation in an interracial context. The findings highlight the importance of examining network coactivation in understanding the role of external motivation in impression formation, among other interracial social processes.","[Mattan, Bradley D.; Kubota, Jennifer T.; Dang, Tzipporah P.; Cloutier, Jasmin] Univ Delaware, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, 108 Wolf Hall, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Kubota, Jennifer T.] Univ Delaware, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Li, Tianyi] Univ Illinois, Coll Business Adm, Chicago, IL 60607 USA","Cloutier, J (reprint author), Univ Delaware, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, 108 Wolf Hall, Newark, DE 19716 USA.","jcloutier@psych.udel.edu","","","National Institutes of Health [1S10-OD-018448-01]","The authors declare no competing financial interests.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging we examined a total of N = 34 participants while they observed social integrity threats of a misfortunate other and either reported on their schadenfreude or fremdscham. In this between-subject design, we found that despite a broad overlap in brain regions involved in social cognition, the left anterior insula (AI) was activated less if observers were asked to focus on their schadenfreude. Further, the nucleus accumben's activity exclusively covaried with the intensity of the schadenfreude experience and had a higher functional connectivity with the left AI in the context of schadenfreude than during fremdscham. With the present findings, we demonstrate that the valence and intensity of interpersonal emotions strongly depend on the experimental context and that empathy and reward circuits are involved in shaping the subjective experience.","[Paulus, Frieder M.; Mueller-Pinzler, Laura; Stolz, David S.; Mayer, Annalina, V; Rademacher, Lena; Krach, Soeren] Univ Lubeck, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Social Neurosci Lab, Ratzeburger Allee 160, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany; [Mueller-Pinzler, Laura] Royal Netherlands Acad Arts & Sci, Netherlands Inst Neurosci, Social Brain Lab, NL-1105 BA Amsterdam, Netherlands","Krach, S (reprint author), Univ Lubeck, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Social Neurosci Lab, Ratzeburger Allee 160, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany.","paulus@snl.uni-luebeck.de; mueller-pinzler@snl.uni-luebeck.de; stolz@snl.uni-luebeck.de; mayer@snl.uni-luebeck.de; rademacher@snl.uni-luebeck.de; krach@snl.uni-luebeck.de","","","German Research Foundation (DFG) [KR3803/7-1]; von Behring-Rontgen-Stiftung [KR 60-0023]","Research leading to this publication has been funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG; KR3803/7-1) and the von Behring-Rontgen-Stiftung (KR 60-0023).

Healthy participants reported their pain sensitivity before receiving exclusion or inclusion feedback in an online chat. Participants were then randomly assigned to have access to their attachment figure or a stranger and had pain sensitivity measured again. As predicted, excluded participants who had access to their attachment figure evidenced heightened pain sensitivity (lower pain threshold and tolerance), whereas those who sat with a stranger evidenced some degree of a decrease in pain sensitivity (higher pain tolerance).

Attention affects early visual processing. Neuroimaging studies dealing with such processes have thus far concentrated on striate and extrastriate areas. Here, we investigated whether attention orienting or reorienting modulate activity in visually driven TPJ subregions. For each observer we identified 3 visually responsive subregions within TPJ: 2 bilateral (vTPJ(ant) and vTPJ(post)) and 1 right lateralized (vTPJ(cent)). Cortical activity in these subregions was measured using fMRI while observers performed a 2-alternative forced-choice orientation discrimination task. Covert spatial endogenous (voluntary) or exogenous (involuntary) attention was manipulated using either a central or a peripheral cue with task, stimuli and observers constant. Both endogenous and exogenous attention increased activity for invalidly cued trials in right vTPJ(post); only endogenous attention increased activity for invalidly cued trials in left vTPJ(post) and in right vTPJ(cent); and neither type of attention modulated either right or left vTPJ(ant). These results demonstrate that vTPJ(post) and vTPJ(cent) mediate the reorientation of covert attention to task relevant stimuli, thus playing a critical role in visual attention. These findings reveal a differential reorienting cortical response after observers' attention has been oriented to a given location voluntarily or involuntarily.","NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10003 USA; NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA","Dugue, L (reprint author), 6 Washington Pl,9th Floor, New York, NY 10003 USA.","laura.dugue@nyu.edu","","","National Institutes of Health (NIH) [RO1-EY019693, RO1-EY016200]; Fyssen Foundation; Center for Brain Imaging of New York University","National Institutes of Health (NIH) RO1-EY019693 to M.C. and D.J.H.; NIH RO1-EY016200 to M.C.; the Fyssen Foundation to L.D.; and the Center for Brain Imaging of New York University.","","114","5","6","1","1","OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1047-3211","1460-2199","","CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

However, little is known about the neurocomputational mechanisms of deterministic sequential prediction, as prior work has primarily focused on stochastic transition structures. Here we find that human subjects' beliefs about a sequence of states, captured by reaction times, are well explained by a Bayesian pattern-learning model that tracks beliefs about both the current state and the underlying structure of the environment, taking into account prior beliefs about possible patterns in the sequence. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we find distinct neural signatures of uncertainty computations on both levels.

We present a study aimed at identifying neural structures that are sensitive to changes in both task load and fatigue-induced state load. Sixteen healthy participants performed an n-back task before and after a fatigue-inducing day in a helicopter simulator or a free day. Subjective mental effort ratings showed an interaction of the effects of both task and state load changes, with a reduced effect of task load during the fatigued state. Testing for the same interaction effect in a whole-brain functional MRI data, we found a left-lateralized group of clusters in aIC, the anterior cingulate cortex, the dorsal striatum and frontal eye field and M1. We discuss the possible role of these areas and also the relevance of our findings in the light of the proposed opportunity cost model of mental effort.","[Otto, Tobias; Zijlstra, Fred R.

Healthy male college students were asked to complete a Tetris-like task requiring mental rotation skills under individual, cooperative, and competitive contexts in an fMRI scanner. While the participants completed the task, pictures of others experiencing pain evoking emotional empathy randomly appeared to capture contextual effects on empathic neural responses. Behavioral results indicated that, in the presence of cooperation, participants solved the tasks more accurately and quickly than what they did when in the presence of competition. The fMRI results revealed activations in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dIPFC) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) related to executive functions and theory of mind when participants performed the task under both cooperative and competitive contexts, whereas no activation of such areas was observed in the individual context. Cooperation condition exhibited stronger neural responses in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and dmPFC than competition condition. Competition condition, however, showed marginal neural responses in the cerebellum and anterior insular cortex (AIC). The two social contexts involved stronger empathic neural responses to other's pain than the individual context, but no substantial differences between cooperation and competition were present. Regions of interest analyses revealed that individual's trait empathy modulated the neural activity in the state empathy network, the AIC, and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) depending on the social context. These results suggest that cooperation improves task performance and activates neural responses associated with reward and mentalizing. Furthermore, the interaction between trait- and state-empathy was explored by correlation analyses between individual's trait empathy score and changing empathic brain activations along with the exposure to the cooperative and competitive social contexts.","[Lee, Minhye; Kim, Sung-il] Korea Univ, bMRI, Dept Educ, Seoul, South Korea; [Ahn, Hyun Seon] Inha Univ, Ctr Teaching Learning & Technol, Incheon, South Korea; [Kwon, Soon Koo] Dankook Univ, Educ Performance Evaluat Ctr, Yongin, South Korea","Kim, SI (reprint author), Korea Univ, bMRI, Dept Educ, Seoul, South Korea.","sungkim@korea.ac.kr","","","National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A5B8060944]; Korea University Grant","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2014S1A5B8060944) and Korea University Grant.","","85","1","1","4","4","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","1662-5161","","","FRONT HUM NEUROSCI","Front.

To further examine its neural implementation and underlying computations, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging together with computational modeling. In a modified PIF paradigm, participants first received a monetary split (i.e. greedy, equal or generous) from either a human partner or a computer. They then chose between two options involving additional amounts of money to be allocated between themselves and an uninvolved person. Behaviorally, people forward the previously received greed/generosity towards a third person. The social impact of previous treatments is integrated into computational signals in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the right temporoparietal junction during subsequent decision making.

Mindfulness-defined here as a mental state of receptive attentiveness to internal and external stimuli as they arise, moment-to-moment-may buffer such social distress. However, little research indicates whether mindful individuals adaptively regulate the distress of rejection-or the neural mechanisms underlying this potential capacity. To fill these gaps in the literature, participants reported their trait mindfulness and then completed a social rejection paradigm (Cyberball) while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Approximately 1 hour after the rejection incident, participants reported their level of distress during rejection (i.e. social distress). Mindfulness was associated with less distress during rejection. This relation was mediated by lower activation in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during the rejection incident, a brain region reliably associated with the inhibition of negative affect. Mindfulness was also correlated with less functional connectivity between the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the bilateral amygdala and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, which play a critical role in the generation of social distress. Mindfulness may relate to effective coping with rejection by not over-activating top-down regulatory mechanisms, potentially resulting in more effective long-termemotion-regulation.","[Martelli, Alexandra M.; Chester, David S.; Brown, Kirk Warren] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Psychol, 806 W Franklin St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Eisenberger, Naomi I.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [DeWall, C.

This phenomenon is referred to as other-race effect (ORE). Existing behavioral evidence suggests that one of the possible causes of ORE is that own-race faces are processed more holistically than other-race faces. However, little is known about whether such differences in processing also produce distinctive neural responses in the cortical face processing network. To bridge this gap, the present study used fMRI methodology and the composite face paradigm to examine the response patterns of the traditional face-preferential cortical areas (i.e., the bilateral fusiform face areas [FFA] and the bilateral occipital face areas [OFA]) elicited by own-race faces and other-race faces. We found that the right FFA exhibited a neural composite face effect only for own-race faces but not for other-race faces, even with the absence of the race-related difference in behavior composite face effect. These findings suggest that the right FFA plays a greater role in holistic processing of individual own-race faces than other-race faces. They also suggest that the neural composite effect observed in the right FFA is not the exact neural counterpart of the behavioral face composite effect. The findings of the present study revealed that, along the pathway of the bottom-up face processing, own-race faces and other-race faces presented the holistic processing difference as early as when they were processed in the right FFA.","[Zhou, Guifei; Liu, Jiangang] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Naiqi G.] Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Wu, Si Jia; Lee, Kang] Univ Toronto, Dr Eric Jackman Inst Child Study, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Li, Hong] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Psychol & Sociol, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Li, Hong] Shenzhen Inst Neurosci, Ctr Language & Brain, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Li, Hong] Shenzhen Univ, Shenzhen Key Lab Affect & Social Cognit Sci, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Lee, Kang] Zhejiang Normal Univ, Dept Psychol, Jinhua, Peoples R China","Liu, JG (reprint author), Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Lee, K (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Dr Eric Jackman Inst Child Study, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Li, H (reprint author), Shenzhen Univ, Coll Psychol & Sociol, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.; Li, H (reprint author), Shenzhen Inst Neurosci, Ctr Language & Brain, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.; Li, H (reprint author), Shenzhen Univ, Shenzhen Key Lab Affect & Social Cognit Sci, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.; Lee, K (reprint author), Zhejiang Normal Univ, Dept Psychol, Jinhua, Peoples R China.","liujg@bjtu.edu.cn; lihongszu@szu.edu.cn; kang.lee@utoronto.ca","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61375110, 61673051, 31470993]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2015JBM031]; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01HD046526]","This article is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61375110, 61673051, 31470993, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2015JBM031), and National Institutes of Health (NIH; R01HD046526).","","37","0","0","9","9","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","1662-5161","","","FRONT HUM NEUROSCI","Front.

Thus, brain areas associated with the processing of numbers (i.e., absolute magnitude) were activated during processing symbolic fractions as well as non-symbolic proportions. Here, we investigated systematically the cognitive processing of symbolic (e.g., fractions and decimals) and non-symbolic proportions (e.g., dot patterns and pie charts) in a two-stage procedure. First, we investigated relative magnitude-related activations of proportion processing. Second, we evaluated whether symbolic and non-symbolic proportions share common neural substrates. Methods: We conducted an fMRI study using magnitude comparison tasks with symbolic and non-symbolic proportions, respectively. As an indicator for magnitude-related processing of proportions, the distance effect was evaluated. Results: A conjunction analysis indicated joint activation of specific occipito-parietal areas including right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) during proportion magnitude processing. More specifically, results indicate that the IPS, which is commonly associated with absolute magnitude processing, is involved in processing relative magnitude information as well, irrespective of symbolic or non-symbolic presentation format. However, we also found distinct activation patterns for the magnitude processing of the different presentation formats. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that processing for the separate presentation formats is not only associated with magnitude manipulations in the IPS, but also increasing demands on executive functions and strategy use associated with frontal brain regions as well as visual attention and encoding in occipital regions. Thus, the magnitude processing of proportions may not exclusively reflect processing of number magnitude information but also rather domain-general processes.","[Mock, Julia; Huber, Stefan; Bloechle, Johannes; Dietrich, Julia F.; Bahnmueller, Julia; Rennig, Johannes; Klein, Elise; Moeller, Korbinian] Leibniz Inst Wissensmedien, Schleichstr 6, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Bloechle, Johannes; Rennig, Johannes] Hertie Inst Clin Brain Res, Div Neuropsychol, Otfried Muller Str 27, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Dietrich, Julia F.; Moeller, Korbinian] Eberhardt Karls Univ Tuebingen, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany","Mock, J (reprint author), Leibniz Inst Wissensmedien, Schleichstr 6, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.","j.mock@iwm-tuebingen.de","","","German Research Foundation (DFG) [CR-110/8-1, MO 2525/2-1]; Leibniz-Competition Fund; Margarete von Wrangell fellowship from the Ministry of Science, Research; Arts Baden-Wurttemberg; European Social Fund (ESF); LEAD Graduate School [GSC1028]","JM was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG; CR-110/8-1).

Neuroimaging studies typically seek to isolate one specific aspect of social cognition when trying to map its neural substrates. It is unclear if brain activation elicited by different social cognitive processes and task instructions are also spontaneously elicited by general social information. In this study, we investigated whether these brain regions are evoked by the mere presence of social information using an automated meta-analysis and confirmatory data from an independent study of simple appraisal of social vs. non-social images. Results of 1,000 published fMRI studies containing the keyword of ""social"" were subject to an automated meta-analysis (http://neurosynth.org). To confirm that significant brain regions in the meta-analysis were driven by a social effect, these brain regions were used as regions of interest (ROIs) to extract and compare BOLD fMRI signals of social vs. non-social conditions in the independent study. The NeuroSynth results indicated that the dorsal and ventral medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, bilateral amygdala, bilateral occipito-temporal junction, right fusiform gyrus, bilateral temporal pole, and right inferior frontal gyrus are commonly engaged in studies with a prominent social element. The social-non-social contrast in the independent study showed a strong resemblance to the NeuroSynth map.

To get the most of OSNs, analysts need to identify influential users that can be leveraged for promoting products, distributing messages, or improving the image of companies. In this report we propose a new unsupervised method, Massive Unsupervised Outlier Detection (MUOD), based on outliers detection, for providing support in the identification of influential users. MUOD is scalable, and can hence be used in large OSNs. Moreover, it labels the outliers as of shape, magnitude, or amplitude, depending of their features. This allows classifying the outlier users in multiple different classes, which are likely to include different types of influential users. Applying MUOD to a subset of roughly 400 million Google+ users, it has allowed identifying and discriminating automatically sets of outlier users, which present features associated to different definitions of influential users, like capacity to attract engagement, capacity to attract a large number of followers, or high infection capacity.","[Azcorra, A.; Chiroque, L.

However, the neuroplasticity induced by training is poorly understood. In the present study, native English speakers were trained on non-native pitch patterns (linguistic tones from Mandarin Chinese) in multi-talker (N = 16) or single-talker (N = 16) training conditions. We focused on two aspects of multi-talker training, voice processing and lexical phonology accessing, and used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the brain activation and functional connectivity (FC) of two regions of interest in a tone identification task conducted before and after training, namely the anterior part of the right superior temporal gyrus (aRSTG) and the posterior left superior temporal gyrus (pLSTG). The results showed distinct patterns of associations between neural signals and learning success for multi-talker training. Specifically, post-training brain activation in the aRSTG and FC strength between the aRSTG and pLSTG were correlated with learning success in the multi-talker training group but not in the single-talker group. These results suggest that talker variability in the training procedure may enhance neural efficiency in these brain areas and strengthen the cooperation between them. Our findings highlight the brain processing of newly learned speech patterns is influenced by the given training approach.","[Deng, Zhizhou] Guangdong Univ Finance & Econ, Dept Appl Psychol, Guangzhou 510320, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Deng, Zhizhou; Wong, Patrick C.

However, the neural mechanisms of this rejection-aggression link remain unclear. A potential clue may be that rejected people often recruit the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex's (VLPFC) self-regulatory processes to manage the pain of rejection. Using functional MRI, we replicated previous links between rejection and activity in the brain's mentalizing network, social pain network and VLPFC. VLPFC recruitment during rejection was associated with greater activity in the brain's reward network (i.e. the ventral striatum) when individuals were given an opportunity to retaliate. This retaliation-related striatal response was associated with greater levels of retaliatory aggression. Dispositionally aggressive individuals exhibited less functional connectivity between the ventral striatum and the right VLPFC during aggression. This connectivity exerted a suppressing effect on dispositionally aggressive individuals' greater aggressive responses to rejection. These results help explain how the pain of rejection and reward of revenge motivate rejected people to behave aggressively.","[Chester, David S.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Psychol, 808 West Franklin St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Lynam, Donald R.] Purdue Univ, Dept Psychol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Milich, Richard; DeWall, C.

The neural underpinnings of empathy have predominantly been studied in the young adult population, thus little is known about how they evolve across the life span. In the present study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate age-related differences in brain activity associated to empathy for positive and negative emotions. Female participants of 3 age groups-adolescents, young, and older adults-underwent an experimental paradigm inducing both first-hand and empathic experience of pleasant and unpleasant touch. Group comparisons and regression analyses revealed that older adults showed lower activation within the anterior insula with respect to young adults, during both empathy conditions. Further analyses provided evidence that years of education, theory of mind ability, gray matter volume, and first-hand affect processing did not account for these effects. These findings indicate that the neural bases of empathy change across different age groups, from adolescence to old age. Different ages and in particular older age seem to significantly influence the way in which we represent and share others' positive and negative emotions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Using fMRI, we investigated the neural correlates of this complex process comprised of both positive and negative outcomes. During a social visual search task, 19 participants gave their advice to a co-actor who then made the decision resulting in a mutual loss or gain. This design allowed direct comparisons of situations that resulted in the same monetary outcome but that differed with respect to the correctness of the initial advice of the participant. Increased striatal activations were found for gains compared to losses and for correct compared to incorrect advice. Importantly, ROI analyses also showed enhanced striatum activation for monetary losses that were preceded by correct compared to incorrect advices. The current study therefore suggests that reward-related neural mechanisms may be involved when being right even in situations that end in monetary losses.","[Ruissen, M.

Social perception in natural environment provides a good example of such capacity as it typically requires the integration of information from different sensory systems, and also from different levels of sensory processing. Here, instead of studying one isolate system and level of representation, we focused upon a neuroimaging paradigm which allows to capture multiple brain representations simultaneously, i.e., low and high-level processing in two different sensory systems, as well as abstract cognitive processing of congruency. Subjects performed social decisions based on the congruency between auditory and visual processing. Using multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, we probed a wide variety of representations. Our results confirmed the expected representations at each level and system according to the literature. Further, beyond the hierarchical organization of the visual, auditory and higher order neural systems, we provide a more nuanced picture of the brain functional architecture. Indeed, brain regions of the same neural system show similarity in their representations, but they also share information with regions from other systems. Further, the strength of neural information varied considerably across domains in a way that was not obviously related to task relevance. For instance, selectivity for task-irrelevant animacy of visual input was very strong. The present approach represents a new way to explore the richness of co-activated brain representations underlying the natural complexity in human cognition.","[Pegado, Felipe; Hendriks, Michelle H.

This form of ""cross-situational'' learning may result from either associative mechanisms that gradually accumulate evidence for each word-object association [4, 5] or rapid proposebut-verify (PbV) mechanisms where only one hypothesized referent is stored for each word, which is either subsequently verified or rejected [6, 7]. Using model-based representation similarity analyses of fMRI data acquired during learning, we find evidence for learning mediated by a PbV mechanism. This learning may be underpinned by rapid pattern-separation processes in the hippocampus.

Despite the complexity of social interactions, humans are adept at interpreting those interactions they observe. Although the brain basis of this remarkable ability has remained relatively unexplored, converging functional MRI evidence suggests the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) is centrally involved. Here, we sought to determine whether this region is sensitive to both the presence of interactive information, as well as to the content of qualitatively different interactions (i.e. competition vs. cooperation). Using point-light human figure stimuli, we demonstrate that the right pSTS is maximally activated when contrasting dyadic interactions vs. dyads performing independent, non-interactive actions. We then used this task to localize the same pSTS region in an independent participant group, and tested responses to nonhuman moving shape stimuli (i.e. two circles' movements conveying either interactive or non-interactive behaviour). We observed significant support vector machine classification for both the presence and type of interaction (i.e. interaction vs. non-interaction, and competition vs. cooperation, respectively) in the pSTS, as well as neighbouring temporo-parietal junction (TPJ). These findings demonstrate the important role that these regions play in perceiving and understanding social interactions, and lay the foundations for further research to fully characterize interaction responses in these areas.","[Walbrin, Jon; Downing, Paul; Koldewyn, Kami] Bangor Univ, Sch Psychol, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales","Walbrin, J (reprint author), Sch Psychol, Penrallt Rd, Bangor LL57 2AS, Gwynedd, Wales.","j.walbrin@bangor.ac.uk","","Koldewyn, Kami/0000-0003-3588-6449; Downing, Paul/0000-0002-5046-2858","European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon research and innovation programme (ERC starting grant: Becoming Social) [ERC-2016-StG-716974]","This work has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) (ERC-2016-StG-716974) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (ERC starting grant: Becoming Social).","","43","1","1","5","6","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","0028-3932","1873-3514","","NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA","Neuropsychologia","APR","2018","112","","","","","","31","39","","10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2018.02.023","","","","9","Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences; Psychology, Experimental","Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychology","GD5CB","WOS:000430521500004","29476765","Green Published, Other Gold","","","2019-02-21","searchterm","searchterm_records_1-500.txt"

Over the past several decades, numerous theories have been proposed to account for the influence of alcohol on aggression. Nearly all of these theories imply that altered functioning in the prefrontal cortex is a proximal cause. In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment, 50 healthy young men consumed either a low dose of alcohol or a placebo and completed an aggression paradigm against provocative and nonprovocative opponents. Provocation did not affect neural responses. However, relative to sober participants, during acts of aggression, intoxicated participants showed decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex, caudate, and ventral striatum, but heightened activation in the hippocampus. Among intoxicated participants, but not among sober participants, aggressive behavior was positively correlated with activation in the medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These results support theories that posit a role for prefrontal cortical dysfunction as an important factor in intoxicated aggression.","[Denson, Thomas F.; Blundell, Kate A.; Schofield, Timothy P.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Schira, Mark M.] Neurosci Res Australia, POB 1165, Randwick, NSW 2031, Australia; [Schira, Mark M.] Univ Wollongong, Sch Psychol, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Kraemer, Ulrike M.] Univ Lubeck, Dept Neurol, Ratzeburger Allee 160, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany; [Kraemer, Ulrike M.] Univ Lubeck, Inst Psychol 2, Ratzeburger Allee 160, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany","Denson, TF (reprint author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.","t.denson@unsw.edu.au","","Denson, Thomas/0000-0002-9620-4280; Kramer, Ulrike M./0000-0002-3841-1812","","","","63","0","0","1","3","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","1530-7026","1531-135X","","COGN AFFECT BEHAV NE","Cogn.

Although it is established that prosocial behaviors are linked to positive outcomes in adulthood, little is known about the neural correlates of adolescents' prosociality. Identifying whether the brain is differentially responsive to varying types of social input may be important for fostering prosocial behavior. We report pilot results using new stimuli and an ecologically valid donation paradigm indicating (1) brain regions typically recruited during socioemotional processing evinced differential activation when adolescents evaluated prosocial compared with social or noninteractive scenes (N = 20, ages 13-17 years, M (Age) = 15.30 years), and (2) individual differences in temporoparietal junction recruitment when viewing others' prosocial behaviors were related to adolescents' own charitable giving. These novel findings have significant implications for understanding how the adolescent brain processes prosocial acts and for informing ways to support adolescents to engage in prosocial behaviors in their daily lives.","[Tashjian, Sarah M.; Galvan, Adriana] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, 1285 Franz Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Weissman, David G.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Psychol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Weissman, David G.; Guyer, Amanda E.] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Mind & Brain, Davis, CA 95618 USA; [Guyer, Amanda E.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Human Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Galvan, Adriana] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Brain Res Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Tashjian, SM; Galvan, A (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, 1285 Franz Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.; Galvan, A (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Brain Res Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.","smtashjian@ucla.edu; agalvan@ucla.edu","","","University of California (UC) Consortium on the Developmental Science of Adolescence - UC Office of the President, Multicampus Research Programs and Initiatives [MRP-17-454825]; National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship; Jeffrey/Wenzel Chair in Behavioral Neuroscience","This work was supported by a grant from the University of California (UC) Consortium on the Developmental Science of Adolescence awarded from the UC Office of the President, Multicampus Research Programs and Initiatives (Grant ID: MRP-17-454825), a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship to S.M.T., and Jeffrey/Wenzel Chair in Behavioral Neuroscience to A.G.","","47","0","0","3","6","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","1530-7026","1531-135X","","COGN AFFECT BEHAV NE","Cogn.

Research has indicated that individuals with better critical thinking disposition can better recognize and regulate their emotions, though the neuroanatomical mechanisms involved in this process remain to be elucidated. Further, the influence of emotional intelligence on the relationship between brain structure and critical thinking disposition has not been examined. The present study utilized voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to investigate the neural structures underlying critical thinking disposition in a large sample of college students (N = 296). Regional gray matter volume (rGMV) in the bilateral temporal pole, which reflects an individual's ability to process social and emotional information, was negatively correlated with critical thinking disposition. In addition, rGMV in bilateral para hippocampal regions -regions involved in contextual association/emotional regulation-exhibited negative correlation with critical thinking disposition. Further analysis revealed that emotional intelligence moderated the relationship between rGMV of the temporal pole and critical thinking disposition. Specifically, critical thinking disposition was associated with decreased GMV of the temporal pole for individuals who have relatively higher emotional intelligence rather than lower emotional intelligence. The results of the present study indicate that people who have higher emotional intelligence exhibit more effective and automatic processing of emotional information and tend to be strong critical thinkers.","[Yao, Xiaonan; Yuan, Shuge; Yang, Wenjing; Chen, Qunlin; Wei, Dongtao; Hou, Yuling; Zhang, Lijie; Qiu, Jiang; Yang, Dong] Southwest Univ, Dept Psychol, 2 TianSheng Rd, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China; [Yang, Wenjing; Chen, Qunlin; Wei, Dongtao; Qiu, Jiang] Southwest Univ, Dept Psychol, Key Lab Cognit & Personal SWU, Minist Educ, 2 TianSheng Rd, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China","Qiu, J; Yang, D (reprint author), Southwest Univ, Dept Psychol, 2 TianSheng Rd, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China.; Qiu, J (reprint author), Southwest Univ, Dept Psychol, Key Lab Cognit & Personal SWU, Minist Educ, 2 TianSheng Rd, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China.","wspgy123@163.com; 759656995@qq.com; qiuj318@swu.edu.cn; yangd@swu.edu.cn","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31271087, 31470981, 31571137, 31500885]; National Outstanding young people plan; Program for the Top Young Talents by Chongqing; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [SWU1509383, SWU1509451]; Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing [cstc2015jcyjA10106]; Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation [151023]; General Financial Grant from the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015 M572423, 2015 M580767]; Special Funds from the Chongqing Postdoctoral Science Foundation [Xm2015037]; Key research for Humanities and social sciences of Ministry of Education [14JJD880009]","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31271087; 31470981; 31571137; 31500885), National Outstanding young people plan, the Program for the Top Young Talents by Chongqing, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (SWU1509383, SWU1509451), Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing (cstc2015jcyjA10106), Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation (151023), General Financial Grant from the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2015 M572423, 2015 M580767), Special Funds from the Chongqing Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Xm2015037), Key research for Humanities and social sciences of Ministry of Education(14JJD880009).","","74","2","2","5","12","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","1931-7557","1931-7565","","BRAIN IMAGING BEHAV","Brain Imaging Behav.","APR","2018","12","2","","","","","488","498","","10.1007/s11682-017-9701-3","","","","11","Neuroimaging","Neurosciences & Neurology","GB4KM","WOS:000429029000018","28357535","","","","2019-02-21","searchterm","searchterm_records_1-500.txt"

Using a linear support vector machine classifier on brain-wide multi-voxel patterns, we accurately decoded each individual class in the self-focused task. When generalizing the classifier from the self-focused task to the other-focused task, we also accurately decoded whether subjects focused on the emotional actions, interoceptive sensations and situations of others.

We examined the neural representation of known others along a continuum of attachment using fMRI. Heterosexual adults 16 females), in romantic relationships for more than 2 years, made trait judgments for a romantic partner, parent, close friend, familiar acquaintance and self-during scanning. Multivariate analysis, partial least squares, was used to identify whole-brain patterns of brain activation associated with trait judgments of known others across a continuum of attachment. Across conditions, trait judgments engaged the default network and lateral prefrontal cortex. Judgments about oneself and a partner were associated with a common activation pattern encompassing anterior and middle cingulate, posterior superior temporal sulcus, as well as anterior insula. Parent and close friend judgments engaged medial and anterior temporal lobe regions. These results provide novel evidence that mentalizing about known familiar others results in differential brain activity.

After recalling moral transgression with strong feelings of guilt and shame, participants either actually cleaned their faces with a wipe or were primed with cleanliness through viewing its pictures. Results showed that actual physical cleaning reduced the spontaneous brain activities in the right insula and MPFC, regions that involved in embodied moral emotion processing, while priming of cleaning decreased activities in the right superior frontal gyrus and middle frontal gyrus, regions that participated in executive control processing. Additionally, actual physical cleaning also changed functional connectivity between insula/MPFC and emotion related regions, whereas priming of cleaning modified connectivity within both moral and sensorimotor areas.

In a first study, a large sample of authentic public service announcements (PSAs) targeting the risks of alcohol was characterized using established measures of message effectiveness. In the main study, we used inter-subject correlation analysis of fMRI data to examine brain responses to more and less effective PSAs in a sample of young adults. We find that more effective messages command more similar responses within widespread brain regions, including the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, insulae and precuneus. In previous research, these regions have been related to processing narratives, emotional stimuli, self-relevance and attention towards salient stimuli. The present study thus suggests that more effective health prevention messages have greater 'neural reach', i.e. they engage the brains of audience members' more widely.

Interruptions that require switching of attention to other event sequences disrupt this process. To reveal neural mechanisms supporting integration of event information, we measured brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) from 18 participants while they viewed 6.5-minute excerpts from three movies (i) consecutively and (ii) as interleaved segments of approximately 50-s in duration. We measured inter-subject reliability of brain activity by calculating inter-subject correlations (ISC) of fMRI signals and analyzed activation timecourses with a general linear model (GLM). Interleaving decreased the ISC in posterior temporal lobes, medial prefrontal cortex, superior precuneus, medial occipital cortex, and cerebellum. In the GLM analyses, posterior temporal lobes were activated more consistently by instances of speech when the movies were viewed consecutively than as interleaved segments. By contrast, low-level auditory and visual stimulus features and editing boundaries caused similar activity patterns in both conditions. In the medial occipital cortex, decreases in ISC were seen in short bursts throughout the movie clips. By contrast, the other areas showed longer-lasting differences in ISC during isolated scenes depicting socially-relevant and suspenseful content, such as deception or inter-subject conflict. The areas in the posterior temporal lobes also showed sustained activity during continuous actions and were deactivated when actions ended at scene boundaries. Our results suggest that the posterior temporal and dorsomedial prefrontal cortices, as well as the cerebellum and dorsal precuneus, support integration of events into coherent event sequences.

Participants assigned to an arbitrary team (i.e., Eagles or Rattlers) underwent fMRI while categorizing political and arbitrary in-group and out-group members. We found that frontoparietal control network exhibited repetition suppression in response to ""identical in-group"" (Democrat-Democrat or Eagles-Eagles) and ""different in-group"" (Eagles-Democrat or Democrat-Eagles) trials relative to ""out-group/in-group trials"" (Republican-Democrat or Rattler-Eagles). Specifically, the repetition suppression contrast map included bilateral superior parietal lobule, bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and bilateral middle temporal gyrus. Participants who reported an increased tendency to join and value their social groups exhibited decreased repetition suppression in bilateral DLPFC. Comparison of our whole-brain repetition suppression map with an independently identified map of frontoparietal control network revealed 34.3% overlap. Social categorization requires recognizing both a target's group membership but also the target's orientation toward one's self. Fittingly, we find that generalized social categorization engages a network that acts as a functional bridge between dorsal attentional (exogenously-oriented) and default mode (internally-oriented) networks.","[Lau, Tatiana; Cikara, Mina] Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, 33 Kirkland St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Cikara, M (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, 33 Kirkland St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.","mcikara@fas.harvard.edu","","","Berkman Faculty Development Grant; Pershing Square Venture Fund for Research on the Foundations of Human Behavior","We would like to thank Jordyn Greenberg, Deborah Viszlay, and Scott Kurdilla for assistance with data collection.

However, it remains unclear if Big Five personality traits are represented in frequency bands (similar to 0.25 Hz) of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity. Based on earlier neurophysiological studies, we investigated the correlation between the five personality traits assessed by the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI), and the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) at four distinct frequency bands (slow-5 (0.01-0.027 Hz), slow-4 (0.027-0.073 Hz), slow-3 (0.073-0.198 Hz) and slow-2 (0.198-0.25 Hz)). We enrolled 835 young subjects and calculated the correlations of resting-state fMRI signals using a multiple regression analysis. We found a significant and consistent correlation between fALFF and the personality trait of extraversion at all frequency bands. Furthermore, significant correlations were detected in distinct brain regions for each frequency band. This finding supports the frequency-specific spatial representations of personality traits as previously suggested. In conclusion, our data highlight an association between human personality traits and fALFF at four distinct frequency bands.","[Ikeda, Shigeyuki; Nozawa, Takayuki] Tohoku Univ, Inst Dev Aging & Canc, Dept Ubiquitous Sensing, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Takeuchi, Hikaru; Taki, Yasuyuki; Yokota, Susumu; Kawashima, Ryuta] Tohoku Univ, Inst Dev Aging & Canc, Div Dev Cognit Neurosci, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Taki, Yasuyuki; Sekiguchi, Atsushi] Tohoku Univ, Tohoku Med Megabank Org, Dept Community Med Supports, Div Med Neuroimaging, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Taki, Yasuyuki] Tohoku Univ, Inst Dev Aging & Canc, Dept Radiol & Nucl Med, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Nouchi, Rui] Tohoku Univ, Frontier Res Inst Interdisciplinary Sci, Creat Interdisciplinary Res Div, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Nouchi, Rui] Tohoku Univ, Int Res Inst Disaster Sci, Human & Social Response Res Div, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Nouchi, Rui; Araki, Tsuyoshi; Kawashima, Ryuta] Tohoku Univ, Inst Dev Aging & Canc, Smart Ageing Int Res Ctr, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Yokoyama, Ryoichi] Kobe Univ, Sch Med, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan; [Kotozaki, Yuka] Fukushima Med Univ, Sch Med, Med Ind Translat Res Ctr, Div Clin Res, Fukushima, Japan; [Nakagawa, Seishu] Tohoku Med & Pharmaceut Univ, Div Psychiat, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Nakagawa, Seishu] Tohoku Univ, Inst Dev Aging & Canc, Dept Funct Brain Sci, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Sekiguchi, Atsushi; Yamamoto, Yuki; Hanawa, Sugiko; Kawashima, Ryuta] Tohoku Univ, Inst Dev Aging & Canc, Dept Funct Brain Imaging, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Sekiguchi, Atsushi] Natl Inst Mental Hlth, Natl Ctr Neurol & Psychiat, Dept Adult Mental Hlth, Tokyo, Japan; [Iizuka, Kunio] Tohoku Univ Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Miyauchi, Carlos Makoto] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Arts & Sci, Dept Gen Syst Studies, Tokyo, Japan; [Sakaki, Kohei] Tohoku Univ, Inst Dev Aging & Canc, Dept Adv Brain Sci, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Magistro, Daniele] Loughborough Univ Technol, Sch Sport Exercise & Hlth, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Magistro, Daniele] Loughborough Univ Technol, NCSEM, Loughborough, Leics, England","Ikeda, S (reprint author), Tohoku Univ, Inst Dev Aging & Canc, Dept Ubiquitous Sensing, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.","shigeyuki.ikeda.e2@tohoku.ac.jp","","Magistro, Daniele/0000-0002-2554-3701","JST/RISTEX; JST/CREST; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology [KAKENHI 23700306, KAKENHI 25700012]","This work was supported by JST/RISTEX, JST/CREST and a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) (KAKENHI 23700306) and Young Scientists (A) (KAKENHI 25700012) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.

Detection of subtle cues indicating sickness and avoidance of sick conspecifics would therefore be an adaptive way of coping with an environment fraught with pathogens. This study determines how humans perceive and integrate early cues of sickness in conspecifics sampled just hours after the induction of immune system activation, and the underlying neural mechanisms for this detection. In a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design, the immune system in 22 sample donors was transiently activated with an endotoxin injection [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)]. Facial photographs and body odor samples were taken from the same donors when ""sick"" (LPS-injected) and when ""healthy"" (saline-injected) and subsequently were presented to a separate group of participants (n = 30) who rated their liking of the presented person during fMRI scanning. Faces were less socially desirable when sick, and sick body odors tended to lower liking of the faces. Sickness status presented by odor and facial photograph resulted in increased neural activation of odor-and faceperception networks, respectively. A superadditive effect of olfactory-visual integration of sickness cues was found in the intraparietal sulcus, which was functionally connected to core areas of multisensory integration in the superior temporal sulcus and orbitofrontal cortex. Taken together, the results outline a disease-avoidance model in which neural mechanisms involved in the detection of disease cues and multisensory integration are vital parts.","[Regenbogen, Christina; Axelsson, John; Lasselin, Julie; Porada, Danja K.; Sundelin, Tina; Peter, Moa G.; Lekander, Mats; Lundstroem, Johan N.; Olsson, Mats J.] Karolinska Inst, Dept Clin Neurosci, Div Psychol, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Regenbogen, Christina] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Med Sch, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Regenbogen, Christina] Julich Aachen Res Alliance, BRAIN Inst 1, Struct Funct Relationship, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Axelsson, John; Lasselin, Julie; Lekander, Mats] Stockholm Univ, Stress Res Inst, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Lasselin, Julie] Univ Klinikum Essen, Inst Med Psychol & Behav Immunobiol, D-45147 Essen, Germany; [Sundelin, Tina] Stockholm Univ, Dept Psychol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Lundstroem, Johan N.] Monell Chem Senses Ctr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Lundstroem, Johan N.] Univ Penn, Dept Psychol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Regenbogen, C (reprint author), Karolinska Inst, Dept Clin Neurosci, Div Psychol, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden.; Regenbogen, C (reprint author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Med Sch, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.; Regenbogen, C (reprint author), Julich Aachen Res Alliance, BRAIN Inst 1, Struct Funct Relationship, D-52425 Julich, Germany.","cregenbogen@ukaachen.de; mats.j.olsson@ki.se","Regenbogen, Christina/A-9691-2016; Lundstrom, Johan/E-9482-2014","Regenbogen, Christina/0000-0001-5950-798X; Lundstrom, Johan/0000-0002-3529-8981; Axelsson, John/0000-0003-3932-7310; Lasselin, Julie/0000-0001-8323-0714","Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst Postdoctoral Fellowship [91518477]; Swedish Research Council [2012-1125, 2016-02742, 2014-1346]; Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences [P12-1017]; Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation [KAW 2012.0141]","We thank Maria Garke for contributions during data collection and Jonathan Berrebi and Rouslan Sitnikov for optimizing the scan protocol.

Whereas the physical pain task featured faces expressing dynamic suffering, the social pain task featured victims of apartheid violence from the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission to elicit heartfelt emotion. Black participants' behavioral responses were suggestive of in group favoritism, whereas White participants' responses were apparently egalitarian. However, all participants showed significant in-group biases in activation in the amygdala (physical pain), as well as areas involved in mental state representation, including the precuneus, temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and frontal pole (physical and social pain). Additionally, Black participants reacted with heightened moral indignation to own-race suffering, whereas White participants reacted with heightened shame to Black suffering, which was associated with blunted neural empathic responding.

A challenge that people encounter is that they often lack detailed specifics about distant relative to near future events. Construal level theory proposes that people represent distant future events by their abstract and essential features-a process referred to as high-level construal. As events become temporally proximal, people represent events by their increasingly available and reliable concrete and idiosyncratic features-a process referred to as low-level construal. The present fMRI experiment provides direct neural evidence for these assertions. Using the why-how localizer as a measure of construal level, results revealed brain regions associated with both temporal distance and high-level construal (medial prefrontal cortex), as well as temporal proximity and low-level construal (precuneus).

Behavioral Inhibition System/Behavioral Activation System (BIS/BAS) scales have been developed to quantitatively assess these traits. However, neural mechanisms corresponding to the proposed constructs reflected in BIS/BAS are still poorly defined. The ventral striatum (VS) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) are implicated in subserving reward-related functions that are also associated with the BAS. In this study, we examined whether functional connectivity between these regions predicts components of these scales. We employed resting-state functional connectivity and BIS/BAS scores assessed by a personality questionnaire. Participants completed a resting state run and the Behavioral Inhibition and Activation Systems (BIS/BAS) Questionnaire. Using resting-state BOLD, we assessed correlations between two basal ganglia ROIs (caudate and putamen) and bilateral OFC ROIs, establishing single subject connectivity summary scores. Summary scores were correlated with components of BIS/BAS scores. Results demonstrate a novel correlation between BAS-fun seeking and resting-state connectivity between middle OFC and putamen, implying that spontaneous synchrony between reward-processing regions may play a role in defining personality characteristics related to impulsivity.","[Angelides, Nicholas H.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Psychol, 3210 Tolman Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gupta, Jayesh; Vickery, Timothy J.] Univ Delaware, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, 108 Wolf Hall, Newark, DE 19176 USA","Vickery, TJ (reprint author), Univ Delaware, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, 108 Wolf Hall, Newark, DE 19176 USA.","tvickery@psych.udel.edu","","","University of Delaware Research Foundation; NSF [BCS 1558535, OIA 1632849]","This study was funded by a University of Delaware Research Foundation Grant in conjunction with NSF BCS 1558535 and NSF OIA 1632849 to Timothy Vickery.","","59","1","1","1","3","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

Using fMRI, we measured the brain activity while male entrepreneurs viewed pictures of their own and of a familiar firm, and while fathers viewed pictures of their own and of a familiar child. The entrepreneurs who self-rated as being very closely attached with their venture showed a similar suppression of activity in the posterior cingulate cortex, temporoparietal junction, and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex as fathers during viewing pictures of their own children versus familiar children. In addition, individual differences in the confidence trait influenced the neural encoding of both paternal and entrepreneurial processing. For underconfident fathers, a picture of one's own child was associated with stronger activation and for overconfident fathers with weaker activation in the amygdala and in caudate nucleus, a brain structure associated with processing of rewards. Similar association with activation, yet more widespread in the emotional processing network, was observed in entrepreneurs suggesting a similar neural basis for increased sensitivity to threats and potential risks concerning one's venture and child. In conclusion, both entrepreneurial and parental love seem to be supported by brain structures associated with reward and emotional processing as well as social understanding.

We also examined the neural correlates underlying Cyberball, the most commonly used paradigm to study exclusion, as well as differences in exclusion-related activation between developing (7-18 years of age, from pre-adolescence up to late adolescence) and emerging adult (broadly defined as undergraduates, including late adolescence and young adulthood) samples. Results revealed involvement of the bilateral medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices, right precuneus and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex across the different paradigms used to examine social exclusion; similar activation patterns were identified when restricting the analysis to Cyberball studies. Investigations into age-related effects revealed that ventrolateral prefrontal activations identified in the full sample were driven by (i.e. present in) developmental samples, while medial prefrontal activations were driven by emerging adult samples. In addition, the right ventral striatum was implicated in exclusion, but only in developmental samples.

The present study examined the common activation foci of morality-related task conditions. In addition, the study compared the neural correlates of moral sensitivity with the neural correlates of moral judgment, which are the two functional components in the Neo-Kohlbergian model of moral functioning. The results showed that brain regions associated with the default mode network were significantly more active during morality-related task conditions than during non-morality task conditions. These brain regions were also commonly activated in both moral judgment and moral sensitivity task conditions. In contrast, the right temporoparietal junction and supramarginal gyrus were found to be more active only during conditions of moral judgment. These findings suggest that the neural correlates of moral sensitivity and moral judgment are perhaps commonly associated with brain circuitries of self-related psychological processes, but the neural correlates of those two functional components are distinguishable from each other.","[Han, Hyemin] Univ Alabama, Educ Psychol Program, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA","Han, H (reprint author), Univ Alabama, Educ Psychol Program, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.","hyemin.han@ua.edu","","Han, Hyemin/0000-0001-7181-2565","Center for East Asian Studies Summer Grants of Stanford University","This work was partially supported by Center for East Asian Studies Summer Grants of Stanford University.","","93","9","10","2","11","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","0305-7240","1465-3877","","J MORAL EDUC","J.

Few studies investigated how the effect of sleep compares with (and interacts with) these other factors, of which virtually none are in children. The present study did so by repeated assessment of declarative memory in 386 children (45% boys) aged 9-11years through an online word-pair task. Children were randomly assigned to either a morning or evening learning session of 30 unrelated word-pairs with positive, neutral or negative valenced cues and neutral targets. After immediately assessing baseline recognition, delayed recognition was recorded either 12 or 24h later, resulting in four different assessment schedules. One week later, the procedure was repeated with exactly the same word-pairs to evaluate whether effects differed for relearning versus original novel learning. Mixed-effect logistic regression models were used to evaluate how the probability of correct recognition was affected by sleep, valence, arousal, novelty and their interactions. Both immediate and delayed recognition were worse for pairs with negatively valenced or less arousing cue words. Relearning improved immediate and delayed word-pair recognition. In contrast to these effects, sleep did not affect recognition, nor did sleep moderate the effects of arousal, valence and novelty. The findings suggest a robust inclination of children to specifically forget the pairing of words to negatively valenced cue words. In agreement with a recent meta-analysis, children seem to depend less on sleep for the consolidation of information than has been reported for adults, irrespective of the emotional valence, arousal and novelty of word-pairs.","[Vermeulen, Marije C.

Attachment-derived expectations about the self and others in terms of internal attachment working models have the potential to shape such social reorientation processes critically and thereby influence adolescents' social-emotional development and social integration. Because the neural underpinnings of this developmental task remain largely unknown, we sought to investigate them by functional magnetic resonance imaging. We asked n = 44 adolescents (ages 12.01-18.84 years) to evaluate positive and negative adjectives regarding either themselves or a close other during an adapted version of the well-established self-other trait-evaluation task. As measures of attachment, we obtained scores reflecting participants' positive versus negative attachment-derived self- and other-models by means of the Relationship Questionnaire. We controlled for possible confounding factors by also obtaining scores reflecting internalizing/externalizing problems, schizotypy, and borderline symptomatology. Our results revealed that participants with a more negative attachment-derived self-model showed increased brain activity during positive and negative adjective evaluation regarding the self, but decreased brain activity during negative adjective evaluation regarding a close other, in bilateral amygdala/parahippocampus, bilateral anterior temporal pole/anterior superior temporal gyrus, and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that a low positivity of the self-concept characteristic for the attachment anxiety dimension may influence neural information processing, but in opposite directions when it comes to self- versus (close) other-representations. We discuss our results in the framework of attachment theory and regarding their implications especially for adolescent social-emotional development and social integration.","[Debbane, Martin; Badoud, Deborah] Univ Geneva, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, Dev Clin Psychol Res Unit, Geneva, Switzerland; [Debbane, Martin; Eliez, Stephan] Univ Geneva, Dept Psychiat, Sch Med, Off Medicopedag Res Unit, Geneva, Switzerland; [Debbane, Martin; Luyten, Patrick] UCL, Res Dept Clin Educ & Hlth Psychol, London, England; [Sander, David] Univ Geneva, Swiss Ctr Affect Sci, Geneva, Switzerland; [Sander, David] Univ Geneva, Dept Psychol, Lab Study Emot Elicitat & Express, Geneva, Switzerland; [Luyten, Patrick] Univ Leuven, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, Leuven, Belgium; [Vrticka, Pascal] Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Dept Social Neurosci, Leipzig, Germany","Vrticka, P (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Dept Social Neurosci, Leipzig, Germany.","vrticka@cbs.mpg.de","Vrticka, Pascal/U-9166-2018","Vrticka, Pascal/0000-0002-8920-5509; Debbane, Martin/0000-0002-4677-8753","Max Planck Society; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [100014-135311/1, PP00B-102864]; National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) ""Synapsy-The Synaptic Bases of Mental Diseases"" (SNSF) [51AU40_125759]; Gertrude Von Meissner Foundation [ME7871]; NCCR Affective Sciences - Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [51NF40-104897]","Open access funding provided by Max Planck Society.

We do not know however whether this OXT effect extends to possessions. We tend to place a higher monetary value on specific objects that belong to us compared to others, known as the ""endowment effect"". In two double-blind, between-subject placebo (PLC) controlled experiments in subjects from a collectivist culture, we investigated the influence of intranasal OXT on the endowment effect, with the second study incorporating functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In the task, subjects decided whether to buy or sell their own or others' (mother/father/classmate/stranger) possessions at various prices. Both experiments demonstrated an endowment effect in the self-owned condition which extended to close others (mother/father) and OXT increased this for self and all other-owned items. This OXT effect was associated with reduced activity in the ventral mPFC (vmPFC) in the self-owned condition but increased in the mother-condition. For the classmateand stranger-owned conditions OXT increased activity in the dorsal mPFC (dmPFC). Changes in vmPFC activation were associated with the size of the endowment effect for self-and mother-owned items. Functional connectivity between the dmPFC and ventral striatum (VStr) was reduced by OXT in self-and mother-owned conditions and between vmPFC and precuneus in the self-condition. Overall our results show that OXT enhances the endowment effect for both self-and other-owned items in Chinese subjects. This effect is associated with reduced mPFC activation in the self-condition but enhanced activation in all other-conditions and involves differential actions on both dorsal and ventral regions as well as functional connectivity with brain reward and other self-processing regions. Overall our findings suggest that OXT increases the perceived value of both self-and other-owned items by acting on neural circuitry involved in self-processing and reward.","[Zhao, Weihua; Geng, Yayuan; Luo, Lizhu; Zhao, Zhiying; Ma, Xiaole; Xu, Lei; Yao, Shuxia; Kendrick, Keith M.] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Ctr Informat Med, Key Lab Neuroinformat, Chengdu, Peoples R China","Kendrick, KM (reprint author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Ctr Informat Med, Key Lab Neuroinformat, Chengdu, Peoples R China.","k.kendrick.uestc@gmail.com","","Xu, Lei/0000-0001-9942-0117; Yao, Shuxia/0000-0002-5259-6374; Ma, Xiaole/0000-0002-6809-9014","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31530032]","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) grant number: 31530032.","","61","7","7","0","6","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","PO BOX 110, EPFL INNOVATION PARK, BUILDING I, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND","1662-5161","","","FRONT HUM NEUROSCI","Front.

It remains largely unclear which degree of reliability can be achieved in developmental studies and whether this depends on the type of task used. Therefore, we aimed to systematically investigate the reliability of three well-classified tasks: an emotional attention, a cognitive control, and an intertemporal choice paradigm. We hypothesized to find higher reliability in the cognitive task than in the emotional or reward-related task. 104 healthy mid-adolescents were scanned at age 14 and again at age 16 within M=1.8 years using the same paradigms, scanner, and scanning protocols. Overall, we found both variability and stability (i.e. poor to excellent ICCs) depending largely on the region of interest (ROI) and task. Contrary to our hypothesis, whole brain reliability was fair for the cognitive control task but good for the emotional attention and intertemporal choice task. Subcortical ROIs (ventral striatum, amygdala) resulted in lower ICCs than visual ROIs. Current results add to the yet sparse overall ICC literature in both developing samples and adults. This study shows that analyses of stability, i.e. reliability, are helpful benchmarks for longitudinal studies and their implications for adolescent development.","[Vetter, Nora C.; Steding, Julius; Jurk, Sarah; Ripke, Stephan; Mennigen, Eva; Smolka, Michael N.] Tech Univ Dresden, Dept Psychiat, Dresden, Germany; [Vetter, Nora C.; Steding, Julius; Jurk, Sarah; Ripke, Stephan; Mennigen, Eva; Smolka, Michael N.] Tech Univ Dresden, Neuroimaging Ctr, Dresden, Germany; [Vetter, Nora C.; Steding, Julius] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Med, Dept Child & Adolescent Psychiat, Dresden, Germany; [Vetter, Nora C.] Berg Univ Wuppertal, Dept Psychol, Wuppertal, Germany; [Steding, Julius] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Med, Div Psychol & Social Med & Dev Neurosci, Dresden, Germany","Vetter, NC; Smolka, MN (reprint author), Tech Univ Dresden, Dept Psychiat, Dresden, Germany.; Vetter, NC; Smolka, MN (reprint author), Tech Univ Dresden, Neuroimaging Ctr, Dresden, Germany.; Vetter, NC (reprint author), Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Med, Dept Child & Adolescent Psychiat, Dresden, Germany.; Vetter, NC (reprint author), Berg Univ Wuppertal, Dept Psychol, Wuppertal, Germany.","nora.vetter@tu-dresden.de; michael.smolka@tu-dresden.de","","Smolka, Michael/0000-0001-5398-5569; Vetter, Nora C./0000-0003-1477-5395","German Ministry of Education and Research [01 EV 0711, 01 EE 1406B]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB 940/1]; Medical Faculty of the Technische Universitat Dresden; Max Kade Foundation, NY, USA","This work was supported by the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF grants # 01 EV 0711, 01 EE 1406B), the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (SFB 940/1), and the MedDrive Start Grant of the Medical Faculty of the Technische Universitat Dresden.

Disruption of ties through social exclusion has a marked effect on our thoughts and feelings; however, such effects can be tempered by broader social network resources. Here, we use fMRI data acquired from 80 male adolescents to investigate how social exclusion modulates functional connectivity within and across brain networks involved in social pain and understanding the mental states of others (i.e., mentalizing). Furthermore, using objectively logged friendship network data, we examine how individual variability in brain reactivity to social exclusion relates to the density of participants' friendship networks, an important aspect of social network structure. We find increased connectivity within a set of regions previously identified as a mentalizing system during exclusion relative to inclusion. These results are consistent across the regions of interest as well as a whole-brain analysis. Next, examining how social network characteristics are associated with task-based connectivity dynamics, we find that participants who showed greater changes in connectivity within the mentalizing system when socially excluded by peers had less dense friendship networks. This work provides insight to understand how distributed brain systems respond to social and emotional challenges and how such brain dynamics might vary based on broader social network characteristics.","[Schmlazle, Ralf] Michigan State Univ, Dept Commun, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Schmlazle, Ralf; O'Donnell, Matthew Brook; Cascio, Christopher N.; Falk, Emily B.] Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Garcia, Javier O.; Vettel, Jean M.] US Army Res Lab, Human Res & Engn Directorate, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005 USA; [Bayer, Joseph] Ohio State Univ, Sch Commun, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Bassett, Danielle S.; Vettel, Jean M.] Univ Penn, Dept Bioengn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Bassett, Danielle S.] Univ Penn, Dept Elect & Syst Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Vettel, Jean M.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Falk, EB (reprint author), Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.","falk@asc.upenn.edu","Bayer, Joseph/S-7211-2016","Bayer, Joseph/0000-0002-6555-4472","Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [R21HD073549]; NIH [1DP2DA03515601]; Army Research Laboratory [W911NF-10-2-0022]; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency [YFA-D14AP00048]; John D. and Catherine T.

Other forms of love such as romantic or maternal attachment have previously been studied from a neuroimaging point of view. Here we aimed to investigate the neural basis of this tribal form of love, which implies both the feeling of belongingness and rivalry against opposing teams. A pool of 56 participants was submitted to an fMRI experimental design involving the presentation of winning and losing football moments of their loved, rival or neutral teams. We found recruitment of amygdala and reward regions, including the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN), as well as other limbic regions involved in emotional cognition, for 'positive vs neutral' and 'positive vs negative' conditions. The latter contrast was correlated with neuropsychological scores of fanaticism in the amygdala and regions within the reward system, as the VTA and SN. The observation of increased response patterns in critical components of the reward system, in particular for positive content related to the loved team, suggests that this kind of non-romantic love reflects a specific arousal and motivational state, which is biased for emotional learning of positive outcomes.","[Duarte, Isabel C.; Afonso, Sonia; Ferreira, Carlos; Castelo-Branco, Miguel] Univ Coimbra, ICNAS, Inst Nucl Sci Appl Hlth, Coimbra, Portugal; [Duarte, Isabel C.; Afonso, Sonia; Jorge, Helena; Ferreira, Carlos; Castelo-Branco, Miguel] Univ Coimbra, Inst Biomed Imaging & Life Sci, CNC IBILI, Coimbra, Portugal; [Cayolla, Ricardo] Univ Aveiro, Dept Econ Management Ind Engn & Tourism, DEGEIT, Aveiro, Portugal","Castelo-Branco, M (reprint author), Univ Coimbra, ICNAS, P-3000548 Coimbra, Portugal.","mcbranco@fmed.uc.pt","","Cipriano Ferreira, Carlos Daniel/0000-0002-0629-7146; Cayolla, Ricardo/0000-0003-4015-7363; Duarte, Isabel Catarina/0000-0002-5620-2424","BRAINTRAIN project [FP7-HEALTH-2013-INNOVATION-1-602186]; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) [FCT-UID/NEU/04539/2013, POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007440]; Bial Foundation [132/12, 133/12, 373/14, CENTRO-07-ST24-FEDER-00205]","This work was supported by, the BRAINTRAIN project FP7-HEALTH-2013-INNOVATION-1-602186, Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) FCT-UID/NEU/04539/2013,-COMPETE, POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007440, Bial Foundation 132/12, 133/12 and 373/14, CENTRO-07-ST24-FEDER-00205.","","45","2","2","1","9","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

An open question concerns the functional role of their ability to match observed and executed actions. Since understanding of goals requires conscious perception of actions, we expect that mirror neurons potentially involved in action goal coding, will be modulated by changes in action perception level. Here, we manipulated perception level of action videos depicting short hand movements and measured the corresponding fMRI BOLD responses in mirror regions. Our results show that activity levels within a network of regions, including the sensorimotor cortex, primary motor cortex, dorsal premotor cortex and posterior superior temporal sulcus, are sensitive to changes in action perception level, whereas activity levels in the inferior frontal gyrus, ventral premotor cortex, supplementary motor area and superior parietal lobule are invariant to such changes. In addition, this parcellation to two sub-networks manifest as smaller functional distances within each group of regions during task and resting state. Our results point to functional differences between regions within the mirror neurons system which may have implications with respect to their possible role in action understanding.","[Mukamel, Roy] Tel Aviv Univ, Sagol Sch Neurosci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Mukamel, Roy] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Psychol Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Mukamel, R (reprint author), Tel Aviv Univ, Sagol Sch Neurosci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.; Mukamel, R (reprint author), Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Psychol Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.","rmukamel@post.tau.ac.il","","Mukamel, Roy/0000-0001-9359-8950","I-CORE Program of the Planning and Budgeting Committee; Israel Science Foundation [51/11, 1771/13, 2043/13]; Human Frontiers Science Project (HFSP) Career Development Award [CDA00078/2011-C]; Sagol School of Neuroscience","This study was supported by the I-CORE Program of the Planning and Budgeting Committee and The Israel Science Foundation (grant No. 51/11), The Israel Science Foundation (grants Nos 1771/13 and 2043/13), and Human Frontiers Science Project (HFSP) Career Development Award (CDA00078/2011-C) (R.M.); The Sagol School of Neuroscience fellowship (S.S.).

Understanding how these regions influence each other (the network structure) is an important step to characterize the neural basis of cognitive processes. Often, limited evidence is available to restrict the range of hypotheses a priori, and techniques that sift efficiently through a large number of possible network structures are needed (network discovery). This article introduces a novel modelling technique for network discovery (Dynamic Network Modelling or DNM) that builds on ideas from Granger Causality and Dynamic Causal Modelling introducing three key changes: (1) efficient network discovery is implemented with statistical tests on the consistency of model parameters across participants, (2) the tests take into account the magnitude and sign of each influence, and (3) variance explained in independent data is used as an absolute (rather than relative) measure of the quality of the network model. In this article, we outline the functioning of DNM, we validate DNM in simulated data for which the ground truth is known, and we report an example of its application to the investigation of influences between regions during emotion recognition, revealing top-down influences from brain regions encoding abstract representations of emotions (medial prefrontal cortex and superior temporal sulcus) onto regions engaged in the perceptual analysis of facial expressions (occipital face area and fusiform face area) when participants are asked to switch between reporting the emotional valence and the age of a face.","[Anzellotti, Stefano; Kliemann, Dorit; Saxe, Rebecca] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave,46-4017, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Jacoby, Nir] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA","Anzellotti, S (reprint author), MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave,46-4017, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.","anzellot@mit.edu","","/0000-0002-8964-6988","NIH [1R01 MH096914-01A1]; Simons Center for the Social Brain; Humboldt Foundation","This study was supported by NIH Grant 1R01 MH096914-01A1 to Prof. Rebecca Saxe.

However, there is a limited research investigating cerebellum's relationship with cognitive processes. In this study, the network of cerebellum was analyzed in order to investigate its overall organization in individuals with low and high crystallized Intelligence Quotient (IQ). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were selected from 136 subjects in resting-state from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) database and were further separated into two IQ groups composed of 69 low-IQ and 67 high-IQ subjects. Cerebellum was parcellated into 28 lobules/ROIs (per subject) using a standard cerebellum anatomical atlas. Thereafter, correlation matrices were constructed by computing Pearson's correlation coefficients between the average BOLD time-series for each pair of ROIs inside the cerebellum. By computing conventional graph metrics, small-world network properties were verified using the weighted clustering coefficient and the characteristic path length for estimating the trade-off between segregation and integration. In addition, a connectivity metric was computed for extracting the average cost per network. The concept of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) was adopted and implemented in order to avoid methodological biases in graph comparisons and retain only the strongest connections per network. Subsequently, six global and three local metrics were calculated in order to retrieve useful features concerning the characteristics of each MST. Moreover, the local metrics of degree and betweenness centrality were used to detect hubs, i.e., nodes with high importance. The computed set of metrics gave rise to extensive statistical analysis in order to examine differences between low and high-IQ groups, as well as between all possible gender-based group combinations. Our results reveal that both male and female networks have small-world properties with differences in females (especially in higher IQ females) indicative of higher neural efficiency in cerebellum. There is a trend toward the same direction in men, but without significant differences. Finally, three lobules showed maximum correlation with the median response time in low-IQ individuals, implying that there is an increased effort dedicated locally by this population in cognitive tasks.","[Pezoulas, Vasileios C.; Zervakis, Michalis] Tech Univ Crete, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Khania, Greece; [Michelogiannis, Sifis] Univ Crete, Sch Med, Neurophysiol Res Lab L Widen, Iraklion, Greece; [Klados, Manousos A.] Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Max Planck Res Grp Neuroanat & Connect, Leipzig, Germany","Pezoulas, VC (reprint author), Tech Univ Crete, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Khania, Greece.","bpezoulas@gmail.com","","Klados, Manousos/0000-0002-1629-6446","McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience at Washington University; 16 NIH Institutes and Centers [1U54MH091657]","Data were provided [in part] by the Human Connectome Project, WU-Minn Consortium (Principal Investigators: David Van Essen and Kamil Ugurbil; 1U54MH091657) funded by the 16 NIH Institutes and Centers that support the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research; and by the McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience at Washington University.","","78","5","5","5","15","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","1662-5161","","","FRONT HUM NEUROSCI","Front.

We hypothesized that trait impulsivity would differentially correlate with specific cognitive control processes. Trait impulsivity was measured by the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, which assesses motor, attention, and non-planning impulsiveness components. Cognitive control was measured by a hybrid-designed Stroop task, which distinguishes proactive and reactive control. Thirtythree participants performed the Stroop task while they were scanned by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Proactive and reactive control involved increased activity in the fronto-parietal network, and brain activity was associated with impulsivity scores. Specifically, higher motor impulsiveness was associated with a larger proactive control effect in the inferior parietal lobule and a smaller reactive control effect in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate contex. Higher attention impulsivity was associated with a smaller proactive control effect in the right DLPFC. Such a correlation pattern suggests that impulsivity trait components are attributable to different cognitive control subsystems.","[Huang, Shihua; Zhang, Wei; Chen, Yu; Zhen, Shuangju] South China Normal Univ, Sch Psychol, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Huang, Shihua; Zhang, Wei; Chen, Yu; Zhen, Shuangju] South China Normal Univ, Ctr Study Appl Psychol, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Huang, Shihua] Guangzhou Univ Chinese Med, Sch Econ & Management, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Zude] Jiangsu Normal Univ, Sch Linguist & Arts, Xuzhou, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Zude] Jiangsu Normal Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Language Competence, Xuzhou, Peoples R China","Zhang, W (reprint author), South China Normal Univ, Sch Psychol, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.; Zhang, W (reprint author), South China Normal Univ, Ctr Study Appl Psychol, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.; Zhu, ZD (reprint author), Jiangsu Normal Univ, Sch Linguist & Arts, Xuzhou, Peoples R China.; Zhu, ZD (reprint author), Jiangsu Normal Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Language Competence, Xuzhou, Peoples R China.","zhuzude@163.com; zhangwei@scnu.edu.cn","","","Natural Science Foundation of China [NSF 81671154, NSF 31571156]; MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [14YJC190007, 12YJC190040]; Scientific Research Foundation of Graduate School of South China Normal University [2012kyjj107]; Foundation for Distinguished Young Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong, China [2012WYM_0041]","This work was supported by grants from the the Natural Science Foundation of China (NSF 81671154), Natural Science Foundation of China (NSF 31571156), MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences (14YJC190007), MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences (12YJC190040), the Scientific Research Foundation of Graduate School of South China Normal University (2012kyjj107), and Foundation for Distinguished Young Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong, China (2012WYM_0041).","","51","4","4","1","6","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","SAN FRANCISCO","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","1932-6203","","","PLOS ONE","PLoS One","APR 19","2017","12","4","","","","","","","e0176102","10.1371/journal.pone.0176102","","","","14","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science & Technology - Other Topics","ES9KK","WOS:000399875600087","","DOAJ Gold, Green Published","","","2019-02-21","searchterm","searchterm_records_1001-1500.txt"

Here, in a total of 38 subjects, the functional anatomy of cross-modal semantic similarity for concrete words was determined based on a dual criterion: First, a voxelwise univariate analysis had to show significant activation during a semantic task (property verification) performed with written and spoken concrete words compared to the perceptually matched control condition. Second, in an independent dataset, in these clusters, the similarity in fMRI response pattern to two distinct entities, one presented as a written and the other as a spoken word, had to correlate with the similarity in meaning between these entities. The left ventral occipitotemporal transition zone and ventromedial temporal cortex, retrosplenial cortex, pars orbitalis bilaterally, and the left pars triangularis were all activated in the univariate contrast. Only the left pars triangularis showed a cross-modal semantic similarity effect. There was no effect of phonological nor orthographic similarity in this region. The cross-modal semantic similarity effect was confirmed by a secondary analysis in the cytoarchitectonically defined BA45. A semantic similarity effect was also present in the ventral occipital regions but only within the visual modality, and in the anterior superior temporal cortex only within the auditory modality.

Among these systems there is a lack of data from olfactory studies, which could be attributed to technical difficulties in odor delivery during scanning. The current study took advantage of an olfactometer to evaluate brain activity during the odor-smelling process. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the brain regions of the human olfactory system via fMRI brain imaging. A speculative survey was used to highlight the differences between studies conducted in healthy populations using olfactory tasks, as well as conducting literature survey in terms of the technical principles applying through these tasks in fMRI studies. Subjects and Methods: A functional map of the olfactory system that used a block design, alternating between odor and non-odor phases, was examined in 15 healthy volunteers. The general linear model was used to identify statistically significant voxels that showed activation during the activation blocks. Results: Primary and secondary olfactory regions, including the piriformis, insula, amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, caudate nucleus, inferior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and cerebellum, demonstrated significant activation in response to odor stimulation. Conclusion: Activation of the aforementioned brain areas, and the pattern of activation, is largely in accordance with previous published olfactory studies carried out in healthy individuals.","[Vedaei, Faezeh; Firouznia, Kavous] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Imam Khomeini Hosp Complex, Adv Diagnost & Intervent Radiol Res Ctr, Med Imaging Ctr, Tehran, Iran; [Oghabian, Mohammad Ali; Fakhri, Mohammad] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Neuroimaging & Anal Grp NIAG, RCMCI, Tehran, Iran; [Harirchian, Mohammad Hossein] Univ Tehran Med Sci, Imam Khomeini Hosp, Iranian Ctr Neurol Res, Tehran, Iran; [Lotfi, Younes] Univ Social Welf & Rehabil Sci, Dept Audiol, Tehran, Iran","Oghabian, MA (reprint author), Univ Tehran Med Sci, Neuroimaging & Anal Grp NIAG, RCMCI, Tehran, Iran.","oghabian@sina.tums.ac.ir","","","Iranian legal medicine organization, Iran","This work was financially supported by the Iranian legal medicine organization, Iran.","","38","1","1","1","7","KOWSAR PUBL","HOENSBROEK","PATERSWEG 22,, HOENSBROEK, LIMBURG 6431 GC, NETHERLANDS","1735-1065","2008-2711","","IRAN J RADIOL","Iran.

However, certain threat characteristics are discussed to have different or even divergent effects on pain (hypoalgesia vs hyperalgesia). In order to investigate the neurobiological basis of different threats, we compared the impact of conditioned threat (CT) vs instructed threat (IT) on pain using fMRI. In two groups, participants underwent either Pavlovian threat conditioning or an instructed threat procedure. Afterwards, in an identical test phase participants watched the same visual cues from the previous phase indicating potential threat or safety, and received painful thermal stimulation. In the test phase, pain ratings were increased in both groups under threat. Group comparisons show elevated responses in amygdala and hippocampus for pain under threat in the CT group, and higher activation of the mid-cingulate gyrus (MCC) in the IT group. Psychophysiological interaction analyses in CT demonstrated elevated connectivity of the amygdala and the insula for the comparison of pain under threat vs safety. In IT, the same comparison revealed elevated functional connectivity of the MCC and the insula. The results suggest a similar pain augmenting effect of CT and IT, which, however, seems to rely on different networks mediating the impact of threat on pain.","[Reicherts, Philipp; Wiemer, Julian; Schulz, Stefan M.; Pauli, Paul; Wieser, Matthias J.] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Psychol, Wurzburg, Germany; [Gerdes, Antje B.

These differences are reflected by an individual's social value orientation: proselfs are strategic and motivated to maximize self-interest, while prosocials are more trusting and value fairness. We hypothesize that when deciding whether or not to cooperate with a random member of a defined group, proselfs, more than prosocials, adapt their decisions based on past experiences: they 'learn' instrumentally to form a base-line expectation of reciprocity. We conducted an fMRI experiment where participants (19 proselfs and 19 prosocials) played 120 sequential prisoner's dilemmas against randomly selected, anonymous and returning partners who cooperated 60% of the time. Results indicate that cooperation levels increased over time, but that the rate of learning was steeper for proselfs than for prosocials. At the neural level, caudate and precuneus activation were more pronounced for proselfs relative to prosocials, indicating a stronger reliance on instrumental learning and self-referencing to update their trust in the cooperative strategy.","[Lambert, Bruno; Declerck, Carolyn H.; Emonds, Griet; Boone, Christophe] Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, ACED, SZ 407,Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium","Lambert, B (reprint author), Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, ACED, SZ 407,Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.","Bruno.Lambert@uantwerp.be","","","ID-BOF grant from the University of Antwerp [5340]","This research was funded by an ID-BOF grant (5340) from the University of Antwerp.","","41","1","1","2","11","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

We here examined the impact of conscientiousness on brain activation during and the cortisol response following an uncontrollable social evaluative stress task in order to test this hypothesis. Brain activation and cortisol levels were measured during an fMRI stress task, where subjects (n=86) performed cognitive tasks containing preprogrammed failure under time pressure, while being monitored by a panel of experts inducing social-evaluative threat. The degree of conscientiousness was measured using the NEO-FFI. We observed a positive correlation between conscientiousness and salivary cortisol levels in response to the stressful task in male subjects only. In male subjects conscientiousness correlated positively with activation in right amygdala and left insula, and, moreover, mediated the influence of amygdala and insula activation on cortisol output. This pattern of brain activation can be interpreted as a disadvantageous response to uncontrollable stress to which highly conscientious individuals might be predisposed. This is the first study showing the effect of conscientiousness on physiology and brain activation to an uncontrollable psychosocial stressor. Our results provide neurobiological evidence for the hypothesis that conscientiousness should not just be seen as beneficial, but rather as a trait associated with either costs or benefits depending on the extent to which one is in control of the situation.

DesignCross-sectional observational study combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with eye-tracking. Non-smokers, weekly smokers and daily smokers performed a memory task on branded and plain cigarette packs with pictorial health warnings presented in an event-related design. SettingClinical Research and Imaging Centre, University of Bristol, UK. ParticipantsNon-smokers, weekly smokers and daily smokers (n=72) were tested. After exclusions, data from 19 non-smokers, 19 weekly smokers and 20 daily smokers were analysed. MeasurementsBrain activity was assessed in whole brain analyses and in pre-specified masked analyses in the amygdala and nucleus accumbens. On-line eye-tracking during scanning recorded visual attention to health warnings. FindingsThere was no evidence for a main effect of pack type or smoking status in either the nucleus accumbens or amygdala, and this was unchanged when taking account of visual attention to health warnings. However, there was evidence for an interaction, such that we observed increased activation in the right amygdala when viewing branded as compared with plain packs among weekly smokers (P=0.003). When taking into account visual attention to health warnings, we observed higher levels of activation in the visual cortex in response to plain packaging compared with branded packaging of cigarettes (P=0.020). ConclusionsBased on functional magnetic resonance imaging and eye-tracking data, health warnings appear to be more salient on plain' cigarette packs than branded packs.","[Maynard, Olivia M.; Brooks, Jonathan C.

Indeed, research shows that social interaction facilitates lexical and phonological development at the early stages of child language acquisition. It is not clear, however, whether the relationship between social interaction and learning applies to adult second language acquisition of syntactic rules. Does learning second language syntactic rules through social interactions with a native speaker or without such interactions impact behavior and the brain? The current study aims to answer this question. Adult Japanese participants learned a new foreign language, Japanese sign language (JSL), either through a native deaf signer or via DVDs. Neural correlates of acquiring new linguistic knowledge were investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The participants in each group were indistinguishable in terms of their behavioral data after the instruction. The fMRI data, however, revealed significant differences in the neural activities between two groups. Significant activations in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) were found for the participants who learned JSL through interactions with the native signer. In contrast, no cortical activation change in the left IFG was found for the group who experienced the same visual input for the same duration via the DVD presentation. Given that the left IFG is involved in the syntactic processing of language, spoken or signed, learning through social interactions resulted in an fMRI signature typical of native speakers: activation of the left IFG. Thus, broadly speaking, availability of communicative interaction is necessary for second language acquisition and this results in observed changes in the brain.","[Yusa, Noriaki] Miyagi Gakuin Womens Univ, Dept English, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Kim, Jungho] Kyoto Womens Univ, Dept Foreign Languages, Kyoto, Japan; [Koizumi, Masatoshi] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Arts & Letters, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Sugiura, Motoaki; Kawashima, Ryuta] Tohoku Univ, Inst Dev Aging & Canc, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan","Yusa, N (reprint author), Miyagi Gakuin Womens Univ, Dept English, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.","n_yusa@me.com","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [20020022, 25580133, 16K13266]; Special Research Grant from Miyagi Gakuin Women's University","This work was supported in part by the Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas (#20020022, Noriaki Yusa, PI), Challenging Exploratory Research (#25580133, 16K13266, Noriaki Yusa, PI) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, and the 2010 Special Research Grant from Miyagi Gakuin Women's University (Noriaki Yusa, PI).","","82","2","2","4","14","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","PO BOX 110, EPFL INNOVATION PARK, BUILDING I, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND","1662-5161","","","FRONT HUM NEUROSCI","Front.

However, its precise function in this network remains unclear. It has recently been proposed that the dmPFC is involved in high-level abstract (i.e., categorical) identification or construction of both social and non-social stimuli, referred to as ""high construal."" This was based on the observation of greater activation in the dmPFC shared by a high construal social condition (trait inference based on visually presented behavior) and a high construal non-social condition (categorization of visually presented objects) vs. matched low construal conditions (visual description of the same pictures). However, dmPFC activation has been related to task contexts requiring responses based on self-guided generation of mental content or decisions as compared to responses more directly determined by the experimental context (e.g., free vs. rule-governed choice). The previously reported dmPFC activity may reflect differences in task constraint (i.e., the extent to which the task context guided the process) confounded with the construal manipulation. Therefore, in the present study, we manipulated construal level and constraint independently, while participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). As before, participants visually described (low level construal) or categorized (high level construal) pictures of objects. Orthogonal to this, the description or categorization task had to be performed on either one object (low constraint) or on two objects simultaneously (high constraint), limiting the number of possible responses. Statistical analysis revealed common greater activation in both high construal conditions (high and low constraint) than in their low construal counterparts, replicating the influence of construal level on dmPFC activation (greater involvement in high than low construal), but no influence of constraint. In line with previous proposals and earlier work, we suggest that the dmPFC is involved in high-construal abstraction across different domains.","[Baetens, Kris L. M.

Two levels of neuroticism assessments were conducted with 47 female subjects, who were required to attend to, suppress emotion displays to, or cognitively reappraise the meanings of negative images. The results showed reduced emotional experience and bilateral amygdala activation during reappraisal, and this regulation effect is unaffected by individual differences in neuroticism and its subdimensions. By contrast, the emotion downregulation effect of suppression in the right amygdala is compromised with increasing self-consciousness but not overall neuroticism dimension. This association holds robust after controlling the potential contribution of habitual suppression. Moreover, the psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis revealed that self-consciousness predicts weaker functional coupling of the right amygdala to supplementary motor area and putamen during expressive suppression, two regions mediating the control and execution of motor actions. These findings suggest that self-consciousness predicts increased difficulty in emotional regulation using expressive suppression; and that the heterogeneous nature of trait neuroticism needs to be considered in exploring the association of neuroticism and emotion regulation.","[Chen, Shengdong; Chen, Changming; Yang, Jiemin; Yuan, Jiajin] Southwest Univ, Fac Psychol, Lab Affect Cognit & Regulat ACRLAB, Minist Educ SWU,Key Lab Cognit & Personal, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Changming] Xinyang Normal Univ, Sch Educ Sci, Xinyang, Peoples R China","Yang, JM; Yuan, JJ (reprint author), Southwest Univ, Fac Psychol, Lab Affect Cognit & Regulat ACRLAB, Minist Educ SWU,Key Lab Cognit & Personal, Chongqing, Peoples R China.","yangjiemin85@126.com; yuanjiajin168@126.com","Chen, Shengdong/G-1359-2018","Chen, Shengdong/0000-0002-1193-5931; Yuan, Jiajin/0000-0002-5630-2230","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31371042, 31400906]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 31371042, 31400906).","","78","4","4","3","45","NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP","LONDON","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","2045-2322","","","SCI REP-UK","Sci Rep","MAR 8","2017","7","","","","","","","","117","10.1038/s41598-017-00073-3","","","","11","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science & Technology - Other Topics","FX2AZ","WOS:000425860900004","28273918","DOAJ Gold, Green Published","","","2019-02-21","searchterm","searchterm_records_1001-1500.txt"

It has been argued that each fundamental motive is activated by cues pertaining to threats or opportunities linked with each fundamental motive, and may be based on qualitatively different cognitive and neural systems. Steroid hormones influence specific neural systems and consumer behaviors rooted in diverse fundamental motives. By taking steroid sex hormones as examples of internal cues, we suggested that at least three fundamental motives (status attainment, mate attraction, and mate retention) may be explained by common cognitive and neural mechanisms.

The results showed that artistic creativity was significantly negatively associated with the regional GMV of the supplementary motor area (SMA) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In contrast, scientific creativity was significantly positively correlated with the regional GMV of the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and left inferior occipital gyrus (IOG). Overall, artistic creativity was associated with the salience network (SN), whereas scientific creativity was associated with the executive attention network and semantic processing.

However, recent work suggests that this dACC-AI matrix may index any socially pertinent information. We directly tested the hypothesis that the dACC-AI would respond to cues of both inclusion and exclusion, using a novel social feedback fMRI paradigm in a population-derived sample of adolescents. We show that the dACC and left AI are commonly activated by feedback cues of inclusion and exclusion.

EGE activated nodes of salience (SN), defaultmode (DMN) and frontoparietal control (FPCN) networks. Component processes implemented by these networks were established by investigating their functional associations, activation dynamics and integration. SN activation correlated with subjective affect, withmidbrain nodes exclusively distinguishing between positive and negative affect intensity, showing dynamics consistent generation of core affect. Dorsomedial DMN, together with ventral anterior insula, formed a pathway supportingmultiple generationmethods, with activation dynamics suggesting it is involved in the generation of elaborated experiential representations. SN and DMN both coupled to left frontal FPCN which in turn was associated with both subjective affect and representation formation, consistent with FPCN supporting the executive coordination of the generation process.

Being able to identify at-risk adolescents before they initiate heavy alcohol use could have important clinical and public health implications; however, few investigations have explored individual-level precursors of adolescent substance use. This prospective investigation used machine learning with demographic, neurocognitive, and neuroimaging data in substance-naive adolescents to identify predictors of alcohol use initiation by age 18. Method: Participants (N=137) were healthy substancenaive adolescents (ages 12-14) who underwent neuropsychological testing and structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI and fMRI), and then were followed annually. By age 18, 70 youths (51%) initiated moderate to heavy alcohol use, and 67 remained nonusers. Random forest classification models identified the most important predictors of alcohol use from a large set of demographic, neuropsychological, sMRI, and fMRI variables. Results: Random forest models identified 34 predictors contributing to alcohol use by age 18, including several demographic and behavioral factors (being male, higher socioeconomic status, early dating, more externalizing behaviors, positive alcohol expectancies), worse executive functioning, and thinner cortices and less brain activation in diffusely distributed regions of the brain. Conclusions: Incorporating a mix of demographic, behavioral, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging data may be the best strategy for identifying youths at risk for initiating alcohol use during adolescence. The identified risk factors will be useful for alcohol prevention efforts and in research to address brain mechanisms that may contribute to early drinking.","[Tapert, Susan F.] Med Univ South Carolina, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Addict Sci Div, Charleston, SC 29425 USA; Stanford Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Psychiat, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; VA San Diego Healthcare Syst, San Diego, CA USA; San Diego State Univ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; Univ Calif San Diego, Joint Doctoral Program Clin Psychol, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; Laureate Inst Brain Res, Tulsa, OK USA","Tapert, SF (reprint author), Med Univ South Carolina, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Addict Sci Div, Charleston, SC 29425 USA.","stapert@ucsd.edu","","Paulus, Martin/0000-0002-0825-3606","National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) [R01 AA13419, U01 AA021692]; National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) [U01 DA041089]; NIDA [K12 DA031794, T32 DA031098, R01 DA016663, P20 DA027843]; NIAAA [K23 AA025399, T32 AA013525]","Supported by National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) grants R01 AA13419 and U01 AA021692 and National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) grant U01 DA041089 to Dr. Tapert; by NIDA grant K12 DA031794 and NIAAA grant K23 AA025399 to Dr. Squeglia; by NIDA grant T32 DA031098 to Dr. McKenna; by NIAAA grant T32 AA013525 to Ms. Nguyen-Louie; and by NIDA grants R01 DA016663 and P20 DA027843 to Dr. Paulus.","","49","18","18","9","30","AMER PSYCHIATRIC PUBLISHING, INC","ARLINGTON","1000 WILSON BOULEVARD, STE 1825, ARLINGTON, VA 22209-3901 USA","0002-953X","1535-7228","","AM J PSYCHIAT","Am.

Previous studies suggest that adults with Tourette syndrome (TS) can respond unconventionally on tasks involving social cognition. We therefore hypothesized that these patients would exhibit different neural responses to healthy controls in response to emotionally salient expressions of human eyes. Method. Twenty-five adults with TS and 25 matched healthy controls were scanned using fMRI during the standard version of the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task which requires mental state judgements, and a novel comparison version requiring judgements about age. Results. During prompted mental state recognition, greater activity was apparent in TS within left orbitofrontal cortex, posterior cingulate, right amygdala and right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), while reduced activity was apparent in regions including left inferior parietal cortex. Age judgement elicited greater activity in TS within precuneus, medial prefrontal and temporal regions involved in mentalizing. The interaction between group and task revealed differential activity in areas including right inferior frontal gyrus. Task-related activity in the TPJ covaried with global ratings of the urge to tic. Conclusions. While recognizing mental states, adults with TS exhibit greater activity than controls in brain areas involved in the processing of negative emotion, in addition to reduced activity in regions associated with the attribution of agency. In addition, increased recruitment of areas involved in mental state reasoning is apparent in these patients when mentalizing is not a task requirement.

Research has suggested that tactile judgment of speed is influenced by physical properties of the moving object, though the neural mechanisms underlying this process remain poorly understood. In the present study, functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate brain networks that may be involved in tactile speed classification and how such networks may be affected by an object's texture. Participants were asked to classify the speed of 2-D raised dot patterns passing under their right middle finger. Activity in the parietal operculum, insula, and inferior and superior frontal gyri was positively related to the motion speed of dot patterns. Activity in the postcentral gyrus and superior parietal lobule was sensitive to dot periodicity. Psycho-physiological interaction (PPI) analysis revealed that dot periodicity modulated functional connectivity between the parietal operculum (related to speed) and postcentral gyrus (related to dot periodicity). These results suggest that texture-sensitive activity in the primary somatosensory cortex and superior parietal lobule influences brain networks associated with tactually-extracted motion speed. Such effects may be related to the influence of surface texture on tactile speed judgment.","[Yang, Jiajia; Yu, Yinghua; Araki, Yuta; Wu, Jinglong] Okayama Univ, Grad Sch Nat Sci & Technol, Div Med Bioengn, Okayama 7008530, Japan; [Yang, Jiajia; Yu, Yinghua] NIMH, Sect Funct Imaging Methods, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Kitada, Ryo] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, 14 Nanyang Dr, Singapore 637332, Singapore; [Kitada, Ryo; Sadato, Norihiro] Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Div Cerebral Integrat, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan; [Kitada, Ryo; Sadato, Norihiro] Grad Univ Adv Studies, SOKENDAI, Dept Physiol Sci, Hayama 2400193, Japan; [Kochiyama, Takanori] ATR Brain Act Imaging Ctr, Seika Cho, Hiroshima 6190288, Japan; [Makita, Kai] Hiroshima Univ, Inst Biomed & Hlth Sci, Hiroshima 730, Japan; [Wu, Jinglong] Minist Educ, Key Lab Biomimet Robots & Syst, Beijing, Peoples R China","Wu, JL (reprint author), Okayama Univ, Grad Sch Nat Sci & Technol, Div Med Bioengn, Okayama 7008530, Japan.; Kitada, R (reprint author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, 14 Nanyang Dr, Singapore 637332, Singapore.; Kitada, R (reprint author), Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Div Cerebral Integrat, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan.; Kitada, R (reprint author), Grad Univ Adv Studies, SOKENDAI, Dept Physiol Sci, Hayama 2400193, Japan.; Wu, JL (reprint author), Minist Educ, Key Lab Biomimet Robots & Syst, Beijing, Peoples R China.","ryo.kitada@gmail.com; wu@mech.okayama-u.ac.jp","","Kochiyama, Takanori/0000-0002-4023-0674","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [23700326]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan [25135734, 16H01680]; MEXT of Japan [21220005, 15H01846]; JSPS of Japan [25249026, 25303013, 24686034]","The authors declare no competing financial interests.

A person's apparent confidence in the likely reward of an action, for instance, makes qualities of their evidence, not observed directly, socially accessible. This strategy is computationally distinguished from associative learning methods that rely on direct observation, by its use of inference from indirect evidence. In twenty-three healthy human subjects, we isolated effects of first-hand experience, other people's choices, and the mediating effect of their confidence, on decision-making and neural correlates of value within ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Value derived from first-hand experience and other people's choices (regardless of confidence) were indiscriminately represented across vmPFC. However, value computed from agent choices weighted by their associated confidence was represented with specificity for ventromedial area 10. This pattern corresponds to shifts of connectivity and overlapping cognitive processes along a posterior-anterior vmPFC axis. Task behavior and self-reported self-reliance for decision-making in other social contexts correlated. The tendency to conform in other social contexts corresponded to increased activation in cortical regions previously shown to respond to social conflict in proportion to subsequent conformity (Campbell-Meiklejohn et al., 2010). The tendency to self-monitor predicted a selectively enhanced response to accordance with others in the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ). The findings anatomically decompose vmPFC value representations according to computational requirements and provide biological insight into the social transmission of preference and reassurance gained from the confidence of others.","[Campbell-Meiklejohn, Daniel] Univ Sussex, Sch Psychol, Pevensey Bldg, Brighton BN1 9QH, E Sussex, England; [Simonsen, Arndis; Frith, Chris D.] Aarhus Univ, Sch Culture & Soc, Interacting Minds Ctr, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; [Frith, Chris D.] UCL, Wellcome Trust Ctr Neuroimaging, London WC1N 3BG, England; [Daw, Nathaniel D.] Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Daw, Nathaniel D.] Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA","Campbell-Meiklejohn, D (reprint author), Univ Sussex, Sch Psychol, Pevensey Bldg, Brighton BN1 9QH, E Sussex, England.","daniel.cm@sussex.ac.uk","","Campbell-Meiklejohn, Daniel/0000-0002-8916-265X; Frith, Chris/0000-0002-8665-0690; Simonsen, Arndis/0000-0002-5044-9936","Danish Council for Independent Research: Medical Sciences (Sapere Aude Grant); Lundbeck Foundation; James S.

Behavioral, eye tracking, and neuroimaging research has identified associations between PSI and implicit hypervigilance for social threats. Additionally, selective executive dysfunction has been evidenced by reduced prepotent response inhibition in social Stroop and dichotic listening tasks. Given that PSI is associated with pre-attentional processes, PSI may also be related to altered resting-state functional connectivity (Fe) in the brain. Therefore, we conducted the first resting-state fMRI FC study of PSI in healthy young adults. Five-minute resting-state scans were obtained from 55 participants (31 females). Analyses revealed robust associations between PSI and increased brain-wide FC in areas encompassing the right central operculum and right supramarginal gyros, and these associations were not explained by depressive symptomatology, objective isolation, or demographics. Further analyses revealed that PSI was associated with increased FC between several nodes of the cingulo-opercular network, a network known to underlie the maintenance of tonic alertness. These regions encompassed the bilateral insula/frontoparietal opercula and ACC/pre-SMA. In contrast, FC between the cingulo-opercular network and right middle/superior frontal gyrus was reduced, a finding associated with diminished executive function in prior literature. We suggest that, in PSI, increased within-network cingulo-opercular FC may be associated with hypervigilance to social threat, whereas reduced right middle/superior frontal gyrus FC to the cingulo-opercular network may be associated with diminished impulse control.","[Layden, Elliot A.; Cacioppo, John T.] Univ Chicago, Dept Psychol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Layden, Elliot A.; Cacioppo, John T.; Cacioppo, Stephanie] Univ Chicago, Ctr Cognit & Social Neurosci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Cacioppo, Stephanie] Univ Chicago, Div Biol Sci, Pritzker Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Cappa, Stefano F.; Canessa, Nicola] Scuola Univ Super IUSS, NEtS Ctr, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Cappa, Stefano F.; Dodich, Alessandra; Canessa, Nicola] IRCCS Osped San Raffaele, Div Neurosci, Cognit Neurosci Unit, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Falini, Andrea] IRCCS Osped San Raffaele, Dept Neuroradiol, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Falini, Andrea] IRCCS Osped San Raffaele, CERMAC, Div Neurosci, I-20132 Milan, Italy","Layden, EA (reprint author), CCSN, 940 E 57th St,4th Floor,Room 427, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.","elayden@uchicago.edu","Canessa, Nicola/K-3223-2016","Canessa, Nicola/0000-0002-0179-6384; falini, andrea/0000-0002-1461-8755; Layden, Elliot/0000-0002-7365-1985","MIUR grant [PRIN 2010XPMFW4_008]","This work was supported by a MIUR grant (PRIN 2010XPMFW4_008; I meccanismi neurocognitivi alla base delle interazioni sociali) to Stefano F.

To reveal the neural mechanisms underlying this adaptive process, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed on 27 male subjects during virtual partner choice tasks involving a dance-partner choice or a part-time job choice. Following the evaluation of a rival, the subjects chose a partner either in the face of competition with a rival (reciprocal choice condition) or during no competition (nonreciprocal condition). Irrespective of the type of partner choice situation, the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) were specifically activated during reciprocal partner choice. The PCC was also activated during the evaluation of a rival relative to the self, which indicates the involvement of this region in the processing of one's own market price. Activation in the right TPJ was related to the individual tendency to avoid choosing a higher-value candidate when the rival-value was high in the reciprocal choice condition, which indicates that this region plays a role in market-adaptive strategy. Taken together with extant anatomical knowledge, the two-component neurobiological structure underlying the adaptive mechanism of partner choice identified in this study seems to represent the hierarchical evolution of the human socio-cognitive system.

The current study utilized fMRI to identify (a) regions uniquely involved in encoding the goal of others' actions, and (b) to test whether these goal understanding processes draw more strongly on regions involved in encoding object semantics or movement kinematics. Participants watched sequences of instrumental actions while attending to either the actions' goal (goal task), the movements performed (movement task) or the objects used (object task). The results confirmed, first, a unique role of the inferior frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus and medial frontal gyrus in action goal understanding. Second, they show for the first time that activation in the goal task overlaps directly with object-but not movement-related activation. Moreover, subsequent parametric analyses revealed that movement-related regions become activated only when goals are unclear, or observers have little action experience. In contrast to motor theories of action understanding, these data suggest that objects-rather than movement kinematics-carry the key information about others' actions. Kinematic information is additionally recruited when goals are ambiguous or unfamiliar.","[Nicholson, Toby; Roser, Matt; Bach, Patric] Univ Plymouth, Sch Psychol, Drake Circus, Devon, England","Nicholson, T (reprint author), Univ Plymouth, Sch Psychol, Drake Circus, Devon, England.","toby.nicholson@plymouth.ac.uk","","Bach, Patric/0000-0003-4493-2080","""One step ahead: Prediction of other people's behavior in healthy and autistic individuals"" [ES/J019178/1]; Plymouth University grant; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J019178/1]","This study was funded by http://www. esrc.ac.uk/, http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/project/2ABED193-1046-4849-9E15-4098E8549C8C, grant number: ES/J019178/1, ""One step ahead: Prediction of other people's behavior in healthy and autistic individuals.""

To explore the nature of this affective impact at an extremely basic textual level, we collected ratings on eight different general affective meaning scalesvalence, arousal, friendliness, sadness, spitefulness, poeticity, onomatopoeia, and likingfor 57 German poems (die verteidigung der wolfe) which the contemporary author H. M. Enzensberger had labeled as either friendly, sad, or spiteful. Following Jakobson's (1960) view on the vivid interplay of hierarchical text levels, we used multiple regression analyses to explore the specific influences of affective features from three different text levels (sublexical, lexical, and inter-lexical) on the perceived general affective meaning of the poems using three types of predictors: (1) Lexical predictor variables capturing the mean valence and arousal potential of words; (2) Inter-lexical predictors quantifying peaks, ranges, and dynamic changes within the lexical affective content; (3) Sublexical measures of basic affective tone according to sound-meaning correspondences at the sublexical level (see Aryani et al., 2016). We find the lexical predictors to account for a major amount of up to 50% of the variance in affective ratings. Moreover, inter-lexical and sublexical predictors account for a large portion of additional variance in the perceived general affective meaning. Together, the affective properties of all used textual features account for 43-70% of the variance in the affective ratings and still for 23-48% of the variance in the more abstract aesthetic ratings. In sum, our approach represents a novel method that successfully relates a prominent part of variance in perceived general affective meaning in this corpus of German poems to quantitative estimates of affective properties of textual components at the sublexical, lexical, and inter-lexical level.","[Ullrich, Susann; Aryani, Arash; Kraxenberger, Maria; Jacobs, Arthur M.; Conrad, Markus] Free Univ Berlin, Languages Emot, Berlin, Germany; [Ullrich, Susann; Aryani, Arash; Jacobs, Arthur M.] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Expt & Neurocognit Psychol, Berlin, Germany; [Kraxenberger, Maria] Max Planck Inst Empir Aesthet, Frankfurt, Germany; [Jacobs, Arthur M.] Free Univ Berlin, Dahlem Inst Neuroimaging Emot, Berlin, Germany; [Conrad, Markus] Univ La Laguna, Dept Cognit Social & Org Psychol, San Cristobal De Laguna, Spain","Ullrich, S (reprint author), Free Univ Berlin, Languages Emot, Berlin, Germany.; Ullrich, S (reprint author), Free Univ Berlin, Dept Expt & Neurocognit Psychol, Berlin, Germany.","susann_ullrich@msn.com","Conrad, Markus/N-3184-2014","Conrad, Markus/0000-0003-1335-437X","German Research Foundation (DFG) via the Cluster of Excellence ""Languages of Emotion"" at the Freie Universitat Berlin [410]; Freie Universitat Berlin","This research was funded through the grant 410 ""Sound physiognomy in language organization, processing and production"" to MC from the German Research Foundation (DFG) via the Cluster of Excellence ""Languages of Emotion"" at the Freie Universitat Berlin.

This theory is an extension of network theory that has been successfully applied to the modeling of dynamic processes in economics, social sciences, and engineering article but it has not been adopted to a great extent within network neuroscience. The objective of this article is twofold: (i) to present a detailed description of the central tenets of temporal network theory and describe its measures, and; (ii) to apply these measures to a resting-state fMRI dataset to illustrate their utility.

During an X-ray luggage-screening task, participants accepted or rejected good or bad advice from either the human or machine agent framed as experts with manipulated reliability (high miss rate). We showed that the machine-agent group decreased their advice utilization compared to the human-agent group and these differences in behaviors during advice utilization could be accounted for by high expectations of reliable advice and changes in attention allocation due to miss errors. Brain areas involved with the salience and mentalizing networks, as well as sensory processing involved with attention, were recruited during the task and the advice utilization network consisted of attentional modulation of sensory information with the lingual gyrus as the driver during the decision phase and the fusiform gyrus as the driver during the feedback phase.

As such, the potential role of more deliberate control over empathic responses has frequently been overlooked. The present fMRI study evaluated the role of such deliberate control in empathic concern by examining the extent to which a sample of offenders recruited through probation/parole could voluntarily modulate their neural activity to another person in pain. Offenders were asked to either passively view pictures of other people in painful or non-painful situations, or to actively modulate their level of concern for the person in pain. During passive viewing of painful versus non-painful pictures, offenders showed minimal neural activity in regions previously linked to empathy for pain (e.g., dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral insula). However, when instructed to try to increase their concern for the person in pain, offenders demonstrated significant increases within these regions. These findings are consistent with recent theories of empathy as motivational in nature, and suggest that limitations in empathic concern may include a motivational component.","[Arbuckle, Nathan L.; Shane, Matthew S.] Univ Ontario, Inst Technol, Dept Forens Psychol, Oshawa, ON, Canada; [Arbuckle, Nathan L.] Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Shane, Matthew S.] Mind Res Network, Clin Affect Neurosci Lab, Albuquerque, NM USA","Arbuckle, NL (reprint author), Univ Ontario, Inst Technol, 2 Simcoe St S, Oshawa, ON L1H 7L9, Canada.","nathan.arbuckle@uoit.ca","","","National Institute on Drug Abuse [1R01DA026932, 1R21DA029464, 1R21DA027149]; National Institute of Mental Health [1R21MH086880]","This work was supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse: [grant numbers 1R01DA026932, 1R21DA029464, 1R21DA027149 to M.S.]; and the National Institute of Mental Health [grant number 1R21MH086880 to M.S.].","","20","2","2","0","5","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1747-0919","1747-0927","","SOC NEUROSCI-UK","Soc.

Although the underlying mechanism remains elusive, one possibility is that TP acts as domain-general hub integrating socioemotional information. To test this, 26 participants were presented with 60 empathy-evoking film clips during fMRI scanning. The film clips were preceded by a linguistic sad or neutral context and half of the clips were accompanied by sad music. In line with its hypothesized role, TP was involved in the processing of sad context and furthermore tracked participants' empathic concern. To examine the neuromodulatory impact of TP, we applied nonlinear dynamic causal modeling to a multisensory integration network from previous work consisting of superior temporal gyrus (STG), fusiform gyrus (FG), and amygdala, which was extended by an additional node in the TP. Bayesian model comparison revealed a gating of STG and TP on fusiform-amygdalar coupling and an increase of TP to FG connectivity during the integration of contextual information. Moreover, these backward projections were strengthened by emotional music. The findings indicate that during social cognition, TP integrates information from different modalities and top-down modulates lower-level perceptual areas in the ventral visual stream as a function of integration demands.","[Pehrs, Corinna; Schlochtermeier, Lorna H.; Jacobs, Arthur M.; Kuchinke, Lars] Cluster Excellence Languages Emot, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Pehrs, Corinna; Schlochtermeier, Lorna H.; Jacobs, Arthur M.; Kuchinke, Lars] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Educ & Psychol, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Pehrs, Corinna; Schlochtermeier, Lorna H.; Jacobs, Arthur M.; Kuchinke, Lars] Dahlem Inst Neuroimaging Emot, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Zaki, Jamil] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kuchinke, Lars] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Psychol Expt Psychol & Methods, D-44801 Bochum, Germany; [Koelsch, Stefan] Univ Bergen, Dept Biol & Med Psychol, N-5009 Bergen, Norway","Koelsch, S (reprint author), Univ Bergen, Dept Biol & Med Psychol, N-5009 Bergen, Norway.; Pehrs, C (reprint author), Free Univ Berlin, Cluster Languages Emot, Habelschwerdter Allee 45, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.","koelsch@cbs.mpg.de","","","Excellence Initiative of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [EXC 302]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [JA 823/4-2]","This work was supported by Excellence Initiative of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft Grant EXC 302 and from a project of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (JA 823/4-2).","","98","15","15","3","22","OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1047-3211","1460-2199","","CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

We scanned participants while they lied or told the truth about either their personal experiences (episodic memories) or personal beliefs. Regions in the frontal and parietal cortex showed higher activation when participants lied compared with when they were telling the truth, regardless of whether they were asked about their past experiences or opinions. In contrast, lie-related activation in the right temporal pole, precuneus and the right amygdala differed by the content of the lie.

Participants from the Swedish Twin Registry were 2,279 men and 3,152 women in the ages 27 to 54. Cultural achievement was measured with the Creative Achievement Questionnaire (CAQ) in which participants estimate their achievement in the domains writing, music, visual arts, theater, and dance on a 7-point scale. Alexithymia was measured with the Toronto Alexithymia Score (TAS 20). In sex separated, age, and education-adjusted multivariate analyses, nonpractitioners, amateurs, and professionals in the 5 different CAQ domains were compared with regard to alexithymia scores. For both men and women, achievement in writing and music contributed statistically and independently of one another to a low alexithymia score. In addition, achievement in visual arts contributed independently to low alexithymia score in men and achievement in theatre to low alexithymia score in women. Total creative achievement was calculated as a sum score across domains, and the distribution divided into tertile groups. These groups were compared with regard to alexithymia scores. Large tertile differences were found in both sexes. The results show differences between modalities and cumulative effects of multiple creative achievements.","[Lennartsson, Anna-Karin] Karolinska Inst, Ctr Psychiat Res, Stockholm, Sweden; [Horwitz, Eva Bojner] Uppsala Univ, Uppsala, Sweden; [Horwitz, Eva Bojner; Theorell, Tores; Ullen, Fredrik] Karolinska Inst, Stockholm, Sweden; [Theorell, Tores] Stockholm Univ, Stress Res Inst, Stockholm, Sweden","Lennartsson, AK (reprint author), Karolinska Inst, Dept Clin Neurosci, Ctr Psychiat Res, 18A,Floor 5, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden.","anna-karin.lennartsson@ki.se","","","Swedish Tercentenary Fund [M11-0451:1]; Riddargardskliniken; Sven and Dagmar Salen Foundation","This research was supported financially by the Swedish Tercentenary Fund (M11-0451:1), by Riddargardskliniken and by the Sven and Dagmar Salen Foundation, which is gratefully acknowledged.","","41","0","0","0","2","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1040-0419","1532-6934","","CREATIVITY RES J","Creativ.

According to the 'Big Two' model of impression formation, competence traits are the other major dimension when we judge others. The current study explored the neural representation of competence traits by using an fMRI repetition suppression paradigm, which is a rapid reduction of neuronal responses upon repeated presentation of the same implied trait. Participants had to infer an agent's trait from brief behavioral descriptions that implied a competence trait. In each trial, the critical target sentence was preceded by a prime sentence that implied the same or opposite competence-related trait, or no trait. The results revealed robust repetition suppression from prime to target in the vmPFC and precuneus during trait conditions. Critically, the suppression effect was much stronger after being primed with a similar and opposite competence trait compared with a trait-irrelevant prime. This suppression pattern was found nowhere else in the brain.

A second group of occipital and adjacent posterior cortical regions showed a pattern of diminishing responses with repeated presentations of affective images but not for neutral images, and also plateaued to activation levels above baseline for all image categories. A third group involved bilateral frontopolar areas and the precuneus and exhibited a novel, non-monotonic response pattern. Activity was low on the first presentation, peaked upon the second presentation (first repetition) and subsequently diminished.

A recent neurobiological model of higher-order language processing (Bornkessel-Schlesewsky et al., 2015) posits that temporal receptive windows in the dorsal auditory stream provide the basis for a hierarchically organized predictive coding architecture (Friston and Kiebel, 2009). In this stream, a nested set of internal models generates time-based (""when"") predictions for upcoming input at different linguistic levels (sounds, words, sentences, discourse). Here, we used naturalistic stories to test the hypothesis that multi-sentence, discourse-level predictions are processed in the dorsal auditory stream, yielding attenuated BOLD responses for highly predicted versus less strongly predicted language input. The results were as hypothesized: discourse-related cues, such as passive voice, which effect a higher predictability of remention for a character at a later point within a story, led to attenuated BOLD responses for auditory input of high versus low predictability within the dorsal auditory stream, specifically in the inferior parietal lobule, middle frontal gyrus, and dorsal parts of the inferior frontal gyrus, among other areas. Additionally, we found effects of content-related (""what"") predictions in ventral regions. These findings provide novel evidence that hierarchical predictive coding extends to discourse-level processing in natural language. Importantly, they ground language processing on a hierarchically organized predictive network, as a common underlying neurobiological basis shared with other brain functions.","[Kandylaki, Katerina Danae; Nagels, Arne; Kircher, Tilo] Univ Marburg, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, D-35039 Marburg, Germany; [Kandylaki, Katerina Danae; Wiese, Richard] Univ Marburg, Dept German Linguist, D-35032 Marburg, Germany; [Kandylaki, Katerina Danae] Imperial Coll London, Dept Bioengn, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Tune, Sarah] Univ Lubeck, Inst Psychol 1, D-23562 Lubeck, Germany; [Schlesewsky, Matthias; Bornkessel-Schlesewsky, Ina] Univ South Australia, Sch Psychol Social Work & Social Policy, Cognit Neurosci Lab, Magill Campus, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia","Kandylaki, KD (reprint author), Imperial Coll London, Bioengn, RSM Bldg,South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England.","a.kandylaki@imperial.ac.uk","","Tune, Sarah/0000-0001-9022-9965; Kircher, Tilo/0000-0002-2514-2625; Kandylaki, Katerina Danae/0000-0001-7831-4913; Wiese, Richard/0000-0001-7333-1589","University of Marburg; state of Hesse; Wellcome Trust Grant [108295/Z/15/Z]","This work was supported by the University of Marburg within the Exzellenz Initiative (ExInit) PhD scholarships and the state of Hesse within the LOEWE Research Focus: Exploring Fundamental Linguistic Categories.

In addition, no studies have investigated whether there is any functional connectivity between the medial frontal cortex and other brain regions in more skilled action anticipation. Therefore, the present study aimed to re-investigate how the medial frontal cortex is involved in more skilled action anticipation by circumventing the limitations of previous research and to investigate that the medial frontal cortex functionally connected with other brain regions involved in action processing in more skilled action anticipation. To this end, professional badminton players and novices were asked to anticipate the landing position of the shuttlecock while watching badminton match videos or to judge the gender of the players in the matches. The video clips ended right at the point that the shuttlecock and the racket came into contact to reduce the effect of information about the trajectory of the shuttlecock. Novices who lacked training and watching experience were recruited for the control group to reduce the effect of sport-related experience on the medial frontal cortex. Blood oxygenation level-dependent activation was assessed by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging. Compared to novices, badminton players exhibited stronger activation in the left medial frontal cortex during action anticipation and greater functional connectivity between left medial frontal cortex and some other brain regions (e.g., right posterior cingulate cortex). Therefore, the present study supports the position that the medial frontal cortex plays a role in more skilled action anticipation and that there is a specific brain network for more skilled action anticipation that involves right posterior cingulate cortex, right fusiform gyrus, right inferior parietal lobule, left insula and particularly, and left medial frontal cortex.","[Xu, Huan; Jin, Hua] Tianjin Normal Univ, Key Res Base Humanities & Social Sci, Ctr Cooperat Innovat Assessment & Promot, Natl Mental Hlth,Acad Psychol & Behav,Minist Educ, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Wang, Pin] Guangdong Vocat Coll Environm Protect Engn, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Ye, Zhuo'er] 21cn Com, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Di, Xin] New Jersey Inst Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Xu, Guiping] Guangdong Univ Educ, Sch Educ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Mo, Lei] South China Normal Univ, Sch Psychol, Ctr Studies Psychol Applicat, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Lin, Huiyan] Guangdong Univ Finance, Inst Appl Psychol, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Rao, Hengyi] Univ Penn, Dept Neurol, Ctr Funct Neuroimaging, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Jin, H (reprint author), Tianjin Normal Univ, Key Res Base Humanities & Social Sci, Ctr Cooperat Innovat Assessment & Promot, Natl Mental Hlth,Acad Psychol & Behav,Minist Educ, Tianjin, Peoples R China.","jennyjin2@163.com","Di, Xin/B-2009-2009","Di, Xin/0000-0002-2422-9016","National Nature Science Foundation of China [31471003]","This research was supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China Grants (31471003).

This study investigates the neural substrates of a replicated facilitatory effect of anxiety on sustained attention and response inhibition. This effect consisted of improved performance on the Sustained Attention to Response Task (a Go-NoGo task consisting of 91% Go and 9% NoGo trials) in threat (unpredictable electrical shock) vs safe (no shock) conditions. This study uses the same experimental design with fMRI and relies on an event-related analysis of BOLD signal changes. Findings reveal that threat-related cognitive facilitation (improved NoGo accuracy) is associated with greater activation of a right-lateralized frontoparietal group of regions previously implicated in sustained attention and response inhibition. Moreover, these same regions show decreased activation in the Go trials preceding NoGo errors. During NoGo trials, striatal activity is also greater in the threat vs safe condition, consistent with the notion of enhanced inhibitory processing under threat. These findings identify potential mechanisms by which threat of unpredictable shock can facilitate distinct cognitive functions. A greater understanding of the complex interaction of the anxious state and cognitive processes may have critical clinical implications.","[Torrisi, Salvatore; O'Connell, Katherine; Davis, Andrew; Balderston, Nicholas; Ernst, Monique; Grillon, Christian] NIMH, Sect Neurobiol Fear & Anxiety, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Robinson, Oliver] UCL, Inst Cognit Neurosci, London, England","Torrisi, S (reprint author), NIMH, Sect Neurobiol Fear & Anxiety, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.","sam.torrisi@nih.gov","","Robinson, Oliver/0000-0002-3100-1132","Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Mental Health [MH002798, 02-M-0321]; Medical Research Council Career Development award [MR/K024280/1]","This study was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Mental Health; Grant Numbers MH002798 (Protocol 02-M-0321; NCT00047853) to C.G.

Questioning full independence, the two functions do, however, engage overlapping networks with activations in cingulo-opercular regions such as anterior insula (AI) and a reverse pattern of activation (stimulus-driven reorienting), and deactivation (executive control) in temporoparietal junction (TPJ). To test for independent versus shared neural mechanisms underlying stimulus-driven and executive control of attention, we used fMRI and a task that isolates individual from concurrent demands in both functions. Results revealed super-additive increases of left AI activity and behavioral response costs under concurrent demands, suggesting a common bottleneck for stimulus-driven reorienting and executive control of attention. These increases were mirrored by non-additive decreases of activity in the default mode network (DMN), including posterior TPJ, regions where activity increased with off-task processes. The deactivations in posterior TPJ were spatially separated from stimulus-driven reorienting related activation in anterior TPJ, a differentiation that replicated in task-free resting state. Furthermore, functional connectivity indicated inhibitory coupling between posterior TPJ and AI during concurrent attention demands. These results demonstrate a role of AI in stimulus-driven and executive control of attention that involves down-regulation of internally directed processes in DMN.","[Trautwein, Fynn-Mathis; Singer, Tania; Kanske, Philipp] Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Dept Social Neurosci, Stephanstr 1a, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany","Trautwein, FM (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Dept Social Neurosci, Stephanstr 1a, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.","trautwein@cbs.mpg.de","","Kanske, Philipp/0000-0003-2027-8782","European Research Council (ERC) under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme [205557]","European Research Council (ERC) under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (205557 to T.S.).","","87","7","7","0","12","OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1047-3211","1460-2199","","CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

Rate, an important feature in the execution of repeated movements, has been shown to vary following movement observation although the underlying neural mechanisms are unclear. In the current study, we examined how the rate of self-paced index finger pressing is implicitly modified following passive observation of a similar action performed at a different rate. MethodsFifty subjects performed a finger pressing sequence with their right hand at their own pace before and after passive observation of either a 1-min video depicting the task performed at 3Hz by someone else or a black screen. An additional set of 15 subjects performed the task in an MRI scanner. ResultsAcross all 50 subjects, the spontaneous execution rate prior to video observation had a bimodal distribution with modes around 2 and 4Hz. Following video observation, the slower subjects performed the task at an increased rate. In the 15 subjects who performed the task in the MRI scanner, we found positive correlation between fMRI signal in the left primary motor strip during passive video observation and subsequent behavioral changes in task performance rate. ConclusionWe conclude that observing someone else perform an action at a higher rate implicitly increases the spontaneous rate of execution, and that this implicit induction is mediated by activity in the contralateral primary motor cortex.","[Aridan, Nadav; Mukamel, Roy] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Psychol Sci, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Mukamel, Roy] Tel Aviv Univ, Sagol Sch Neurosci, Tel Aviv, Israel","Mukamel, R (reprint author), Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Psychol Sci, Tel Aviv, Israel.","rmukamel@tau.ac.il","","Mukamel, Roy/0000-0001-9359-8950","Israel Science Foundation [1771/13, 2043/13]; Human Frontiers Science Project Organization (HFSPO) [CDA00078/2011-C]; Israeli Centers for Research Excellence [51/11]","This study was supported by the Israel Science Foundation (Grant/Award Number: 1771/13 and 2043/13), the Human Frontiers Science Project Organization (HFSPO) (Grant/Award Number: CDA00078/2011-C), and the Israeli Centers for Research Excellence (Grant/Award Number: 51/11).","","46","7","7","0","12","JOHN WILEY & SONS INC","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA","2162-3279","","","BRAIN BEHAV","Brain Behav.","NOV","2016","6","11","","","","","","","","10.1002/brb3.550","","","","9","Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences","Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences & Neurology","EB7RJ","WOS:000387587500009","","DOAJ Gold, Green Published","","","2019-02-21","searchterm","searchterm_records_1001-1500.txt"

Temporal predictability can be either fixed (prior probability) or evolving (posterior probability), in which case it is dynamically updated as a function of the elapse of time itself (""hazard function""). We used fMRI to identify the brain regions involved in either form of temporal prediction, within a single experimental paradigm. Participants performed a cued reaction time (RT) task, in which the target appeared after one of four intervals (""foreperiods"") that was either predictable (temporal condition) or variable (neutral condition). As expected, RTs were faster in temporal versus neutral conditions, indicating the behavioural benefit of fixed temporal predictability. RTs also got faster as a function of foreperiod in the neutral, but not temporal, condition, reflecting the evolving temporal predictability of the hazard function. We confirmed that left inferior parietal cortex was preferentially activated by the fixed temporal predictability of temporal (versus neutral) cues. Then, by directly comparing how activity varied as a function of foreperiod in the neutral versus time conditions, we identified the neural substrates of the changes in temporal probability defined by the hazard function, while simultaneously controlling for changes related simply to the elapse of time itself. Whole-brain fMRI analyses (independently confirmed by anatomically guided ROI analyses) showed that activity in left inferior parietal cortex tracked the evolving temporal probabilities of the hazard function. ROI analysis further revealed a similar role for right inferior frontal cortex. Our data highlight a key role for left parietal cortex in instantiating the behavioural benefits of temporal predictability, whether predictions are fixed or dynamically evolving.

Whereas past research suggested that processing action language relies on sensorimotor brain regions, recent work suggests that sensorimotor activation depends on participants' task goals, such that focusing on abstract (vs. concrete) aspects of an action activates ""default mode network"" (rather than sensorimotor) regions. Following a Piagetian framework, we hypothesized that for actions acquired at an age wherein abstract/symbolic cognition is fully-developed, even when participants focus on the concrete aspects of an action, they should retrieve abstract-symbolic mental representations. In two studies, participants processed the concrete (i.e., ""how"") and abstract (i.e., ""why"") aspects of late-acquired and early-acquired actions. Consistent with previous research, focusing on the abstract (vs. concrete) aspects of an action resulted in greater activation in the ""defaultmode network"". Importantly, the activation in these regions was higher when processing later-acquired (vs. earlier acquired) actions-also when participants' goal was to focus on the concrete aspects of the action.

Tuning of voxels within each region is often assumed to be functionally homogeneous. To test this assumption, we recorded blood oxygenation level-dependent responses during passive viewing of complex natural movies. We then used a voxelwise modeling framework to estimate voxelwise category tuning profiles within each scene-selective region. In all three regions, cluster analysis of the voxelwise tuning profiles reveals two functional subdomains that differ primarily in their responses to animals, man-made objects, social communication, and movement. Thus, the conventional functional definitions of the PPA, RSC, and OPA appear to be too coarse. One attractive hypothesis is that this consistent functional subdivision of scene-selective regions is a reflection of an underlying anatomical organization into two separate processing streams, one selectively biased toward static stimuli and one biased toward dynamic stimuli.","[Cukur, Tolga] Bilkent Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey; [Cukur, Tolga] Bilkent Univ, Sabuncu Brain Res Ctr, Ulusal Manyet Rezonans Arastirma Merkezi, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey; [Cukur, Tolga] Bilkent Univ, Neurosci Program, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey; [Nishimoto, Shinji] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Frontier Biosci, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Huth, Alexander G.; Gallant, Jack L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Helen Wills Neurosci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gallant, Jack L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Program Bioengn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gallant, Jack L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Psychol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Cukur, T (reprint author), Bilkent Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.; Gallant, JL (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, 3210 Tolman Hall 1650, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.","cukur@ee.bilkent.edu.tr; gallant@berkeley.edu","","Nishimoto, Shinji/0000-0001-8015-340X","National Eye Institute [EY019684]; Center for Science of Information, an National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center [CCF-0939370]; European Molecular Biology Organization Installation Grant [IG 3028]; Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) [113C011]; Marie Curie Actions Career Integration Grant [PCIG13-GA-2013-618101]; TUBITAK 3501 Career Grant [114E546]; Turkish Academy of Science Young Scientists Award Programme (TUBA-GEBIP) fellowship","The work was supported in part by grants from the National Eye Institute (EY019684) and from the Center for Science of Information, an National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center, under Grant Agreement CCF-0939370.

The present study attempted to identify the neural substrates of responses to hostile and non-hostile jokes in gelotophobics and non-gelotophobics. Gelotophobics showed greater activation than did non-gelotophobics in the dorsal corticostriatal system, which comprises the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and dorsal striatum, suggesting a higher degree of voluntary top-down cognitive control of emotion. As expected, gelotophobics showed less activation in the ventral mesocorticolimbic system (MCL) in response to both hostile and non-hostile jokes, suggesting a relative deficit in the reward system. Conversely, non-gelotophobics displayed greater activation than gelotophobics did in the MCL system, particularly for non-hostile jokes, which suggests a more robust bottom-up emotional response. In response to non-hostile jokes, non-gelotophobics showed greater activation in the ventral MCL reward system, which comprises the midbrain, amygdalae, nucleus accumbens, ventral anterior cingulate cortex, and insula. Psychophysiological interaction analyses further showed that gelotophobics exhibited diminished MCL activation in response to hostile jokes.

However, research on reappraisal to date has examined almost exclusively its effect on the intensity of responses while failing to examine its effect on the duration of responses. To address this, we used inverse logit functions to estimate the height and duration of hemodynamic responses to negative pictures when individuals with recent life stress were instructed to use reappraisal either to decrease their negative emotion or to increase their positive emotion (relative to unregulated viewing of negative pictures). Several emotion-generative regions such as the amygdala, thalamus and midbrain exhibited decreases in duration of activation, even when controlling for differences in height of activation. In addition, whereas the amygdala exhibited both decreased activation height and duration when participants reappraised to decrease their negative emotion, it only exhibited decreased duration when participants reappraised to increase their positive emotion. These results indicate that emotion regulation alters the temporal dynamics of emotional responding and that models of reappraisal should accommodate whether reappraisal influences the height of activation, duration of activation or both, which may change based on the goal of the reappraisal strategy being used.","[Waugh, Christian E.; Sams, Katherine V.] Wake Forest Univ, POB 7778, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA; [Zarolia, Pareezad; Lumian, Daniel S.; Ciesielski, Bethany G.; Mcrae, Kateri] Univ Denver, Denver, CO 80208 USA; [Mauss, Iris B.; Ford, Brett Q.; Davis, Tchikima S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lumian, Daniel S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA","Waugh, CE (reprint author), Wake Forest Univ, POB 7778, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA.","waughce@wfu.edu","Waugh, Christian/F-8613-2015","Waugh, Christian/0000-0002-7871-5845","John Templeton Foundation","This research was supported by a grant to Iris B.

Recent neuroimaging studies in the context of smoking cessation, point to personal relevance as one of the key variables that determine the effectiveness of public health messages. While minority men who have sex with men (MSM) are at the highest risk of HIV infection, most safe-sex ads feature predominantly Caucasian actors in heterosexual scenarios. We compared brain respons of 45 African American MSM to safe sex ads that were matched (i.e. 'Targeted') to participants' sexual orientation and race, and 'Untargeted' ads that were un matched for these characteristics. Ad recall, perceived 'convincingness' and attitudes towards condom use were also assessed. We found that Targeted ads were better remembered than the Untargeted ads but perceived as equally convincing. Targeted ads engaged brain regions involved in self-referential processing and memory, including the amygdala, hippocampus, temporal and medial prefrontal cortices (MPFC) and the precuneus. Connectivity between MPFC and precuneus and middle temporal gyrus was stronger when viewing Targeted ads.

However, the neuroanatomical mechanisms underlying such impairments have not been systematically studied. Here we investigated the functional integrity of the amygdala connectivity network in relation to the ability to recognize emotions from facial expressions in VPT adults. Method Thirty-six VPT-born adults and 38 age-matched controls were scanned at rest in a 3-T MRI scanner. Resting-state functional connectivity (rs-fc) was assessed with SPM8. A seed-based analysis focusing on three amygdalar subregions (centro-medial/latero-basal/superficial) was performed. Participants' ability to recognize emotions was assessed using dynamic stimuli of human faces expressing six emotions at different intensities with the Emotion Recognition Task (ERT). Results VPT individuals compared to controls showed reduced rs-fc between the superficial subregion of the left amygdala, and the right posterior cingulate cortex (p = 0.017) and the left precuneus (p = 0.002). The VPT group further showed elevated rs-fc between the left superficial amygdala and the superior temporal sulcus (p = 0.008). Performance on the ERT showed that the VPT group was less able than controls to recognize anger at low levels of intensity. Anger scores were significantly associated with rs-fc between the superficial amygdala and the posterior cingulate cortex in controls but not in VPT individuals. Conclusions These findings suggest that alterations in rs-fc between the amygdala, parietal and temporal cortices could represent the mechanism linking VPT birth and deficits in emotion processing.","[Papini, C.; White, T.

Previous studies suggest that social cues modulate imitation but the mechanism of such modulation remains underspecified. Here we examine the locus, specificity, and neural basis of the social control of imitation. Social cues (group membership and eye gaze) were manipulated during an imitation task in which imitative and spatial compatibility could be measured independently. Participants were faster to perform compatible compared to incompatible movements in both spatial and imitative domains. However, only spatial compatibility was modulated by social cues: an interaction between group membership and eye gaze revealed more spatial compatibility for ingroup members with direct gaze and outgroup members with averted gaze. The fMRI data were consistent with this finding. Regions associated with the control of imitative responding (temporoparietal junction, inferior frontal gyrus) were more active during imitatively incompatible compared to imitatively compatible trials. However, this activity was not modulated by social cues. On the contrary, an interaction between group, gaze and spatial compatibility was found in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in a pattern consistent with reaction times. This region may be exerting control over the motor system to modulate response inhibition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated neural responses induced by sunk costs along with measures of core human personality. We found that individuals who tend to adhere to social rules and regulations (who are high in measured agreeableness and conscientiousness) are more susceptible to the sunk cost effect. Furthermore, this behavioral observation was strongly mediated by insula activity during sunk cost decision-making. Tight coupling between the insula and lateral prefrontal cortex was also observed during decision-making under sunk costs.

The neural mechanisms of real-world social behavior are of special interest during middle childhood (roughly ages 7-13), a time of increased social complexity and competence coinciding with structural and functional social brain development. Evidence from adult neuroscience studies suggests that social interaction may alter neural processing, but no neuroimaging studies in children have directly examined the effects of live social-interactive context on social cognition. In the current study of middle childhood, we compare the processing of two types of speech: speech that children believed was presented over a real-time audio-feed by a social partner and speech that they believed was recorded. Although in reality all speech was prerecorded, perceived live speech resulted in significantly greater neural activation in regions associated with social cognitive processing.

Twenty-six volunteers (12 women and 14 men; age 19-27 years) performed a sensory evaluation of taste of a solution of monosodium L-glutamate and sodium chloride, with and without glutathione.

A small number of studies have also shown that relatively short exposure to blue light leads to changes in functional brain responses during the period of exposure. The extent to which blue light continues to affect brain functioning during a cognitively challenging task after cessation of longer periods of exposure (i.e., roughly 30 minutes or longer), however, has not been fully investigated. Methods: A total of 35 healthy participants (18 female) were exposed to either blue (469 nm) (n = 17) or amber (578 nm) (n = 18) wavelength light for 30 minutes in a darkened room, followed immediately by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while undergoing a working memory task (N-back task). Results: Participants in the blue light condition were faster in their responses on the N-back task and showed increased activation in the dorsolateral (DLPFC) and ventrolateral (VLPFC) prefrontal cortex compared to those in the amber control light condition. Furthermore, greater activation within the VLPFC was correlated with faster N-back response times. Conclusions: This is the first study to suggest that a relatively brief, single exposure to blue light has a subsequent beneficial effect on working memory performance, even after cessation of exposure, and leads to temporarily persisting functional brain changes within prefrontal brain regions associated with executive functions. These findings may have broader implication for using blue-enriched light in a variety of work settings where alertness and quick decision-making are important.","[Alkozei, Anna; Smith, Ryan; Pisner, Derek A.; Vanuk, John R.; Berryhill, Sarah M.; Fridman, Andrew; Shane, Bradley R.; Knight, Sara A.; Killgore, William D.

The ventral striatum (VS) occupies a central role in shaping behavior by using feedback to evaluate actions and guide learning. The current studies tested whether feedback indicating the need to update social knowledge would engage the VS, thereby facilitating subsequent learning. We also examined the sensitivity of these striatal signals to the value associated with social group membership. Across two fMRI studies, participants answered questions testing their knowledge about the preferences of personally relevant social groups who were high (in-group) or low (out-group) in social value. Participants received feedback indicating whether their responses were correct or incorrect on a trial-by-trial basis. After scanning, participants were given a surprise memory test examining memory for the different types of feedback. VS activity in response to social feedback correlated with subsequent memory, specifying a role for the VS in encoding and updating social knowledge. This effect was more robust in response to in-group than out-group feedback, indicating that the VS tracks variations in social value. These results provide novel evidence of a neurobiological mechanism adaptively tuned to the motivational relevance of the surrounding social environment that focuses learning efforts on the most valuable social outcomes and triggers adjustments in behavior when necessary.","[Powers, Katherine E.; Kelley, William M.; Heatherton, Todd F.] Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Powers, Katherine E.; Somerville, Leah H.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Powers, KE (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, Northwest Sci Bldg Room 280-14,52 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.","kpowers@fas.harvard.edu","","","National Institute of Mental Health [R01MH059282]","This work was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health (R01MH059282).

Real-world social inference features much different parameters: People often encounter and learn about particular social targets (e.g., friends) over time and receive feedback about whether their inferences are correct or incorrect. Here, we examined this process and, more broadly, the intersection between social cognition and reinforcement learning. Perceivers were scanned using fMRI while repeatedly encountering three social targets who produced conflicting visual and verbal emotional cues. Perceivers guessed how targets felt and received feedback about whether they had guessed correctly. Visual cues reliably predicted one target's emotion, verbal cues predicted a second target's emotion, and neither reliably predicted the third target's emotion. Perceivers successfully used this information to update their judgments over time. Furthermore, trial-by-trial learning signalsestimated using two reinforcement learning modelstracked activity in ventral striatum and ventromedial pFC, structures associated with reinforcement learning, and regions associated with updating social impressions, including TPJ. These data suggest that learning about others' emotions, like other forms of feedback learning, relies on domain-general reinforcement mechanisms as well as domain-specific social information processing.","[Zaki, Jamil] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kallman, Seth; Ochsner, Kevin; Shohamy, Daphna] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Wimmer, G.

Such discrepancy may arise from the intention behind the threat: unintentionally introduced punishment threat facilitates, whereas intentionally introduced punishment threat hinders, norm compliance. Here, we combined a dictator game and fMRI to investigate how intention modulates the effect of punishment threat on norm compliance and the neural substrates of this modulation. We also investigated whether this modulation can be influenced by brain stimulation. Human participants divided an amount of money between themselves and a partner. The partner (intentionally) or a computer program (unintentionally) decided to retain or waive the right to punish the participant upon selfish distribution. Compared with the unintentional condition, participants allocated more when the partner intentionally waived the power of punishment, but less when the partner retained such power. The right lateral orbitofrontal cortex (rLOFC) showed higher activation when the partner waived compared with when the computer waived or when the partner retained the power. The functional connectivity between the rLOFC and the brain network associated with intention/mentalizing processing was predictive of the allocation difference induced by intention. Moreover, inhibition or activation of the rLOFC by brain stimulation decreased or increased, respectively, the participants' reliance on the partner's intention during monetary allocation. These findings demonstrate that the perceived intention of punishment threat plays a crucial role in norm compliance and that the LOFC is casually involved in the implementation of intention-based cooperative decisions.","[Zhang, Yuan; Yu, Hongbo; Yin, Yunlu; Zhou, Xiaolin] Peking Univ, Ctr Brain & Cognit Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yuan; Yu, Hongbo; Yin, Yunlu; Zhou, Xiaolin] Peking Univ, Dept Psychol, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yuan] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore Inst Neurotechnol SINAPSE, Ctr Life Sci, Singapore 117456, Singapore; [Zhou, Xiaolin] Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Machine Percept, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xiaolin] Peking Univ, Beijing Key Lab Behav & Mental Hlth, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xiaolin] Peking Univ, PKU IDG McGovern Inst Brain Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","Zhou, XL (reprint author), Peking Univ, Dept Psychol, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.","xz104@pku.edu.cn","","Zhang, Yuan/0000-0001-9157-5544; Yin, Yunlu/0000-0002-6433-3870","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) [2015CB856400]; Natural Science Foundation of China [91232708, 30110972]","This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program Grant 2015CB856400) and the Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 91232708 and 30110972).

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), this study sought to investigate how the loss and gain contexts modulated the neural responses to mutual cooperation. Twenty-five female participants were scanned when they played a series of one-shot prisoner's dilemma games in the loss and gain contexts. Specifically, participants and partners independently chose to either cooperate with each other or not, and each was awarded or deprived of (in the gain context or the loss context, respectively) a sum of money which depended upon the interaction of their choices. Behavioral results indicated that participants cooperated in nearly half of the experiment trials and reported higher level of positive emotions for mutual cooperation in both contexts, but they cooperated more in the gain than in the loss context. At the neural level, stronger activities in the orbitofrontal cortex were observed for mutual cooperation compared with the other three outcomes in both contexts, while stronger activation in ventral striatum associated with mutual cooperation was observed in the gain context only. Together, our data indicated that, even in the one-shot interaction under loss context, participants still exhibited preference for cooperation and the rewarding experience from a mutually cooperative social interaction activated the ventral striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex, but the loss context weakened the association between the ventral striatum activation and mutual cooperation.","[Sun, Peng; Li, Lin; Zhang, Weidong] East China Normal Univ, Sch Psychol & Cognit Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Li] East China Normal Univ, Key Lab Brain Funct Genom, Shanghai Key Lab Brain Funct Genom, Sch Psychol & Cognit Sci,Minist Educ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Guo, Xiuyan] East China Normal Univ, Shanghai Key Lab Magnet Resonance, Sch Psychol & Cognit Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Guo, Xiuyan] East China Normal Univ, Key Lab Brain Funct Genom, Shanghai Key Lab Brain Funct Genom, Minist Educ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Yijie] East China Normal Univ, Shanghai Key Lab Magnet Resonance, Dept Phys, Shanghai, Peoples R China","Zhang, WD (reprint author), East China Normal Univ, Sch Psychol & Cognit Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.; Guo, XY (reprint author), East China Normal Univ, Shanghai Key Lab Magnet Resonance, Sch Psychol & Cognit Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.; Guo, XY (reprint author), East China Normal Univ, Key Lab Brain Funct Genom, Shanghai Key Lab Brain Funct Genom, Minist Educ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.","wlkc_xyguo@126.com; wdzhang@psy.ecnu.edu.cn","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31271090, 71371180]; Key Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China [14AZD106]; Shanghai Leading talent Plan","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31271090; 71371180; http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/); the Key Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China (14AZD106; http://www.npopss-cn.gov.cn/); and the Shanghai Leading talent Plan (www.shrcw.gov.cn).

However, the vast majority of the sentence stimuli in previous reports have been of a social or social-emotional nature suggesting that sentence processing may be confounded with semantic content. To evaluate this possibility we had subjects read word lists that differed in phrase/constituent size (single words, 3-word phrases, 6-word sentences) and semantic content (social-emotional, social, and inanimate objects) while scanned in a 7 T environment. This allowed us to investigate if the aSTG/STS responded to increasing constituent structure (with increased activity as a function of constituent size) with or without regard to a specific domain of concepts, i.e., social and/or social-emotional content. Activity in the left aSTG/STS was found to increase with constituent size. This region was also modulated by content, however, such that social-emotional concepts were preferred over social and object stimuli. Reading also induced content type effects in domain-specific semantic regions. Those preferring social-emotional content included aSTG/STS, inferior frontal gyrus, posterior STS, lateral fusiform, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and amygdala, regions included in the ""social brain"", while those preferring object content included parahippocampal gyrus, retrosplenial cortex, and caudate, regions involved in object processing. These results suggest that semantic content affects higher-level linguistic processing and should be taken into account in future studies.

To test the framework's hypotheses, we compared subsequent memory effects (SME) of 10-12 year-old children, younger adults, and older adults using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Memory was probed by cued recall, and SME were defined as regional activation differences during encoding between subsequently correctly recalled versus omitted items. In MTL areas, children's SME did not differ in magnitude from those of younger and older adults. In contrast, children's SME in PFC were weaker than the corresponding SME in younger and older adults, in line with the hypothesis that PFC contributes less to successful encoding in childhood. Differences in SME between younger and older adults were negligible. The present results suggest that, among individuals with high memory functioning, the neural circuitry contributing to successful episodic encoding is reorganized from middle childhood to adulthood. Successful episodic encoding in later adulthood, however, is characterized by the ability to maintain the activation patterns that emerged in young adulthood. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Previous work has identified various threats to self-control in the eating domain, chief among which are desire strength and negative affect. In the present study, we examined individual differences in college-aged dieters' experiences of these threats as they encountered temptations to eat in their daily lives, and tested whether these differences characterized sub-groups of dieters with divergent self-control outcomes. Specifically, 75 dieting females (age range: 18-23) participated in a combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and experience sampling study. Participants passively viewed food cues during a fMRI session, and then reported their daily eating behaviors for one week via ecological momentary assessment. We examined the characteristics of dieters who exhibited the most favorable combination of the aforementioned factors (i.e., low desire strength and positive mood) and who were thus most successful at regulating their eating.

Therefore, variability in the brain's response to food may be partially explained by differences in levels of metabolically active tissues throughout the body, including fat-free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM). The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that children's body composition would be related to their brain response to food images varying in energy density (ED), a measure of energy content per weight of food. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to measure brain response to High (>1.5 kcal/g) and Low (<15 kcal/g) ED food images, and Control images, in 36 children ages 7-10 years. Body composition was measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Multi-subject random effects general linear model (GLM) and two-factor repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to test for main effects of ED (High ED vs. Low ED) in a priori defined brain regions of interest previously implicated in energy homeostasis and reward processing. Pearson's correlations were then calculated between activation in these regions for various contrasts (High ED-Low ED, High ED-Control, Low ED-Control) and child body composition (FFM index FM index, % body fat). Relative to Low ED foods, High ED foods elicited greater BOLD activation in the left thalamus. In the right substantia nigra, BOLD activation for the contrast of High ED-Low ED foods was positively associated with child FFM. There were no significant results for the High ED-Control or Low ED-Control contrasts. Our findings support literature on FFM as an appetitive driver, such that greater amounts of lean mass were associated with greater activation for High ED foods in an area of the brain associated with dopamine signaling and reward (substantia nigra). These results confirm our hypothesis that brain response to foods varying in energy content is related to measures of child body composition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

A breakthrough can be achieved by revealing the micro foundations of sociality, an additional component of the utility function reflecting the value of contributing to group success derived from social identity. Building upon our previous behavioral work, we conduct a series of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments (N=D 10 in the Pilot Study and N=D 15 in the Main Study) to measure whether and how sociality alters the functional activation of and connectivity between specific systems in the brain. The overarching hypothes is of this study is that sociality, even in a minimal form, serves as a natural mechanism of sustainable cooperation by fostering interaction between brain regions associated with social cognition and those related to value calculation. We use group-based manipulations to induce varying levels of sociality and compare behavior in two social dilemmas: Prisoner's Dilemma and variations of Ultimatum Game. We find that activation of the right in ferior frontal gyrus, a region previously associated with cognitive control and modulation of the valuation system, is correlated with activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to agreater degree when participants make economic decisions in a game with an acquaintance, high sociality condition, compared to a game with a random individual, low sociality condition. These initial results suggest a specific biological mechanism through which sociality facilitates cooperation, fairness and provision of public goods at the cost of individual gain. Future research should examine neural dynamics in the brain during the computation of utility in the context of strategic games that involve social interaction for a larger sample of subjects.","[Lukinova, Evgeniya] Skolkovo Inst Sci & Technol, Moscow, Russia; [Myagkov, Mikhail] Univ Oregon, Dept Polit Sci, Eugene, OR 97403 USA","Lukinova, E (reprint author), Skolkovo Inst Sci & Technol, Moscow, Russia.","jlukinova@gmail.com","","Lukinova, Evgeniya/0000-0002-8357-9307","Institute of Cognitive and Decision Sciences, University of Oregon; Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology","The first set of fMRI experiments (10 subjects) were funded through an award to MM from Institute of Cognitive and Decision Sciences, University of Oregon.

Alternatively, when observing the behavior of a maven (real estate expert), borrowers still consider the social aspect of the decision (although to a lesser extent), but ultimately follow the maven who presumably possesses a greater information set.

Such illusions have brought profound insights into the cognitive and neuronal mechanisms underlying temporary changes in body representation, but to put them in perspective, they need to be compared with ownership as experienced for one's real body. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare the neuronal correlates of touch under different degrees of body ownership. Participants' left and right arms were stimulated either alone or together with a fake counterpart while this stimulation was synchronous, ambiguous or asynchronous. Synchronous stimulation induced illusory fake arm ownership, but the brain still differentiated between touch to one's real arm and to an illusory 'owned' arm: the degree of arm ownership was encoded positively by activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and lateral occipitotemporal cortex and negatively in the temporoparietal cortex. Conversely, the ventral premotor cortex responded more strongly to synchronous stimulation compared with asynchronous stimulation and with real arm only stimulation. These results offer new insights into the differential representation of the real body vs a body that is temporarily self-attributed following the resolution of multisensory conflict.","[Limanowski, Jakub; Blankenburg, Felix] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Educ & Psychol, Neurocomputat & Neuroimaging Unit, Berlin, Germany; [Limanowski, Jakub; Blankenburg, Felix] Humboldt Univ, Berlin Sch Mind & Brain, Berlin, Germany","Limanowski, J (reprint author), Free Univ Berlin, FB Erziehungswissensch & Psychol, Habelschwerdter Allee 45,Raum JK 25-211, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.","jakub.limanowski@fu-berlin.de","","Limanowski, Jakub/0000-0001-9673-5500","","","","83","14","14","0","10","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

Prior neuroimaging studies have shown that why and how questions about actions differentially activate two cortical networks associated with mental-state reasoning and action representation, respectively; however, it remains unknown whether this is due to the differential demands of the questions per se or to the shifts in LOA those questions produce. We conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants judged pairs of action phrases that varied in LOA and that could be framed either as a why question (Why ride a bike? Get exercise.) or a how question (How to get exercise? Ride a bike.). Question framing (why vs how) had no effect on activity in regions of the two networks. Instead, these regions uniquely tracked parametric variation in LOA, both across and within trials. This suggests that the human capacity to understand actions at different LOA is based in the relative activity of two cortical networks.","[Spunt, Robert P.; Adolphs, Ralph] CALTECH, 1200 E Calif Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Kemmerer, David] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Spunt, RP (reprint author), CALTECH, 1200 E Calif Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.","spunt@caltech.edu","Spunt, Robert/O-9887-2014","Spunt, Robert/0000-0003-2975-4597","National Institutes of Health [R01 MH080721-03]","This work was supported in part by the National Institutes of Health (R01 MH080721-03 to R.A.).","","71","12","12","1","6","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

A total of 203 dance stimuli from a normed stimuli library were used in a series of independent experiments. The following measures were obtained: (i) subjective measures of 97 dance-naive participants' affective responses (Likert scale ratings, interviews); and (ii) objective measures of the physical parameters of the stimuli (motion energy, luminance), and of the movements represented in the stimuli (roundedness, impressiveness). Results showed that (i) participants' ratings of felt and perceived affect differed, (ii) felt and perceived valence but not arousal ratings correlated with physical parameters of the stimuli (motion energy and luminance), (iii) roundedness in posture shape was related to the experience of more positive emotion than edgy shapes (1 of 3 assessed rounded shapes showed a clear effect on positiveness ratings while a second reached trend level significance), (iv) more impressive movements resulted in more positive affective responses, (v) dance triggered affective experiences through the imagery and autobiographical memories it elicited in some people, and (vi) the physical parameters of the video stimuli correlated only weakly and negatively with the aesthetics ratings of beauty, liking and interest. The novelty of the present approach was twofold; (i) the assessment of multiple affect-inducing mechanisms, and (ii) the use of one single normed stimulus set. The results from this approach lend support to both previous and present findings.

Although this ability relies upon the concerted effort of multiple brain regions, the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) is most closely associated with the ability to reason about other people's mental states and form impressions of their character. Here, we investigated this region's putative social category preference using fMRI as 34 participants engaged in uninstructed viewing of a complex naturalistic stimulus. Using a data-driven ""reverse correlation"" approach, we characterize the DMPFC's stimulus response profile from ongoing neural responses to a dynamic movie stimulus. Results of this analysis demonstrate that the DMPFC's response profile is dominated by the presence of scenes involving social interactions between characters. Subsequent content analysis of video clips created from this response profile confirmed this finding. In contrast, regions of the inferotemporal and parietal cortex were selectively tuned to faces and actions, both features that often covary with social interaction but may be difficult to disentangle using standard event-related approaches. Together, these findings suggest that the DMPFC is finely tuned for processing social interaction above other categories and that this preference is maintained during unrestricted viewing of complex natural stimuli such as movies.","[Wagner, Dylan D.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Psychol, 1827 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Kelley, William M.; Haxby, James V.; Heatherton, Todd F.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA","Wagner, DD (reprint author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Psychol, 1827 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.","wagner.1174@osu.edu","Wagner, Dylan/B-1069-2015","Wagner, Dylan/0000-0002-1062-8163","National Institute on Drug Abuse-National Institutes of Health [R01DA22582]; National Institutes of Mental Health-National Institutes of Health [R01MH059282]","This work was supported by a grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse-National Institutes of Health (Grant R01DA22582) and the National Institutes of Mental Health-National Institutes of Health (Grant R01MH059282).","","49","10","10","1","9","SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474","","","J NEUROSCI","J.

We revealed multiple ER-nGPS signals that carried distinct information and contributed differentially to true and false memories: Whereas the ER-nGPS in the parietal regions reflected semantic similarity and was scaled with the recognition strengths of both true and false memories, ER-nGPS in the visual cortex contributed solely to true memory.

General linear model analysis also indicated activity in right frontal pole, as well as in additional cortical areas and subcortically in striatum, explained by humorousness.

Specifically, frontal pole has been shown to exhibit longer temporal receptive windows than, e.g., sensory areas, which might have enabled processing of humor in the clips based on holding information and reinterpreting that in light of new information several (even tens of) seconds later. As another novel finding, medial and lateral prefrontal areas, frontal pole, posterior-inferior temporal areas, posterior parietal areas, posterior cingulate, striatal structures and amygdala showed reduced activity upon re-viewing of the clips, suggesting involvement in processing of humor related to novelty of the comedic events.","[Jaaskelainen, Iiro P.; Lin, Fa-Hsuan] Aalto Univ, Sch Sci, Dept Neurosci & Biomed Engn, Brain & Mind Lab, Espoo, Finland; [Pajula, Juha] Tampere Univ Technol, Dept Signal Proc, FIN-33101 Tampere, Finland; [Tohka, Jussi] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Bioengn & Aerosp Engn, Leganes, Spain; [Tohka, Jussi] Inst Invest Sanitaria Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain; [Lee, Hsin-Ju; Kuo, Wen-Jui] Natl Yang Ming Univ, Inst Neurosci, Taipei 112, Taiwan; [Lin, Fa-Hsuan] Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Biomed Engn, Taipei 10764, Taiwan","Lin, FH (reprint author), Aalto Univ, Sch Sci, Dept Neurosci & Biomed Engn, Brain & Mind Lab, Espoo, Finland.; Kuo, WJ (reprint author), Natl Yang Ming Univ, Inst Neurosci, Taipei 112, Taiwan.; Lin, FH (reprint author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Biomed Engn, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.","wjkuo@ym.edu.tw; fhlin@ntu.edu.tw","Jaaskelainen, Iiro/C-7392-2012","Jaaskelainen, Iiro/0000-0001-6001-6950; TOHKA, JUSSI/0000-0002-1048-5860","Academy of Finland [138145, 276643, 130275, 263785]; Academy of Finland (FiDiPro); aivoAALTO project funding of the Aalto University; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 104-2314-B-002-238, MOST 103-2628-B-002-002-MY3, MOST 104-2410-H-010 -003 -MY2]; National Health Research Institute, Taiwan [NHRI-EX104-10247EI]; Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan [100-EC-17-A-19-S1-175]; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration [600371]; el Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [COFUND2013-40258]; Banco Santander","This study was supported by the Academy of Finland (project numbers 138145 and 276643 to IPJ, 130275 and 263785 to JT, FiDiPro to FHL), aivoAALTO project funding of the Aalto University, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (MOST 104-2314-B-002-238, MOST 103-2628-B-002-002-MY3, MOST 104-2410-H-010 -003 -MY2), National Health Research Institute, Taiwan (NHRI-EX104-10247EI), and Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan (100-EC-17-A-19-S1-175).

An influential literature in psychology has developed the theory that self-control relies on a limited common resource, so that fatigue effects might carry over from one task to the next. However, the biological nature of the putative limited resource and the existence of carry-over effects have been matters of considerable controversy. Here, we targeted the activity of the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) as a common substrate for cognitive control, and we prolonged the time scale of fatigue induction by an order of magnitude. Participants performed executive control tasks known to recruit the LPFC (working memory and task-switching) over more than 6 h (an approximate workday). Fatigue effects were probed regularly by measuring impulsivity in intertemporal choices, i.e., the propensity to favor immediate rewards, which has been found to increase under LPFC inhibition. Behavioral data showed that choice impulsivity increased in a group of participants who performed hard versions of executive tasks but not in control groups who performed easy versions or enjoyed some leisure time. Functional MRI data acquired at the start, middle, and end of the day confirmed that enhancement of choice impulsivity was related to a specific decrease in the activity of an LPFC region (in the left middle frontal gyrus) that was recruited by both executive and choice tasks. Our findings demonstrate a concept of focused neural fatigue that might be naturally induced in real-life situations and have important repercussions on economic decisions.","[Blain, Bastien; Pessiglione, Mathias] Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, Inst Cerveau & Moelle Epiniere, Ctr NeuroImagerie Rech, Motivat Brain & Behav Team, F-75013 Paris, France; [Blain, Bastien; Pessiglione, Mathias] Univ Paris 06, CNRS, INSERM, UMRS 1127,UMR 7225, F-75005 Paris, France; [Blain, Bastien; Hollard, Guillaume] Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, F-75013 Paris, France","Pessiglione, M (reprint author), Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, Inst Cerveau & Moelle Epiniere, Ctr NeuroImagerie Rech, Motivat Brain & Behav Team, F-75013 Paris, France.; Pessiglione, M (reprint author), Univ Paris 06, CNRS, INSERM, UMRS 1127,UMR 7225, F-75005 Paris, France.","mathias.pessiglione@gmail.com","Pessiglione, Mathias/E-2141-2017","","European Research Council (ERC-BioMotiv); Direction Generale de l'Armement; program ""Investissements d'avenir"" [ANR-10-IAIHU-06]","This study was funded by a starting grant for the European Research Council (ERC-BioMotiv).

Using fMRI, the MFC has been associated with diverse psychological processes, including motor function, cognitive control, affect, and social cognition. However, there have been few large-scale efforts to comprehensively map specific psychological functions to subregions of medial frontal anatomy. Here we applied a meta-analytic data-driven approach to nearly 10,000 fMRI studies to identify putatively separable regions of MFC and determine which psychological states preferentially recruit their activation. We identified regions at several spatial scales on the basis of meta-analytic coactivation, revealing three broad functional zones along a rostrocaudal axis composed of 2-4 smaller subregions each. Multivariate classification analyses aimed at identifying the psychological functions most strongly predictive of activity in each region revealed a tripartite division within MFC, with each zone displaying a relatively distinct functional signature. The posterior zone was associated preferentially with motor function, the middle zone with cognitive control, pain, and affect, and the anterior with reward, social processing, and episodic memory. Within each zone, the more fine-grained subregions showed distinct, but subtler, variations in psychological function. These results provide hypotheses about the functional organization of medial prefrontal cortex that can be tested explicitly in future studies.","[de la Vega, Alejandro; Banich, Marie T.; Wager, Tor D.] Univ Colorado, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Muenzinger D244,345 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [de la Vega, Alejandro; Banich, Marie T.; Wager, Tor D.] Univ Colorado, Inst Cognit Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Chang, Luke J.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Yarkoni, Tal] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Psychol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","de la Vega, A (reprint author), Univ Colorado, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Muenzinger D244,345 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.","delavega@colorado.edu","","Chang, Luke/0000-0002-6621-8120; Yarkoni, Tal/0000-0002-6558-5113; de la Vega, Alejandro/0000-0001-9062-3778; WAGER, TOR/0000-0002-1936-5574","National Institutes of Health [R01MH096906]","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant R01MH096906.","","77","50","50","1","20","SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474","","","J NEUROSCI","J.

Furthermore, the question of how observational learning occurs when observers must learn about the value of options from observing outcomes in the absence of choice has not been addressed. In the present study we used a multi-armed bandit task that encouraged human participants to employ both experiential and observational learning while they underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We found evidence for the presence of model-based learning signals during both observational and experiential learning in the intraparietal sulcus. However, unlike during experiential learning, model-free learning signals in the ventral striatum were not detectable during this form of observational learning. These results provide insight into the flexibility of the model-based learning system, implicating this system in learning during observation as well as from direct experience, and further suggest that the model-free reinforcement learning system may be less flexible with regard to its involvement in observational learning.","[Dunne, Simon; D'Souza, Arun; O'Doherty, John P.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Inst Neurosci, Dublin, Ireland; [Dunne, Simon; O'Doherty, John P.] CALTECH, Computat & Neural Syst Program, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [D'Souza, Arun] Univ Freiburg, Dept Psychol, Freiburg, Germany; [O'Doherty, John P.] CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Dunne, S (reprint author), CALTECH, MC 228-77,1200 East Calif Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.","sdunne@caltech.edu","","Dunne, Simon/0000-0003-4875-7953","Wellcome Trust; NIMH Caltech Conte Center for the Neurobiology of Social Decision Making","This work was supported by grants from the Wellcome Trust (to J.

Two kinds of developmental changes in face specialization were examined in this study: specialized maturation, or the continued tuning of a region to faces but little change in the tuning to other categories; and competitive interactions, or the continued tuning to faces accompanied by decreased tuning to nonfaces (i.e., pruning). MethodsUsing fMRI, in regions where adults showed a face preference, a face- and object-specialization index were computed for younger children (5-8 years), older children (9-12 years) and adults (18-45 years). The specialization index was scaled to each subject's maximum activation magnitude in each region to control for overall age differences in the activation level. ResultsAlthough no regions showed significant face specialization in the younger age group, regions strongly associated with social cognition (e.g., right posterior superior temporal sulcus, right inferior orbital cortex) showed specialized maturation, in which tuning to faces increased with age but there was no pruning of nonface responses. Conversely, regions that are associated with more basic perceptual processing or motor mirroring (right middle temporal cortex, right inferior occipital cortex, right inferior frontal opercular cortex) showed competitive interactions in which tuning to faces was accompanied by pruning of object responses with age. ConclusionsThe overall findings suggest that cortical maturation for face processing is regional-specific and involves both increased tuning to faces and diminished response to nonfaces. Regions that show competitive interactions likely support a more generalized function that is co-opted for face processing with development, whereas regions that show specialized maturation increase their tuning to faces, potentially in an activity-dependent, experience-driven manner.","[Zhu, Xun] Shihezi Univ, Dept Psychol, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Xun; Joseph, Jane E.] Med Univ S Carolina, Dept Neurosci, Clin Sci Bldg,Room 325E,MSC 616, Charleston, SC 29425 USA; [Bhatt, Ramesh S.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Psychol, Coll Arts & Sci, Lexington, KY 40506 USA","Joseph, JE (reprint author), Med Univ S Carolina, Dept Neurosci, Clin Sci Bldg,Room 325E,MSC 616, Charleston, SC 29425 USA.","josep@musc.edu","","","NIH/NICHD [R01HD052724, R01HD042452, R01HD075829]; NIH/NIMH [R21MH086958]","NIH/NICHD (R01HD052724); NIH/NIMH (R21MH086958); NIH/NICHD (R01HD042452); NIH/NICHD (R01HD075829).","","79","0","0","0","3","JOHN WILEY & SONS INC","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA","2162-3279","","","BRAIN BEHAV","Brain Behav.","JUN","2016","6","6","","","","","","","e00464","10.1002/brb3.464","","","","19","Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences","Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences & Neurology","DQ2FR","WOS:000379018200002","27313976","DOAJ Gold, Green Published","","","2019-02-21","searchterm","searchterm_records_1501-2000.txt"

We derive a common model space for the whole cortex using a new algorithm, searchlight hyperalignment, and complex, dynamic stimuli that provide a broad sampling of visual, auditory, and social percepts. The model aligns representations across brains in occipital, temporal, parietal, and prefrontal cortices, as shown by between-subject multivariate pattern classification and intersubject correlation of representational geometry, indicating that structural principles for shared neural representations apply across widely divergent domains of information. The model provides a rigorous account for individual variability of well-known coarse-scale topographies, such as retinotopy and category selectivity, and goes further to account for fine-scale patterns that are multiplexed with coarse-scale topographies and carry finer distinctions.","[Guntupalli, J.

Few studies have examined how changes in this network contribute to episodic memory development early in life. The present addressed this gap by examining relations between hippocampal functional connectivity and episodic memory in 4- and 6-year-old children (n = 40). Results revealed similar hippocampal functional connectivity between age groups, which included lateral temporal regions, precuneus, and multiple parietal and prefrontal regions, and functional specialization along the longitudinal axis. Despite these similarities, developmental differences were also observed. Specifically, 3 (of 4) regions within the hippocampal memory network were positively associated with episodic memory in 6-year-old children, but negatively associated with episodic memory in 4-year-old children. In contrast, all 3 regions outside the hippocampal memory network were negatively associated with episodic memory in older children, but positively associated with episodic memory in younger children. These interactions are interpreted within an interactive specialization framework and suggest the hippocampus becomes functionally integrated with cortical regions that are part of the hippocampal memory network in adults and functionally segregated from regions unrelated to memory in adults, both of which are associated with age-related improvements in episodic memory ability.

The impact of ANDR on stress responses in males and females has not been explored. Therefore, this fMRI study aimed to examine psychosocial stress reactions induced by mental arithmetic and social evaluation on behavioral and hormonal levels (46 participants: 15 naturally cycling females in their early follicular phase (EF), 15 females on hormonal contraceptives (HC) and 16 males); and on a neural level (40 participants: 13 EF-females, 13 HC-females and 14 males) in an ANDR and placebo treatment repeated-measures design. While no gender differences emerged in subjective ratings and performance during stress, neural activation patterns differed significantly. Besides, ANDR attenuated the post-stress increase of negative mood in all participants. Region of interest analyses showed that irrespective of treatment, males showed stronger activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) than females. At the whole brain level, gender differences emerged indicating stronger fronto-parietal activation in males compared to HC-females on both treatments. Males showed stronger visual and fusiform activation than EF-females under ANDR. Both female groups did not show stronger activation than males. Further, error ratio in the ANDR-stress condition was positively associated with their post-stress cortisol level and increase in subjective stress in males; and male DLPFC activity in the ANDR-stress condition was negatively associated with trait anxiety. Surprisingly, compared to HC-females, EF-female only showed stronger activation of arousal-related areas under placebo treatment. Taken together, these findings suggest that the male stress reaction under social evaluative threat was stronger than female stress reactions as a function of ANDR. More specifically, this effect on behavioral and neural stress reactions seems to depend on trait anxiety in males only.

The results revealed that participants reported lower pain intensity for the lucky guy. Neurally, reduced pain-related activations in anterior insula and anterior mid-cingulate cortex and increased activations in right superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and medial prefrontal gyrus (MPFC) were found for the lucky guy compared to the one with a plain partner. Right SFG and MPFC activations could predict participants' subsequent pain intensity ratings for the lucky guy.

A multinomial regression analysis revealed that the individual learning rate predicts students' membership to the independent MT, or the peer-and-teacher-dependent MT. Additionally, the striatum, a brain region associated with behavioral adaptation and flexibility, showed increased learning-related activation in students with motivational independence. Moreover, the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in behavioral control, was more active in students of the peer-and-teacher-dependent MT.

Prompted by a genome-wide association meta-analysis implicating the Ras-specific guanine nucleotide-releasing factor 2 (RASGRF2) gene in the regulation of alcohol intake in men, we have recently shown that male Rasgrf2(-/-) mice exhibit reduced ethanol intake and preference accompanied by a perturbed mesolimbic dopamine system. We therefore propose that these mice represent a valid model to further elucidate the precise genes and mechanisms regulating mesolimbic dopamine functioning. Methods Transcriptomic data from the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) of male Rasgrf2(-/-) mice and wild-type controls were analyzed by weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA). We performed follow-up genetic association tests in humans using a sample of male adolescents from the IMAGEN study characterized for binge drinking (n = 905) and ventral striatal activation during an fMRI reward task (n = 608). Results The WGCNA analyses using accumbal transcriptomic data revealed 37 distinct modules, or functionally related groups of genes. Two of these modules were significantly associated with Rasgrf2 knockout status: M5 (p < 0.001) and M6 (p < 0.001). In follow-up translational analyses we found that human orthologues for the M5 module were significantly (p < 0.01) enriched with genetic association signals for binge drinking in male adolescents. Furthermore, the most significant locus, originating from the EH-domain containing 4 (EHD4) gene (p < 0.001), was also significantly associated with altered ventral striatal activity in male adolescents performing an fMRI reward task (p(empirical) < 0.001). Limitations It was not possible to determine the extent to which the M5 module was dysregulated in Rasgrf2(-/-) mice by perturbed mesolimbic dopamine signalling or by the loss of Rasgrf2 function in the NAcc. Conclusion Taken together, our findings indicate that the accumbal M5 module, initially identified as being dysregulated in male Rasgrf2(-/-) mice, is also relevant for human alcohol-related phenotypes potentially through the modulation of reinforcement mechanisms in the NAcc. We therefore propose that the genes comprising this module represent important candidates for further elucidation within the context of alcohol-related phenotypes.","[Stacey, David] Univ Adelaide, Discipline Psychiat, Level 4,Eleanor Harrald Bldg,Frome Rd, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia;

Neuroimaging studies have revealed a distributed face network (FN) consisting of multiple regions that exhibit preferential responses to invariant or changeable facial information. However, our understanding about how these regions work collaboratively to facilitate facial information processing is limited. Here, we focused on changeable facial information processing, and investigated how the functional integration of the FN is related to the performance of facial expression recognition. To do so, we first defined the FN as voxels that responded more strongly to faces than objects, and then used a voxel-based global brain connectivity method based on resting-state fMRI to characterize the within-network connectivity (WNC) of each voxel in the FN. By relating the WNC and performance in the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test across participants, we found that individuals with stronger WNC in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (rpSTS) were better at recognizing facial expressions. Further, the resting-state functional connectivity (FC) between the rpSTS and right occipital face area (rOFA), early visual cortex (EVC), and bilateral STS were positively correlated with the ability of facial expression recognition, and the FCs of EVC-pSTS and OFA-pSTS contributed independently to facial expression recognition. In short, our study highlights the behavioral significance of intrinsic functional integration of the FN in facial expression processing, and provides evidence for the hub-like role of the rpSTS for facial expression recognition.

Furthermore, a recent fMRI investigation found differences in the neural correlates associated with ostracism in people with alcohol dependence compared to healthy controls. We predicted that acutely administered alcohol would reduce the negative effects of social ostracism. Alcohol (0.4 g/kg) or matched placebo was administered to a sample of 32 hazardous drinkers over two sessions in a randomized, double-blind, cross over design. In each session, participants were exposed to an ostracism event via the computerized ball passing game, ""Cyberball."" In order to quantify the effects of ostracism, the fundamental needs questionnaire was completed twice on each testing session; immediately after (i) social inclusion and (ii) social exclusion. Ostracism caused robust changes to scores on the fundamental needs questionnaire, in line with previous literature. Alcohol administration did not influence the effects of simulated social ostracism, which was supported by a Bayesian analysis. Exploratory analyses revealed a negative relationship between age and ostracism induced fundamental needs threat across both sessions. In conclusion, a moderate dose of alcohol did not influence experience of simulated social ostracism in hazardous drinkers. Further research is needed to establish the effects of alcohol administration on social ostracism using different doses and populations of alcohol users.","[Buckingham, Joseph] Queen Mary Univ London, Dept Biol & Expt Psychol, London, England; [Buckingham, Joseph; Moss, Abigail; Gyure, Krisztina; Hindocha, Chandni; Lawn, Will; Curran, H.

Here, we investigated the specific role of the insular cortex during retaliation, employing a controlled behavioral aggression paradigm implementing different levels of provocation. Fifteen healthy male volunteers underwent whole brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify brain regions involved in interaction with either a provoking or a non-provoking opponent. FMRI group analyses were complemented by examining the parametric modulations of brain activity related to the individual level of displayed aggression. These analyses identified a hemispheric lateralization as well as an anatomical segregation of insular cortex with specifically the left posterior part being involved in retaliation. The left-lateralization of insular activity during retaliation is in accordance with evidence from electro-physiological studies, suggesting left-lateralized frontocortical dominance during anger processing and aggressive acts. The posterior localization of insular activity, on the other hand, suggests a spatial segregation within insular cortex with particularly the posterior part being involved in the processing of emotions that trigger intense bodily sensations and immediate action tendencies.","[Emmerling, Franziska; Schuhmann, Teresa; Sack, Alexander Thomas] Maastricht Univ, Dept Cognit Neurosci, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Emmerling, Franziska; Schuhmann, Teresa; Sack, Alexander Thomas] Maastricht Brain Imaging Ctr, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Lobbestael, Jill; Arntz, Arnoud; Brugman, Suzanne] Maastricht Univ, Dept Clin Psychol Sci, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Arntz, Arnoud] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Clin Psychol, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands","Emmerling, F (reprint author), Maastricht Univ, Dept Cognit Neurosci, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.; Emmerling, F (reprint author), Maastricht Brain Imaging Ctr, Maastricht, Netherlands.","franziska.emmerling@maastrichtuniversity.nl","","","Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [HCMI 10-19]","This work was supported by a grant from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO; HCMI 10-19); http://www.nwo.nl/en/research-and-results/programmes/nihc/hcmi/index.html.","","34","9","9","0","12","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","SAN FRANCISCO","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","1932-6203","","","PLOS ONE","PLoS One","APR 20","2016","11","4","","","","","","","e0152000","10.1371/journal.pone.0152000","","","","14","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science & Technology - Other Topics","DJ9OU","WOS:000374543600007","27096431","DOAJ Gold, Green Published","","","2019-02-21","searchterm","searchterm_records_1501-2000.txt"

Enjoyment of feelings associated through social interaction motivates humans to build social connections according to their personal preferences. Therefore, we hypothesized that social interaction itself activates the reward system in a manner that depends upon individual interaction preferences. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in which 38 participants played a virtual ball-toss game in which the number of ball tosses to the participant was either similar to (normal-frequency condition) or higher than (high-frequency condition) the number of tosses to the other players. Participants reported greater-than-anticipated enjoyment during the high-frequency condition, suggesting that receiving a social reward led to unexpected positive feelings. Consistent with this, the high-frequency condition produced stronger activation in the ventral striatum, which is part of the reward system, and the precuneus, representing positive self-image, which might be translated to social reward. Furthermore, ventral striatal activation covaried with individual participants' preference for interactions with others. These findings suggest that an elevated frequency of social interaction is represented as a social reward, which might motivate individuals to promote social interaction in a manner that is modulated by personal preference.","[Kawamichi, Hiroaki] Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Grad Sch Human Hlth Sci, Tokyo 1168551, Japan; [Kawamichi, Hiroaki; Sugawara, Sho K.; Hamano, Yuki H.; Makita, Kai; Sadato, Norihiro] Natl Inst Nat Sci, Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Dept Cerebral Res, Div Cerebral Integrat, 38 Nishigonaka, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan; [Kawamichi, Hiroaki] Gunma Univ, Sch Med, Fac Med, Maebashi, Gumma 3718511, Japan; [Hamano, Yuki H.; Sadato, Norihiro] SOKENDAI Grad Univ Adv Studies, Dept Physiol Sci, Hayama 2400015, Japan; [Kochiyama, Takanori] ATR Brain Act Imaging Ctr, Kyoto 6190288, Japan","Kawamichi, H (reprint author), Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Grad Sch Human Hlth Sci, Tokyo 1168551, Japan.; Kawamichi, H (reprint author), Natl Inst Nat Sci, Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Dept Cerebral Res, Div Cerebral Integrat, 38 Nishigonaka, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan.; Kawamichi, H (reprint author), Gunma Univ, Sch Med, Fac Med, Maebashi, Gumma 3718511, Japan.","kawami@nips.ac.jp","","Kawamichi, Hiroaki/0000-0002-6172-8906; Kochiyama, Takanori/0000-0002-4023-0674","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [21220005, 15H01846, 25750407, 15K21602]","This study was partly supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (S) no. 21220005 (N.S.), Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) no. 15H01846 (N.S.), and by Grants-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) no. 25750407 (H.K.) and no. 15K21602 (S.K.S.) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.

The amygdala is also involved in processing animate and social information. However, it is unclear whether different categories of pictures (e.g., animals, objects) elicit different activity in the amygdale and other regions without conscious awareness. The objective of this study was to explore whether the factors of category, emotion and picture context modulate brain activation for unconscious processing. Pictures denoting different nonhuman animals and objects in negative and neutral emotional valences were presented using a sandwich-masking paradigm. Half of them were presented with human-related information in the contexts, and half were not. Our results showed significant interaction among category, emotion and context in the amygdala and subcortical regions. Specifically, negative animals elicited stronger activation in these regions than negative objects, especially with human contexts. In addition, there were different correlation patterns between the amygdala and cortical regions according to whether they included human context. There were limited activations in cortical category-related networks. These results suggest that the amygdala and subcortical regions dominantly process negative animals, and contextual information modulates their activities, making threatening stimuli that are most relevant to human survival preferentially processed without conscious awareness.","[Fang, Zhiyong; Li, Han; Yang, JiongJiong] Peking Univ, Dept Psychol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Fang, Zhiyong; Li, Han; Yang, JiongJiong] Peking Univ, Beijing Lab Behav & Mental Hlth, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Chen, Gang] NIMH, Sci & Stat Comp Core, NIH, US Dept HHS, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Yang, JJ (reprint author), Peking Univ, Dept Psychol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.; Yang, JJ (reprint author), Peking Univ, Beijing Lab Behav & Mental Hlth, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.","yangjj@pku.edu.cn","Fang, Zheyu/E-5724-2013","","Global Research Initiative Program, National Institutes of Health (NIH), USA [R01TW007897]; National Science Foundation of China [31571114]","This research was supported by grants from the Global Research Initiative Program, National Institutes of Health (NIH), USA (R01TW007897, JY), and the National Science Foundation of China (31571114, JY).","","62","4","5","5","23","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","PO BOX 110, EPFL INNOVATION PARK, BUILDING I, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND","1662-5161","","","FRONT HUM NEUROSCI","Front.

We investigated how the perception of facial expression emerges from the image properties that convey this important social signal, and how neural responses in face-selective brain regions might track these properties. To do this, we measured the perceptual similarity between expressions of basic emotions, and investigated how this is reflected in image measures and in the neural response of different face-selective regions. We show that the perceptual similarity of different facial expressions (fear, anger, disgust, sadness, happiness) can be predicted by both surface and feature shape information in the image. Using block design fMRI, we found that the perceptual similarity of expressions could also be predicted from the patterns of neural response in the face-selective posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS), but not in the fusiform face area (FFA). These results show that the perception of facial expression is dependent on the shape and surface properties of the image and on the activity of specific face-selective regions.

This information can be acquired either directly or indirectly, i.e., by observing emotional facial expressions (EFE) or indirectly by inferring emotions through cognitive perspective taking. Therefore, it is of great interest how the function of the cortical ToM network and the limbic system in affective ToM depends on the presence of facial expressions. We addressed this question in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. The experimental paradigm applied a well-established ToM cartoon task to test functional effects of EFE on the activation of the amygdala and the anterior ToM network during affective ToM judgments. During the task, 22 healthy participants had to judge the changes of the emotional state of the stories protagonist in the presence or absence of EFE. After quality control, 21 data sets entered the final analyses. The presence of EFE during affective ToM judgments was associated with shorter reaction times as well as increased activation of the right amygdala, most probably located in the basolateral nucleus (BLA), coincident with reduced activation of ToM-related regions of the prefrontal cortex. Psychophysiological interactions (PPI) revealed EFE-dependent modulation of connectivity between the right BLA and the contralateral ToM network regions. In combination with the functional interaction of EFE and affective ToM in the right amygdala, our data suggest a complementary but parallel organization of EFE processing and affective ToM. In this framework, the amygdala seems to act as an EFE detector when affective ToM judgments are demanded. Additionally, the facts that EFE induced exclusively right-sided amygdala activation and modulated the connectivity with the contralateral ToM network support the idea of a functional lateralization of stimulus driven components of affective ToM.

Neuroanatomically distinct networks have been associated with person perception and person knowledge, but it remains unknown how multiple features of a person (e.g. thin and kind) are linked to form a holistic identity representation. In this fMRI experiment, we investigated the hypothesis that when encountering another person specialised person perception circuits would be functionally coupled with circuits involved in person knowledge. In a factorial design, we paired bodies or names with trait-based or neutral statements, and independent localiser scans identified body-selective and mentalising networks. When observing a body paired with a trait-implying statement, functional connectivity analyses demonstrated that body-selective patches in bilateral fusiform gyri were functionally coupled with nodes of the mentalising network. We demonstrate that when forming a representation of a person circuits for representing another person's physical appearance are linked to circuits that are engaged when reasoning about trait-based character. These data support the view that a 'who' system for social cognition involves communication between perceptual and inferential mechanisms when forming a representation of another's identity.","[Greven, Inez M.; Downing, Paul E.; Ramsey, Richard] Bangor Univ, Sch Psychol, Wales Inst Cognit Neurosci, Bangor LL57 2AS, Gwynedd, Wales","Greven, IM (reprint author), Bangor Univ, Sch Psychol, Bangor LL57 2AS, Gwynedd, Wales.","i.greven@bangor.ac.uk","","Ramsey, Richard/0000-0002-0329-2112; Downing, Paul/0000-0002-5046-2858; Greven, Inez/0000-0003-2354-7677","Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K001884/1]","This work was funded by a grant from the Economic and Social Research Council (ES/K001884/1 to R.R.).","","59","8","8","2","9","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

Using a novel approach, we found that the anatomical connectivity of individual gray-matter voxels (determined via diffusion-weighted imaging) alone can predict functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses to 4 visual categories (faces, objects, scenes, and bodies) in individual subjects, thus accounting for both functional differentiation across the cortex and individual variation therein. Furthermore, this approach identified the particular anatomical links between voxels that most strongly predict, and therefore plausibly define, the neural networks underlying specific functions. These results provide the strongest evidence to date for a precise and fine-grained relationship between connectivity and function in the human brain, raise the possibility that early-developing connectivity patterns may determine later functional organization, and offer a method for predicting fine-grained functional organization in populations who cannot be functionally scanned.","[Osher, David E.; Saxe, Rebecca R.; Koldewyn, Kami; Gabrieli, John D.

More recent work has begun to examine the neural underpinnings of endogenous inhibition, revealing a distinct cortical basis in the dorsal fronto-median cortex [dFMC; Brass and Haggard (27:9141-9145, 2007); Kuhn et al. (30:2834-3843, 2009)]. Yet, contrary to everyday experiences of voluntary behavioral suppression, the paradigms employed to investigate action inhibition have thus far been somewhat artificial, and involve little persuasive motivation to act. Accordingly, the present fMRI study seeks to compare and contrast intentional with instructed inhibition in a novel pain paradigm that recruits 'hot' incentive response systems. Participants received increasing thermal stimulation to their inner wrists, and were required to occasionally withhold their natural impulse to withdraw from the compelling pain sensation at peak temperature, in both instructed and free-choice conditions. Consistent with previous research, we observed inhibition-related activity in the dFMC and the rIFC. However, these regions displayed equivalent activation levels for both inhibition types. These data extend previous research by demonstrating that under ecologically valid conditions with a strong motivation to act, both stopping networks operate in concert to enable suppression of unwanted behavior.","[Lynn, Margaret T.; Demanet, Jelle; Krebs, Ruth M.; Brass, Marcel] Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Psychol, Henri Dunantlaan 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Van Dessel, Pieter] Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Clin & Hlth Psychol, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Brass, Marcel] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Behav Sci, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands","Lynn, MT (reprint author), Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Psychol, Henri Dunantlaan 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.","maggie.lynn@ugent.be","Brass, Marcel/J-7082-2012","Brass, Marcel/0000-0002-3364-4019; Van Dessel, Pieter/0000-0002-3401-780X; Lynn, Maggie/0000-0003-2741-2067","European Science Foundation's EUROVETO project [09-ECRP-020]","We thank Pieter Vandemaele for technical support and Paul S.

However, one key aspect of modern food environments, food availability, especially of high energy foods, has not been adequately modeled in experimental research. Food that is immediately available for consumption could elicit stronger reward system activity and associated cognitive control than food that is not currently available for consumption and this could vary as a function of energy density. To examine this question, 32 healthy participants (16 women) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while passively viewing available foods - i.e. foods that could be eaten during and after the experiment - and unavailable foods of either high or low-caloric density in a 2 x 2 design. Available compared to unavailable foods elicited higher palatability ratings as well as stronger neural activation in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), amygdala, and left caudate nucleus as well as in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) - and thus structures implicated in reward and appetitive motivation as well as cognitive control, respectively. Availability effects in the caudate were mainly attributable to the high calorie condition (availability x calorie density interaction). These neuroimaging results support the contention that foods are particularly rewarding when immediately available and particularly so when high in caloric density. Thus, our results are consistent with health promoting interventions utilizing a nudging approach, i.e. aiming at decreasing accessibility of high calorie and increasing accessibility of low calorie foods in daily life. Results also imply that controlling/manipulating food availability may be an important methodological aspect in neuroscientific eating research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

One prevailing model suggests a functional division of labor in processing faces that different aspects of facial information are processed in anatomically separated and functionally encapsulated brain regions. Here, we demonstrate that facial identity and expression can be processed in the same region, yet with different neural coding strategies. To this end, we employed functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine two types of coding schemes, namely univariate activity and multivariate pattern, in the posterior superior temporal cortex (pSTS) - a face-selective region that is traditionally viewed as being specialized for processing facial expression. With the individual difference approach, we found that participants with higher overall face selectivity in the right pSTS were better at differentiating facial expressions measured outside of the scanner. In contrast, individuals whose spatial pattern for faces in the right pSTS was less similar to that for objects were more accurate in identifying previously presented faces. The double dissociation of behavioral relevance between overall neural activity and spatial neural pattern suggests that the functional-division-of-labor model on face processing is over-simplified, and that coding strategies shall be incorporated in a revised model.","[Yang, Zetian; Zhen, Zonglei; Huang, Lijie; Kong, Xiang-zhen; Wang, Xu; Song, Yiying] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Cognit Neurosci & Learning & IDG, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Yang, Zetian; Zhen, Zonglei; Huang, Lijie; Kong, Xiang-zhen; Wang, Xu; Song, Yiying] Beijing Normal Univ, McGovern Inst Brain Res, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Yang, Zetian] Rockefeller Univ, 1230 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Liu, Jia] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Psychol, Beijing Key Lab Appl Expt Psychol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China","Liu, J (reprint author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Psychol, Beijing Key Lab Appl Expt Psychol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.","liujia@bnu.edu.cn","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31230031, 31221003, 31471067, 31470055]; National Basic Research Program of China [2014CB846101]; National Social Science Foundation of China [13ZD073, 14ZDB160, 15ZDB139]; Changjiang Scholars Programme of China","This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31230031), the National Basic Research Program of China (2014CB846101), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31221003, 31471067 and 31470055), the National Social Science Foundation of China (13&ZD073,14ZDB160, and 15ZDB139), and Changjiang Scholars Programme of China.","","46","2","2","0","14","NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP","LONDON","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","2045-2322","","","SCI REP-UK","Sci Rep","MAR 21","2016","6","","","","","","","","23427","10.1038/srep23427","","","","10","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science & Technology - Other Topics","DH0ZP","WOS:000372514000001","26997104","DOAJ Gold, Green Published","","","2019-02-21","searchterm","searchterm_records_1501-2000.txt"

We conducted seed-based correlation analyses in cortical midline regions previously shown in meta-analyses to be involved in self-referential cognition: the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), central precuneus (CP), and caudal anterior cingulate cortex (CACC). We examined whether and how functional connectivity between these regions and the rest of the brain was associated with participants' degree of self-related information sharing. Analyses revealed associations between the MPFC and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), as well as the CP with the right DLPFC, the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex and left anterior temporal pole.

Here, we addressed this question using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess neural responses to emotional faces, combined with online ratings of subjective state. When instructed to rate their own affective response to others' faces, participants recruited anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate, inferior frontal gyrus, and amygdala, regions consistently implicated in studies investigating empathy for disgust and pain, as well as emotional saliency. Importantly, responses in anterior insula and amygdala were modulated by trial-by-trial variations in subjective affective responses to the emotional facial stimuli. Furthermore, overall task-elicited activations in these regions were negatively associated with psychopathic personality traits, which are characterized by low affective empathy. Our findings suggest that anterior insula and amygdala play important roles in the generation of affective internal states in response to others' emotional cues and that attenuated function in these regions may underlie reduced empathy in individuals with high levels of psychopathic traits.","[Seara-Cardoso, Ana; Viding, Essi] UCL, Div Psychol & Language Sci, 26 Bedford Way, London WC1H 0AP, England; [Seara-Cardoso, Ana] Univ Minho, CIPsi, Sch Psychol, Neuropsychophysiol Lab, Braga, Portugal; [Sebastian, Catherine L.] Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Psychol, London, England; [Viding, Essi; Roiser, Jonathan P.] UCL, Inst Cognit Neurosci, London, England","Seara-Cardoso, A (reprint author), UCL, Div Psychol & Language Sci, 26 Bedford Way, London WC1H 0AP, England.","ana.cardoso.09@ucl.ac.uk","","Seara-Cardoso, Ana/0000-0002-7618-9124; Sebastian, Catherine/0000-0001-8080-0582","Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia) [SFRH/BD/60279/2009]; Economic and Social Research Council [RES-062-23-2202, ES/K008951/1]; Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award; Wellcome Trust","This work was supported by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia) under grant number [SFRH/BD/60279/2009] awarded to A.S.C.; the Economic and Social Research Council under grant number [RES-062-23-2202] award to E.V; E.V. is a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award holder; C.L.S. was partially supported during the writing of this article by an Economic and Social Research Council award [ES/K008951/1]; J.P.R. is funded by the Wellcome Trust.","","61","12","13","3","28","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1747-0919","1747-0927","","SOC NEUROSCI-UK","Soc.

The term ""default mode"" was proposed to describe a baseline or default state of the brain during rest. Recent studies suggested that the default mode network (DMN) is comprised of two functionally distinct subsystems: a dorsal-medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) subsystem involved in self-oriented cognition (i.e., theory of mind) and a medial temporal lobe (MTL) subsystem engaged in memory and scene construction; both subsystems interact with the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC) and posterior cingulate (PCC) as the core regions of DMN. The present study explored the development of DMN core regions and these two subsystems in both hemispheres from 3- to 5-year-old children. The analysis of the intrinsic activity showed strong developmental changes in both subsystems, and significant changes were specifically found in MTL subsystem, but not in DMPFC subsystem, implying distinct developmental trajectories for DMN subsystems. We found stronger interactions between the DMPFC and MTL subsystems in 5-year-olds, particularly in the left subsystems that support the development of environmental adaptation and relatively complex mental activities. These results also indicate that there is stronger right hemispheric lateralization at age 3, which then changes as bilateral development gradually increases through to age 5, suggesting in turn the hemispheric dominance in DMN subsystems changing with age. The present results provide primary evidence for the development of DMN subsystems in early life, which might be closely related to the development of social cognition in childhood.","[Xiao, Yaqiong; Zhai, Hongchang] Guangzhou Univ, Coll Educ, Higher Educ Mega Ctr, 230 Waihuan West Rd, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Yaqiong; Friederici, Angela D.] Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Dept Neuropsychol, Leipzig, Germany; [Jia, Fucang] Chinese Acad Sci, Shenzhen Inst Adv Technol, 1068 Xueyuan Ave, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China","Zhai, HC (reprint author), Guangzhou Univ, Coll Educ, Higher Educ Mega Ctr, 230 Waihuan West Rd, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China.; Jia, FC (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shenzhen Inst Adv Technol, 1068 Xueyuan Ave, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.","zhaihongchang@126.com; fc.jia@siat.ac.cn","","","Research Project of Humanistic and Social Science of Ministry of Education in China [12YJA190023]; NSFC-Guangdong Union Foundation [U1201257]","We sincerely thank Dr. Jessica R.

Although research has focused on the neural substrates of self-esteem, little is known about the spontaneous brain activity that is associated with trait self-esteem (TSE) during the resting state. In this study, we used the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal of the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFFs) and resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) to identify TSE-related regions and networks. We found that a higher level of TSE was associated with higher ALFFs in the left ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and lower ALFFs in the left cuneus/lingual gyrus and right lingual gyrus. RSFC analyses revealed that the strengths of functional connectivity between the left vmPFC and bilateral hippocampus were positively correlated with TSE; however, the connections between the left vmPFC and right inferior frontal gyrus and posterior superior temporal sulcus were negatively associated with TSE. Furthermore, the strengths of functional connectivity between the left cuneus/lingual gyrus and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex were positively related to TSE.

The results show consistent responses of the anterior insula (AI) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), shared circuits of the aversive quality of affect, as well as the medial prefrontal cortex and temporal pole, central structures of the mentalizing network. However, the ACC/AI network activation was increased during vicarious embarrassment in response to a friend's failures. At the same time, the precuneus, a brain region associated with self-related thoughts, showed a specific activation and an increase in functional connectivity with the shared circuits in the frontal lobe while observing friends.

We examine individuals' neural response to anticipated and experienced monetary losses from earned and unearned monetary endowments using functional MRI. We show that the neural processing of monetary losses is modulated by the effort one has put into earning the money at stake. In particular, we find that the loss of earned monetary endowment leads to a decreasing activity in the brain's reward system. Our results suggest that the exertion of one's own effort to gain ownership increases the neurally measured value of ownership rights. Our results and method may prove useful in developing the first steps toward a biologically informed valuation of property rights.

In this study, we investigated the emotional effects and neural correlates of receiving empathic social responses after negative performance feedback and compared the effects of emotionally vs. cognitively empathic comments. 20 participants (10 male) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while receiving negative performance feedback for a cognitive task. Performance feedback was followed by verbal comments either expressing cognitive and emotional empathy or demonstrating a lack of empathy. Empathic comments in general led to less negative self-reported feelings and calmer breathing. At the neural level, empathic comments induced activity in regions associated with social cognition and emotion processing, specifically in right postcentral gyrus and left cerebellum (cognitively empathic comments), right precentral gyrus, the opercular part of left inferior frontal gyrus, and left middle temporal gyrus (emotionally empathic comments), as well as the orbital part of the left middle frontal gyrus and left superior parietal gyrus (emotionally empathic vs. unempathic comments). The study shows that cognitively and emotionally empathic comments appear to be processed in partially separable neural systems. Furthermore, confirming and expanding on another study on the same subject, the present results demonstrate that the social display of cognitive empathy exerts almost as positive effects on the recipient's feelings and emotions in states of distress as emotionally empathic response does.

In humans, androstadienone (ANDR), a synthetic male steroid, is a socially relevant chemosignal exhibited to increase positive mood and cortisol levels specifically in (periovulatory) females in positively arousing contexts. In a negative context, we expected that such effects of ANDR could amplify social evaluative threat depending on the stress sensitivity, which differs between menstrual cycle phases. Therefore, this fMRI study aimed to examine psychosocial stress reactions on behavioral, hormonal and neural levels in 31 naturally cycling females, between 15 early follicular (EF) and 16 mid-luteal (ML) females tested with ANDR and placebo treatment in a repeated measures design. Regardless of odor stimulation, psychosocial stress (i.e., mental arithmetic task with social evaluative threat) led to elevated negative mood and anxiety in all females. A negative association of social threat related amygdala activation and competence ratings appeared in ML-females, indicating enhanced threat processing by ANDR, particularly in ML-females who felt less competent early in the stress experience. Further, ML-females showed reduced performance and stronger stress related hippocampus activation compared to EF-females under ANDR. Hippocampal activation in ML-females also correlated positively with post-stress subjective stress. Contrarily, such patterns were not observed in EF-females or under placebo in either group. Strikingly, unlike passive emotional processing, ANDR in a stressful context decreased cortisol concentration in all females. This points to a more complex interaction of ovarian/gonadal hormones in social threat processing and stress reactivity. Our findings suggest that ANDR enhanced initial evaluation of self-related social threat in ML-females. Female stress reactions are related to stress sensitivity through enhanced awareness and processing of social cues in a stressful context, with menstrual cycle phase being a critical factor.","[Chung, Ka Chun; Peisen, Felix; Kogler, Lydia; Radke, Sina; Derntl, Birgit] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Fac Med, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Aachen, Germany; [Kogler, Lydia; Radke, Sina; Derntl, Birgit] Julich Aachen Res Alliance Translat Brain Med, Aachen, Germany; [Kogler, Lydia; Derntl, Birgit] Univ Tubingen, Fac Med, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Tubingen, Germany; [Turetsky, Bruce] Univ Penn, Dept Psychiat, Neuropsychiat Div, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Freiherr, Jessica] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Fac Med, Diagnost & Intervent Neuroradiol, Aachen, Germany; [Derntl, Birgit] Res Ctr Julich, Inst Neurosci & Med, INM 1, Julich, Germany","Chung, KC; Derntl, B (reprint author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Fac Med, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, Aachen, Germany.; Derntl, B (reprint author), Julich Aachen Res Alliance Translat Brain Med, Aachen, Germany.; Derntl, B (reprint author), Univ Tubingen, Fac Med, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Tubingen, Germany.; Derntl, B (reprint author), Res Ctr Julich, Inst Neurosci & Med, INM 1, Julich, Germany.","kchung@ukaachen.de; birgit.derntl@med.uni-tuebihgen.de","Freiherr, Jessica/N-9695-2015","Freiherr, Jessica/0000-0001-9052-4497; Radke, Sina/0000-0002-7844-2824","Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany (START) [691302]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [IRTG 1328]; Austrian Science Fund [FWF P23533]","The work in this manuscript was supported by the Medical Faculty, RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany (START 691302) and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, IRTG 1328).

Signals arising from the skin convey warmth, social touch, and the physical characteristics of external stimuli. Surprising or unexpected tactile sensations can herald events of motivational salience, including imminent threats (e.g., an insect bite) and hedonic rewards (e.g., a caressing touch). Awareness of such events is thought to depend upon the hierarchical integration of body-related mismatch responses by the anterior insula. To investigate this possibility, we measured brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging, while healthy participants performed a roving tactile oddball task. Mass-univariate analysis demonstrated robust activations in limbic, somatosensory, and prefrontal cortical areas previously implicated in tactile deviancy, body awareness, and cognitive control. Dynamic Causal Modelling revealed that unexpected stimuli increased the strength of forward connections along a caudal to rostral hierarchy-projecting from thalamic and somatosensory regions towards insula, cingulate and prefrontal cortices. Within this ascending flow of sensory information, the AIC was the only region to show increased backwards connectivity to the somatosensory cortex, augmenting a reciprocal exchange of neuronal signals. Further, participants who rated stimulus changes as easier to detect showed stronger modulation of descending PFC to AIC connections by deviance. These results suggest that the AIC coordinates hierarchical processing of tactile prediction error. They are interpreted in support of an embodied predictive coding model where AIC mediated body awareness is involved in anchoring a global neuronal workspace. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Pre-testing through focus groups or surveys is a standard, though inconsistent, predictor of effectiveness. Converging evidence demonstrates that activity within brain systems associated with self-related processing can predict individual behavior in response to health messages. Preliminary evidence also suggests that neural activity in small groups can forecast population-level campaign outcomes. Less is known about the psychological processes that link neural activity and population-level outcomes, or how these predictions are affected by message content. We exposed 50 smokers to antismoking messages and used their aggregated neural activity within a 'self-localizer' defined region of medial prefrontal cortex to predict the success of the same campaign messages at the population level (n = 400 000 emails). Results demonstrate that: (i) independently localized neural activity during health message exposure complements existing self-report data in predicting population-level campaign responses (model combined R-2 up to 0.65) and (ii) this relationship depends on message content-self-related neural processing predicts outcomes in response to strong negative arguments against smoking and not in response to compositionally similar neutral images. These data advance understanding of the psychological link between brain and large-scale behavior and may aid the construction of more effective media health campaigns.","[Falk, Emily B.; O'Donnell, Matthew Brook] Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, 3620 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Falk, Emily B.; Gonzalez, Richard; Dal Cin, Sonya] Univ Michigan, Res Ctr Grp Dynam, Inst Social Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48106 USA; [Tompson, Steven; Gonzalez, Richard] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Dal Cin, Sonya] Univ Michigan, Dept Commun Studies, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Strecher, Victor; An, Lawrence] Univ Michigan, Ctr Hlth Commun Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Cummings, Kenneth Michael] Med Univ S Carolina, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Charleston, SC 29425 USA; [An, Lawrence] Univ Michigan, Dept Internal Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Falk, EB (reprint author), Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, 3620 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.","falk@asc.upenn.edu","","","Michigan Center of Excellence in Cancer Communication Research [NIH-P50 CA101451]; NIH New Innovator Award [NIH 1DP2DA03515601]","This work was funded by The Michigan Center of Excellence in Cancer Communication Research/ NIH-P50 CA101451 (PI Strecher), and the NIH New Innovator Award: NIH 1DP2DA03515601 (PI Falk).","","49","25","25","0","15","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

However, little is known regarding how the vmPFC encodes subjective pleasantness induced by social reputation received from others. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how the vmPFC in males and females encodes the subjective pleasantness of social reputation received from the same gender and from the opposite gender. Behavioral data showed that positive reputation was perceived to be more pleasant than negative reputation. Intriguingly, both male and female subjects showed greater differences in the pleasantness scores between the positive reputation condition and the negative reputation condition from females than between positive and negative reputations from males. Imaging data revealed that the left vmPFC specifically contributed to the processing of positive reputation. The activity patterns of the vmPFC corresponded to the gender differences in behavior during the processing of social reputation. These results indicate that the vmPFC plays a role in representing the subjective value of positive social reputation and that this region might be a final computational site in a stream of value-based decision-making processes.

Here we investigate whether neural reactivity toward the suffering of other people is distinct from or overlapping with the neural response to pain and harm inflicted upon non-human entities, specifically animals and nature. We used fMRI to measure neural activity while participants (n=15) perceived and reported how badly they felt for the pain or harm of humans, animals, and nature, relative to neutral situations. Neural regions associated with perceiving the pain of other people (e.g. dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral anterior insula) were similarly recruited when perceiving and responding to painful scenes across people, animals, and nature. These results suggest that similar brain responses are relied upon when perceiving the harm of social and non-social biological entities, broadly construed, and that activity within the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral anterior insula in response to pain-relevant stimuli is not uniquely specific to humans.

The standard fROI method requires human experts to meticulously examine and identify subject-specific fROIs within activation clusters. This process is time-consuming and heavily dependent on experts' knowledge. Several algorithmic approaches have been proposed for identifying subject-specific fROIs; however, these approaches cannot easily incorporate prior knowledge of inter-subject variability. In the present study, we improved the multi-atlas labeling approach for defining subject-specific fROIs. In particular, we used a classifier-based atlas-encoding scheme and an atlas selection procedure to account for the large spatial variability across subjects. Using a functional atlas database for face recognition, we showed that with these two features, our approach efficiently circumvented inter-subject anatomical and functional variability and thus improved labeling accuracy. Moreover, in comparison with a single-atlas approach, our multi-atlas labeling approach showed better performance in identifying subject-specific fROIs.","[Huang, Lijie; Zhou, Guangfu; Liu, Zhaoguo; Dang, Xiaobin; Yang, Zetian; Kong, Xiang-Zhen; Wang, Xu; Song, Yiying; Zhen, Zonglei] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Cognit Neurosci & Learning, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Huang, Lijie; Zhou, Guangfu; Liu, Zhaoguo; Dang, Xiaobin; Yang, Zetian; Kong, Xiang-Zhen; Wang, Xu; Song, Yiying; Zhen, Zonglei] Beijing Normal Univ, IDG McGovern Inst Brain Res, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jia] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Psychol, Key Lab Appl Expt Psychol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China","Zhen, ZL (reprint author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Cognit Neurosci & Learning, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.; Zhen, ZL (reprint author), Beijing Normal Univ, IDG McGovern Inst Brain Res, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.; Liu, J (reprint author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Psychol, Key Lab Appl Expt Psychol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.","zhenzonglei@bnu.edu.cn; liujia@bnu.edu.cn","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31230031, 31221003, 31470055, 31471067]; National Basic Research Program of China [2014CB846101]; National Social Science Foundation of China [13ZD073, 14ZDB160]; Changjiang Scholars Programme of China","This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31230031), the National Basic Research Program of China (2014CB846101), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31221003, 31470055, and 31471067), the National Social Science Foundation of China (13&ZD073, 14ZDB160), and Changjiang Scholars Programme of China.

In Chinese, this requires a comprehensive consideration of phonological, orthographic and morphemic information. The left inferior frontal gyrus (L-IFG) has been implicated in this process in alphabetic languages. However, it is unclear whether the neural mechanisms underlying morphological processing in alphabetic languages would be the same in Chinese, a logographic language. To investigate the neural basis of morphological processing in Chinese compound words, an fMRI experiment was conducted using an explicit auditory morphological judgment task. Results showed the L-IFG to be a core area in Chinese morphological processing, consistent with research in alphabetic languages. Additionally, a broad network consisting of the L-MTG, the bilateral STG and the L-FG that taps phonological, orthographic, and semantic information was found to be involved. These results provide evidence that the L-IFG plays an important role in morphological processing even in languages that are typologically different.","[Zou, Lijuan] Zaozhuang Univ, Sch Psychol & Educ, Zaozhuang, Peoples R China; [Zou, Lijuan; Xia, Zhichao; Liu, Youyi; Shu, Hua] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Cognit Neurosci & Learning, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Zou, Lijuan; Xia, Zhichao; Liu, Youyi; Shu, Hua] Beijing Normal Univ, IDG McGovern Inst Brain Res, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Zou, Lijuan; Xia, Zhichao; Liu, Youyi; Shu, Hua] Beijing Normal Univ, Ctr Collaborat & Innovat Brain & Learning Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Packard, Jerome L.] Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst, Cognit Sci Grp, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Shu, H (reprint author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Cognit Neurosci & Learning, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.","shuhua@bnu.edu.cn","","","National Key Basic Research Program of China [2014CB846103]; Natural Science Foundation of China [31400864, 31271082, 81461130018]; Key Project of Philosophical and Social Science Foundation, ministry of education [11JZD041]; major program of National Social Science Fund of China [13ZD188, 11ZD186]; Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of Ministry of Education [14YJC190029]; Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning [CNLZD1201]; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [P01 HD001994]","This research was supported by National Key Basic Research Program of China (2014CB846103), by Natural Science Foundation of China (31400864, 31271082, 81461130018), by the Key Project of Philosophical and Social Science Foundation, ministry of education (11JZD041), by The major program of the National Social Science Fund of China (13&ZD188, 11&ZD186), by Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of the Ministry of Education (14YJC190029), by the Open Research Fund of the State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning (CNLZD1201), and by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (grant number P01 HD001994) to Haskins Laboratories.","","62","2","2","2","13","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","PO BOX 110, EPFL INNOVATION PARK, BUILDING I, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND","1662-5161","","","FRONT HUM NEUROSCI","Front.

In the current study we aimed to examine effects of frustration on brain activity while performing a well-learned task in participants with low and high tolerance for arousal. Prior to the functional magnetic resonance imaging session, the subjects underwent 2 weeks of Braille reading training. Frustration induction was obtained by using a novel highly difficult tactile task based on discrimination of Braille-like raised dots patterns and negative feedback. Effectiveness of this procedure has been confirmed in a pilot study using galvanic skin response and questionnaires. Brain activation pattern during tactile discrimination task before and after frustration were compared directly. Results revealed changes in brain activity in structures mostly reported in acute stress studies: striatum, cingulate cortex, insula, middle frontal gyrus and precuneus and in structures engaged in tactile Braille discrimination: SI and SII. Temperament type affected activation pattern. Subjects with low tolerance for arousal showed higher activation in the posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus, and inferior parietal lobule than high reactivity group. Even though performance in the discrimination trials following frustration was unaltered, we observed increased activity of primary and secondary somatosensory cortex processing the tactile information. We interpret this effect as an indicator of additional involvement required to counteract the effects of frustration.","[Bierzynska, Maria; Debowska, Weronika; Kossut, Malgorzata] Nencki Inst Expt Biol, Dept Mol & Cellular Neurobiol, Lab Neuroplast, Warsaw, Poland; [Bierzynska, Maria; Bielecki, Maksymilian; Duszyk, Anna; Zajkowski, Wojciech; Strelau, Jan; Kossut, Malgorzata] SWPS Univ Social Sci & Humanities, Dept Psychol, Warsaw, Poland; [Marchewka, Artur] Nencki Inst Expt Biol, Neurobiol Ctr, Lab Brain Imaging, Warsaw, Poland; [Falkiewicz, Marcel; Nowicka, Anna] Nencki Inst Expt Biol, Dept Neurophysiol, Lab Psychophysiol, Warsaw, Poland","Bierzynska, M; Kossut, M (reprint author), Nencki Inst Expt Biol, Dept Mol & Cellular Neurobiol, Lab Neuroplast, Warsaw, Poland.; Bierzynska, M; Kossut, M (reprint author), SWPS Univ Social Sci & Humanities, Dept Psychol, Warsaw, Poland.","m.bierzynska@nencki.gov.pl; m.kossut@nencki.gov.pl","Nowicka, Anna/R-9730-2016","Nowicka, Anna/0000-0002-5791-7237; Debowska, Weronika/0000-0002-1617-2363; Marchewka, Artur/0000-0002-1982-3299; Bielecki, Maksymilian/0000-0002-2881-4976; Kossut, Malgorzata/0000-0001-7808-1101","Ministry of Science and Education [3608/B/H03/2011/40]; European Regional Development Fund as part of the innovative Economy Operational Program, 2007-2013","Research supported grant no. 3608/B/H03/2011/40 to MK from Ministry of Science and Education.; The project was realized with the aid of CePT research infrastructure purchased with funds from the European Regional Development Fund as part of the innovative Economy Operational Program, 2007-2013.","","49","5","5","0","1","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","1664-1078","","","FRONT PSYCHOL","Front.

Thus, it is crucial to understand how empathy can be learned and how learning experiences shape empathy-related processes in the human brain. As a model of empathy deficits, we used the well-established suppression of empathy-related brain responses for the suffering of out-groups and tested whether and how out-group empathy is boosted by a learning intervention. During this intervention, participants received costly help equally often from an out-group member (experimental group) or an in-group member (control group). We show that receiving help from an out-group member elicits a classical learning signal (prediction error) in the anterior insular cortex. This signal in turn predicts a subsequent increase of empathy for a different out-group member (generalization). The enhancement of empathy-related insula responses by the neural prediction error signal was mediated by an establishment of positive emotions toward the out-group member. Finally, we show that surprisingly few positive learning experiences are sufficient to increase empathy. Our results specify the neural and psychological mechanisms through which learning interacts with empathy, and thus provide a neurobiological account for the plasticity of empathic reactions.","[Hein, Grit; Engelmann, Jan B.; Tobler, Philippe N.] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Lab Social & Neural Syst Res, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Engelmann, Jan B.] Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, Ctr Cognit Neuroimaging, NL-6525 Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Vollberg, Marius C.] UCL, Fac Brain Sci, Dept Expt Psychol, London WC1H 0AP, England","Hein, G (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Lab Social & Neural Syst Res, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.","grit.hein@econ.uzh.ch","Engelmann, Jan/H-8429-2014","Engelmann, Jan/0000-0001-6493-8792; Tobler, Philippe/0000-0002-4915-9448","Swiss National Science Foundation [PP00P1_128574, PP00P1_150739, CRSII3_141965]","We thank Jessica Gomes for help with data collection, Karl Treiber for scanning support, Chris Burke for valuable input on the data analyses, and Alexander Soutschek, Bjorn Lindstrom, and Tamara Herz for helpful comments on the manuscript.

Therefore, (1) explaining away the structured noise in multiple-output regression is of paramount importance. Additionally, (2) assumptions about the correlation structure of the regression weights are needed. We note that both can be formulated in a natural way in a latent variable model, in which both the interesting signal and the noise are mediated through the same latent factors. Under this assumption, the signal model then borrows strength from the noise model by encouraging similar effects on correlated targets. We introduce a hyperparameter for the latent signal-to-noise ratio which turns out to be important for modelling weak signals, and an ordered infinite dimensional shrinkage prior that resolves the rotational unidentifiability in reduced-rank regression models. Simulations and prediction experiments with metabolite, gene expression, FMRI measurement, and macroeconomic time series data show that our model equals or exceeds the state-of-the-art performance and, in particular, outperforms the standard approach of assuming independent noise and signal models.","[Gillberg, Jussi; Marttinen, Pekka; Kaski, Samuel] Aalto Univ, Helsinki Inst Informat Technol, Dept Comp Sci, POB 15600, Aalto 00076, Finland; [Pirinen, Matti; Ali, Mehreen] Univ Helsinki, Inst Mol Med Finland FIMM, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Kangas, Antti J.; Soininen, Pasi; Ala-Korpela, Mika] Univ Oulu, Fac Med, Computat Med, Oulu, Finland; [Kangas, Antti J.; Soininen, Pasi; Ala-Korpela, Mika] Bioctr Oulu, Oulu, Finland; [Havulinna, Aki S.] Natl Inst Hlth & Welf, Dept Hlth, Helsinki, Finland; [Jarvelin, Marjo-Riitta] Imperial Coll London, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, MRC PHE Ctr Environm & Hlth, Sch Publ Hlth, London, England; [Soininen, Pasi; Ala-Korpela, Mika] Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Pharm, NMR, Metabol Lab, Kuopio, Finland; [Jarvelin, Marjo-Riitta] Univ Oulu, Ctr Life Course Epidemiol, Fac Med, SF-90100 Oulu, Finland; [Jarvelin, Marjo-Riitta] Univ Oulu, Bioctr Oulu, SF-90100 Oulu, Finland; [Jarvelin, Marjo-Riitta] Oulu Univ Hosp, Unit Primary Care, Oulu, Finland; [Ala-Korpela, Mika] Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, Computat Med, Bristol, Avon, England; [Ala-Korpela, Mika] Univ Bristol, Integrat Epidemiol Unit, MRC, Bristol, Avon, England","Gillberg, J (reprint author), Aalto Univ, Helsinki Inst Informat Technol, Dept Comp Sci, POB 15600, Aalto 00076, Finland.","JUSSI.GILLBERG@AALTO.FI; PEKKA.MARTTINEN@AALTO.FI; MATTI.PIRINEN@HELSINKI.FI; ANTTI.KANGAS@ACOMPUTATIONALMEDICINE.FI; PASI.SOININEN@COMPUTATIONALMEDICINE.FI; MEHREEN.ALI@AHELSINKI.FI; AKI.HAVULINNA@THL.FI; M.JARVELIN@IMPERIAL.AC.UK; MIKA.ALA-KORPELA@COMPUTATIONALMEDICINE.FI; SAMUEL.KASKI@AALTO.FI","Marttinen, Pekka/N-6234-2015; Kaski, Samuel/B-6684-2008","Marttinen, Pekka/0000-0001-7078-7927; Kaski, Samuel/0000-0003-1925-9154; Pirinen, Matti/0000-0002-1664-1350; Jarvelin, Marjo-Riitta/0000-0002-2149-0630","Academy of Finland (the Finnish Centre of Excellence in Computational Inference Research COIN) [259272, 286607, 257654, 140057, 294238, 292334]; ""Machine Learning for Augmented Science and Knowledge Work"" project of Aalto University - Tekes the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation [Dnro 1718/31/2014]; Academy of Finland [104781, 120315, 129269, 1114194, 24300796]; University Hospital Oulu, Biocenter, University of Oulu, Finland [75617]; NHLBI through the STAMPEED program [5R01HL087679-02, 1RL1MH083268-01]; NIH/NIMH [5R01MH63706:02]; ENGAGE project; EU [HEALTH-F4-2007-201413, 277849]; Medical Research Council, UK [G0500539, G0600705, G1002319]; Sigrid Juselius Foundation; Strategic Research Funding from the University of Oulu; British Heart Foundation; Wellcome Trust","This work was financially supported by the Academy of Finland (the Finnish Centre of Excellence in Computational Inference Research COIN; grant numbers 259272 and 286607 to PM; grant number 257654 to MP; grants numbered 140057, 294238 and 292334 to SK).; This work was also supported by the ""Machine Learning for Augmented Science and Knowledge Work"" project of Aalto University funded by Tekes the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation (Dnro 1718/31/2014).; NFBC1966 received financial support from the Academy of Finland (project grants 104781, 120315, 129269, 1114194, 24300796, Center of Excellence in Complex Disease Genetics and SALVE), University Hospital Oulu, Biocenter, University of Oulu, Finland (75617), NHLBI grant 5R01HL087679-02 through the STAMPEED program (1RL1MH083268-01), NIH/NIMH (5R01MH63706:02), ENGAGE project and grant agreement HEALTH-F4-2007-201413, EU FP7 EurHEALTHAgeing -277849 and the Medical Research Council, UK (G0500539, G0600705, G1002319, PrevMetSyn/SALVE).; The development and applications of the quantitative serum NMR metabolomics platform are supported by the Academy of Finland, the Sigrid Juselius Foundation, Strategic Research Funding from the University of Oulu, the British Heart Foundation, the Wellcome Trust and the Medical Research Council, UK.","","51","2","2","0","2","MICROTOME PUBL","BROOKLINE","31 GIBBS ST, BROOKLINE, MA 02446 USA","1532-4435","","","J MACH LEARN RES","J.

The present study investigated amygdala habituation during a dot-probe task measuring attentional bias to backward masked fearful faces.

In the present fMRI study we investigated how these two different types of information conveyed by gaze direction interact with one another. Participants saw two faces that were either looking at each other or away from each other before jointly shifting gaze toward one of two target locations. Targets either appeared at the gazed at or the non-gazed at location. Behaviorally, gaze following (faster responses to congruent versus incongruent trials) was more prominent after observing eye contact than after observing no eye contact. In line with behavioral findings, neuroimaging results revealed enhanced activation in fronto-parietal and temporal areas in congruent trials when faces had looked at each other versus away from each other.

This ability improves with age, but the precise cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying its development remain elusive. The developmental changes could result either from younger children valuing immediate rewards more strongly or because older children become better at controlling their impulses. By implementing 2 tasks, a choice-independent valuation task and an intertemporal choice task, both behaviorally and using fMRI in twenty 6- to 13-year old children, we show developmental improvements in behavioral control to uniquely account for age-related changes in temporal discounting. We show further that overcoming temptation during childhood occurs as a function of an age-related increase in functional coupling between value signals in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and brain regions dedicated to behavioral control, such as left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during choice.

Yet, the properties of the external stimuli that elicit DMN activity in relation to these domains remain unknown. Previous studies suggested that motion kinematics is utilized by the brain for social-cognitive processing. Here, we used functional MRI to examine whether the DMN is sensitive to parametric manipulations of observed motion kinematics. Preferential responses within core DMN structures differentiating non-biological from biological kinematics were observed for the motion of a realistically looking, human-like avatar, but not for an abstract object devoid of human form. Differences in connectivity patterns during the observation of biological versus non-biological kinematics were additionally observed. Finally, the results additionally suggest that the DMN is coupled more strongly with key nodes in the action observation network, namely the STS and the SMA, when the observed motion depicts human rather than abstract form. These findings are the first to implicate the DMN in the perception of biological motion. They may reflect the type of information used by the DMN in social-cognitive processing.","[Dayan, Eran; Douek, Yehonatan; Flash, Tamar] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Comp Sci & Appl Math, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Dayan, Eran; Sella, Irit; Malach, Rafael] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Neurobiol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Mukovskiy, Albert; Giese, Martin A.] Hertie Inst Clin Brain Res, Dept Cognit Neurol, Tubingen, Germany; [Mukovskiy, Albert; Giese, Martin A.] Univ Clin Tubingen, Ctr Integrat Neurosci, Tubingen, Germany; [Dayan, Eran] NINDS, Human Cort Physiol Sect, NIH, Bldg 36,Rm 4D04, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Dayan, E; Flash, T (reprint author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Comp Sci & Appl Math, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.; Dayan, E (reprint author), Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Neurobiol, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.; Dayan, E (reprint author), NINDS, Human Cort Physiol Sect, NIH, Bldg 36,Rm 4D04, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.","dayane@ninds.nih.gov; tamar.flash@weizmann.ac.il","Dayan, Eran/C-3449-2009","Dayan, Eran/0000-0001-9710-9210","EU Commission [EC-ICT-257695 Vere, EC FP7-ICT-249858 TANGO, EC FP7-ICT-248311 AMARSi]; EU [PEOPLE-2011-ITN PITN-GA-011-290011, FP7-ICT-2013-FET-F/604102, FP7-ICT-2013-10/611909]; DFG [GI 305/4-1, KA 1258/15-1]; BMBF [FKZ: 01GQ1002A]","This work was supported by the EU Commission, 7th Framework Programme: EC-ICT-257695 Vere, EC FP7-ICT-249858 TANGO, and EC FP7-ICT-248311 AMARSi.

Both groups of adolescents reported similar increases in distress after being excluded in a virtual ball-tossing game (Cyberball), but adolescents with a history of chronic peer rejection showed higher activity in brain regions previously linked to the detection of, and the distress caused by, social exclusion. Specifically, compared with stably accepted adolescents, chronically rejected adolescents displayed: 1) higher activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) during social exclusion and 2) higher activity in the dACC and anterior prefrontal cortex when they were incidentally excluded in a social interaction in which they were overall included. These findings demonstrate that chronic childhood peer rejection is associated with heightened neural responses to social exclusion during adolescence, which has implications for understanding the processes through which peer rejection may lead to adverse effects on mental health over time.","[Will, Geert-Jan; Crone, Eveline A.; Guroglu, Berna] Leiden Univ, Inst Psychol, Wassenaarseweg 52, NL-2333 AK Leiden, Netherlands; [Will, Geert-Jan; Crone, Eveline A.; Guroglu, Berna] Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, LIBC, POB 9600, NL-2300 RC Leiden, Netherlands; [van Lier, Pol A.

In this study, we analyze how being endowed with different social statuses in a math competition affects the perception of fairness during asset allocation in a subsequent Ultimatum Game (UG). Behavioral data showed that when participants were in high status, they were more likely to reject unfair UG offers than in low status. This effect of social status correlated with activity in the right anterior insula (rAI) and with the functional connectivity between the rAI and a region in the anterior middle cingulate cortex, indicating that these two brain regions are crucial for integrating contextual factors and social norms during fairness perception. Additionally, there was an interaction between social status and UG offer fairness in the amygdala and thalamus, implicating the role of these regions in the modulation of social status on fairness perception.

We used repetition suppression, which is a rapid suppression of the neuroimaging signal upon repeated presentation of the same stimulus or core stimulus characteristics-in this case, the implied trait and person. Participants inferred familiar person's traits. At each trial, a critical (target) sentence described a behavior that implied a trait, and was preceded by a (prime) sentence that implied the same trait and portrayed the same person, the same trait but portrayed a different person or did not imply a trait and portrayed a different person. As predicted, we found partly overlapping repetition suppression areas in the ventral mPFC when persons and traits were repeated, indicating that not only traits but also familiar persons have a neural code in the ventral mPFC. We also found a negative correlation between activation when reading about a new person and participants' social network size, indicating that experience with larger social groups results in less recruitment of a person code.","[Heleven, Elien; Van Overwalle, Frank] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Psychol, Pleinlaan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium","Heleven, E (reprint author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Psychol, Pleinlaan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.","Frank.VanOverwalle@vub.ac.be","","","Vrije Universiteit Brussel [SRP15]","SRP15 project funded by the Vrije Universiteit Brussel.","","48","11","11","0","8","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

Congenital deafness in humans represents a particular case with respect to other types of sensory deprivation, because cortical reorganisation is not only a consequence of auditory deprivation, but also of language-driven mechanisms. Visual crossmodal plasticity has been found in secondary auditory cortices of deaf individuals, but it is still unclear if reorganisation also takes place in primary auditory areas, and how this relates to language modality and auditory deprivation. Here, we dissociated the effects of language modality and auditory deprivation on crossmodal plasticity in Heschl's gyrus as a whole, and in cytoarchitectonic region Te1.0 (likely to contain the core auditory cortex). Using fMRI, we measured the BOLD response to viewing sign language in congenitally or early deaf individuals with and without sign language knowledge, and in hearing controls. Results show that differences between hearing and deaf individuals are due to a reduction in activation caused by visual stimulation in the hearing group, which is more significant in Te1.0 than in Heschl's gyrus as a whole. Furthermore, differences between deaf and hearing groups are due to auditory deprivation, and there is no evidence that the modality of language used by deaf individuals contributes to crossmodal plasticity in Heschl's gyrus.

However, the existing literature mainly dealt with effects of motor and visual expertise, whereas the neural and cognitive mechanisms that underlie the interpretation of dance choreographies remained unexplored. Hence, much attention has been given to the action observation network (AON) whereas the role of other potentially relevant neuro-cognitive mechanisms such as mentalizing (theory of mind) or language (narrative comprehension) in dance understanding is yet to be elucidated. We report the results of an fMRI study where the structural coherence of short contemporary dance choreographies was manipulated parametrically using the same taped movement material. Our participants were all trained dancers. The whole-brain analysis argues that the interpretation of structurally coherent dance phrases involves a subpart (superior parietal) of the AON as well as mentalizing regions in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. An ROI analysis based on a similar study using linguisticmaterials (Pallier et al., 2011) suggests that structural processing in language and dance might share certain neural mechanisms.

In this article, I will analyse the evidence used by Greene to suggest a different kind of argument against deontology, which I will call the argument from self-defeating beliefs. The charge of this type of argument amounts to exposing a psychological nature of deontological judgements that is supposedly rejected by deontologists.

Because of the near exclusive usage in past research of visual stimuli to elicit emotions, it is unknown whether the same neural substrates underlie the reappraisal of emotions induced through other sensory modalities. Here, participants reappraised their emotions in order to increase or decrease their emotional response to angry prosody, or maintained their attention to it in a control condition. Neural activity was monitored with fMRI, and connectivity was investigated by using psychophysiological interaction analyses. A right-sided network encompassing the superior temporal gyrus, the superior temporal sulcus and the inferior frontal gyrus was found to underlie the processing of angry prosody. During reappraisal to increase emotional response, the left superior frontal gyrus showed increased activity and became functionally coupled to right auditory cortices. During reappraisal to decrease emotional response, a network that included the medial frontal gyrus and posterior parietal areas showed increased activation and greater functional connectivity with bilateral auditory regions. Activations pertaining to this network were more extended on the right side of the brain. Although directionality cannot be inferred from PPI analyses, the findings suggest a similar frontoparietal network for the reappraisal of visually and auditorily induced negative emotions.","[Korb, Sebastian] Int Sch Adv Studies SISSA, I-34136 Trieste, Italy; [Fruehholz, Sascha; Grandjean, Didier] Swiss Ctr Affect Sci, Geneva, Switzerland; [Fruehholz, Sascha; Grandjean, Didier] Univ Geneva, Dept Psychol & Educ Sci, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland","Korb, S (reprint author), Int Sch Adv Studies SISSA, Neurosci Area, Via Bonomea 265, I-34136 Trieste, Italy.","skorb@sissa.it","Korb, Sebastian/A-6294-2016","Korb, Sebastian/0000-0002-3517-3783; Grandjean, Didier/0000-0001-6125-4520","Swiss National Science Foundation [51NF40-104897, PBGEP1-139870, SNSF 105314_146559/1]","The work was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (Funds 51NF40-104897 to D.G., PBGEP1-139870 to S.K., and SNSF 105314_146559/1 to S.F.).","","82","3","3","0","13","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

Here, we investigated emotions induced by music using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a data-driven approach based on intersubject correlations (ISC). This method allowed us to identify moments in the music that produced similar brain activity (i.e. synchrony) among listeners under relatively natural listening conditions. Continuous ratings of subjective pleasantness and arousal elicited by the music were also obtained for the music outside of the scanner. Our results reveal synchronous activations in left amygdala, left insula and right caudate nucleus that were associated with higher arousal, whereas positive valence ratings correlated with decreases in amygdala and caudate activity. Additional analyses showed that synchronous amygdala responses were driven by energy-related features in the music such as root mean square and dissonance, while synchrony in insula was additionally sensitive to acoustic event density. Intersubject synchrony also occurred in the left nucleus accumbens, a region critically implicated in reward processing. Our study demonstrates the feasibility and usefulness of an approach based on ISC to explore the temporal dynamics of music perception and emotion in naturalistic conditions.","[Trost, Wiebke; Fruehholz, Sascha; Cojan, Yann; Vuilleumier, Patrik] Univ Geneva, Swiss Ctr Affect Sci, CH-1202 Geneva, Switzerland; [Trost, Wiebke; Fruehholz, Sascha] Univ Geneva, Neurosci Emot & Affect Dynam Lab, CH-1202 Geneva, Switzerland; [Cochrane, Tom] Univ Sheffield, Dept Philosophy, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Cojan, Yann; Vuilleumier, Patrik] Univ Geneva, Lab Behav Neurol & Imaging Cognit, CH-1202 Geneva, Switzerland","Trost, W (reprint author), Univ Geneva, Swiss Ctr Affect Sci, Biotech Campus,9,Chemin Mines, CH-1202 Geneva, Switzerland.","Johanna.trost@unige.ch","","Cochrane, Tom/0000-0001-6246-161X","Lemanic Neuroscience Doctoral School; Geneva Academic Society (Foremane Fund); Swiss National Center for Affective Sciences (NCCR SNF) [51NF40-104897]","This work was supported by a PhD fellowship awarded to W.T. by the Lemanic Neuroscience Doctoral School, an award from the Geneva Academic Society (Foremane Fund) to P.V., and the Swiss National Center for Affective Sciences (NCCR SNF No. 51NF40-104897).","","80","21","21","0","16","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

The present fMRI study aimed to determine which neural structures selectively increase the incentive value of need-relevant stimuli in a thirst state. Towards this end, participants were scanned twice-either in a thirst or no-thirst state-while viewing pictures of beverages and chairs. As expected, thirst led to a selective increase in self-reported pleasantness and arousal by beverages. Increased responses to beverage when compared with chair stimuli were observed in the cingulate cortex, insular cortex and the amygdala in the thirst state, which were absent in the no-thirst condition. Enhancing the incentive value of need-relevant cues in a thirst state is a key mechanism for motivating drinking behavior.

This study aimed to pilot test a developmentally-appropriate guided cognitive reappraisal task in order to examine the effects of cognitive reappraisal on children's self-reports of affect and brain responses. Study 1 (N = 19, 4-10 years-old) found that children successfully employed guided cognitive reappraisal to decrease subjective ratings of negative affect, supporting the effectiveness of the guided cognitive reappraisal task. Study 2 (N = 15, ages 6-10 years-old) investigated the neural responses to guided cognitive reappraisal and found that the neural responses showed increased activation in the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex during the cognitive reappraisal condition compared to the no regulation condition. In addition, amygdala activity was positively correlated with ventromedial prefrontal cortex activation during cognitive reappraisal. Findings suggest that the neural networks supporting cognitive reappraisal in children involve similar brain regions but brain responses deviate from findings in adults. Our findings suggest that the neural networks supporting emotion regulation are still developing during middle childhood, and future research is necessary to delineate age-related development of the neural network involved in cognitive reappraisal.","[Dougherty, Lea R.; Blankenship, Sarah L.; Spechler, Philip A.; Padmala, Srikanth; Pessoa, Luiz] Univ Maryland, Dept Psychol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","Dougherty, LR (reprint author), Univ Maryland, Dept Psychol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.","ldougher@umd.edu","","Spechler, Philip/0000-0003-3833-7672","University of Maryland (UMD) Maryland Neuroimaging Center Seed Grant Program; UMD College of Behavioral and Social Sciences Dean's Research Initiative Award; UMD Research and Scholars Award; National Institute of Mental Health [R01 MH071589]","This research was supported by the University of Maryland (UMD) Maryland Neuroimaging Center Seed Grant Program (LRD, LP), UMD College of Behavioral and Social Sciences Dean's Research Initiative Award (LRD), the UMD Research and Scholars Award (LRD) and in part by the National Institute of Mental Health R01 MH071589 (LP).

As these two functions have mostly been investigated in isolation, the specificity of the underlying neural networks and the relation of these networks to the respective behavioral indices could not be tested. Here, we present a novel fMRI paradigm (EmpaToM) that independently manipulates both empathy and ToM. Experiments 1a/b (N = 90) validated the task with established empathy and ToM paradigms on a behavioral and neural level. Experiment 2 (N = 178) employed the EmpaToM and revealed clearly separable neural networks including anterior insula for empathy and ventral temporoparietal junction for ToM. These distinct networks could be replicated in task-free resting state functional connectivity. Importantly, brain activity in these two networks specifically predicted the respective behavioral indices, that is, inter-individual differences in ToM related brain activity predicted inter-individual differences in ToM performance, but not empathic responding, and vice versa. Taken together, the validated EmpaToM allows separation of affective and cognitive routes to understanding others. It may thus benefit future clinical, developmental, and intervention studies on identifying selective impairments and improvement in specific components of social cognition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we resolve this discrepancy in the literature by showing that different parts of the medial prefrontal cortex are active depending on whether an observed unusual behaviour is intentional or not. While the posterior medial prefrontal cortex is more active when we observe unusual accidental actions compared to unusual intentional actions, a more anterior part of the medial prefrontal cortex is more active when we observe unusual intentional actions compared to unusual accidental actions.

Thus, it is not surprising that we are highly skilled at recognizing the emotions of others. Here we aimed to examine the neuronal correlates of emotion recognition from gait. To this end we created highly controlled dynamic body-movement stimuli based on real human motion-capture data (Roether et al., 2009). These animated avatars displayed gait in four emotional (happy, angry, fearful, and sad) and speed-matched neutral styles. For each emotional gait and its equivalent neutral gait, avatars were displayed at five morphing levels between the two. Subjects underwent fMRI scanning while classifying the emotions and the emotional intensity levels expressed by the avatars. Our results revealed robust brain selectivity to emotional compared to neutral gait stimuli in brain regions which are involved in emotion and biological motion processing, such as the extrastriate body area (EBA), fusiform body area (FBA), superior temporal sulcus (STS), and the amygdala (AMG). Brain activity in the amygdala reflected emotional awareness: for visually identical stimuli it showed amplified stronger response when the stimulus was perceived as emotional. Notably, in avatars gradually morphed along an emotional expression axis there was a parametric correlation between amygdala activity and emotional intensity. This study extends the mapping of emotional decoding in the human brain to the domain of highly controlled dynamic biological motion. Our results highlight an extensive level of brain processing of emotional information related to body language, which relies mostly on body kinematics.

However, insufficient attention has been given to cerebellar contributions to most other social cognitive functions, including ones that rely upon the use of biological motion cues for making mental inferences. Here, using adapted Heider and Simmel stimuli in a passive-viewing paradigm, we present functional magnetic resonance imaging evidence detailing cerebellar contributions to animacy attribution processes in healthy adults. We found robust cerebellar activity associated with viewing animate versus random movement in hemispheric lobule VII bilaterally as well as in vermal and paravermal lobule IX. Stronger activity in left Crus I and lobule VI was associated with a greater tendency to describe the stimuli in social-affective versus motionrelated terms. Psychophysiological interaction analysis indicated preferential effective connectivity between right pSTS and left Crus II during the viewing of animate than random stimuli, controlling for individual variance in social attributions. These findings indicate that lobules VI, VII, and IX participate in social functions even when no active response is required. This cerebellar activity may also partially explain individual differences in animacy attribution.","[Jack, Allison; Pelphrey, Kevin A.] Yale Univ, Ctr Child Study, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Jack, A (reprint author), Yale Child Study Ctr, 230 South Frontage Rd, New Haven, CT 06519 USA.","allison.jack@yale.edu","","Jack, Allison/0000-0002-7792-6464","National Institute of Mental Health at the National Institutes of Health [5-T32-MH018268]; Yale University School of Medicine Harris Professorship funds; National Center for Research Resources at the National Institutes of Health [S10-RR019895, S10-RR029676-01]","This work was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health at the National Institutes of Health (5-T32-MH018268 to trainee A.J.) and Yale University School of Medicine Harris Professorship funds to K.A.P.

Participants performed a visual lexical decision task in English in which the letters in words and letterstrings were delivered either sequentially (promoting phonological assembly) or simultaneously (not promoting phonological assembly). A region of interest analysis confirmed that regions previously associated with phonological assembly, in studies contrasting different word types (e.g. words versus pseudowords), were also identified using our novel task that controls for a number of confounding variables. Specifically, the left pars opercularis, the superior part of the ventral precentral gyrus and the supramarginal gyrus were all recruited more during sequential delivery than simultaneous delivery, even when various psycholinguistic characteristics of the stimuli were controlled.

Humans are remarkably capable of navigating and keeping track of all the parallel social activities of everyday life even when confronted with interruptions or changes in the environment. However, the underlying cognitive and neurocognitive mechanisms of such long-term integration and profiling of information remain a challenge to neuroscience. While brain activity is generally traceable within the short time frame of working memory (milliseconds to seconds), these integrative processes last for minutes, hours or even days. Here we report two experiments on story comprehension. Experiment I establishes a cognitive dissociation between our comprehension of plot and incidental facts in narratives: when episodic material allows for long-term integration in a coherent plot, we recall fewer factual details. However, when plot formation is challenged, we pay more attention to incidental facts. Experiment II investigates the neural underpinnings of plot formation. Results suggest a central role for the brain's default mode network related to comprehension of coherent narratives while incoherent episodes rather activate the frontoparietal control network. Moreover, an analysis of cortical activity as a function of the cumulative integration of narrative material into a coherent story reveals to linear modulations of right hemisphere posterior temporal and parietal regions. Together these findings point to key neural mechanisms involved in the fundamental human capacity for cumulative plot formation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Thirty-six native English speakers who were bilingual were scanned with high resolution MM. After MM signal intensity inhomogeneity correction, we applied both voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and surface-based morphometry (SBM) approaches to the data. VBM analysis was performed using FSL's standard VBM processing pipeline. For the SBM analysis, we utilized a semi-automated sulci delineation procedure, registered the brains to an atlas, and extracted measures of twenty four pre-selected regions of interest. We addressed three questions: (1) Which areas are more susceptible to differences in AoA? (2) How do AoA, proficiency and current level of exposure work together in predicting structural differences in the brain? And (3) What is the direction of the effect of AoA on regional volumetric and surface measures? Both VBM and SBM results suggested that earlier second language exposure was associated with larger volumes in the right parietal cortex. Consistently, SBM showed that the cortical area of the right superior parietal lobule increased as AoA decreased. In contrast, in the right pars orbitalis of the inferior frontal gyrus, AoA, proficiency, and current level of exposure are equally important in accounting for the structural differences. We interpret our results in terms of current theory and research on the effects of L2 learning on brain structures and functions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The Ultimatum Game (UG) is a social decision-making paradigm that provides a framework for studying interpersonal conflict over division of monetary resources. Unfair monetary UG-offers elicit anger and while accepting them engages regulatory processes, rejecting them is regarded as an aggressive retribution. Ventro-medial prefrontal-cortex (vmPFC) activity has been shown to relate to idiosyncratic tendencies in accepting unfair offers possibly through its role in emotion regulation. Nevertheless, standard UG paradigms lack fundamental aspects of real-life social interactions in which one reacts to other people in a response contingent fashion. To uncover the neural substrates underlying the tendency to accept anger-infused ultimatum offers during dynamic social interactions, we incorporated on-line verbal negotiations with an obnoxious partner in a repeated-UG during fMRI scanning. We hypothesized that vmPFC activity will differentiate between individuals with high or low monetary gains accumulated throughout the game and reflect a divergence in the associated emotional experience. We found that as individuals gained more money, they reported less anger but also more positive feelings and had slower sympathetic response. In addition, high-gain individuals had increased vmPFC activity, but also decreased brainstem activity, which possibly reflected the locus coeruleus. During the more angering unfair offers, these individuals had increased dorsal-posterior Insula (dpI) activity which functionally coupled to the medial-thalamus (mT). Finally, both vmPFC activity and dpI-mT connectivity contributed to increased gain, possibly by modulating the ongoing subjective emotional experience. These ecologically valid findings point towards a neural mechanism that might nurture pro-social interactions by modulating an individual's dynamic emotional experience. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Nineteen healthy subjects underwent resting-state fMRI and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI). For the brain network analysis, the SN, RN and DN were positioned on susceptibility weighted images and used as seeds for temporal correlations analyzed via BOLD data. T-tests were performed for the correlation coefficients of each seed. We demonstrated that the SN, RN and DN were functionally connected to each other, and, in general, their connectivity maps overlapped in a series of subcortical extrapyramidal structures and regions of cerebral cortices. A Granger causality analysis indicated that the effective connectivity graphs within extrapyramidal structures mainly exhibited a spacial up-down pattern for the positive and negative influences, respectively. Our findings suggest that extensive regions involved in the extrapyramidal system constituted a relatively exclusive network via spatial-temporal correlation signals that analogously corresponded to the anatomical structures. The investigation of extrapyramidal system networks may have potential clinical implications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In this study, we test whether reward sensitivity can be redirected to promote safe behavior. Adolescents completed a risk-taking task in the presence of their mother and alone during fMRI. Adolescents demonstrated reduced risk-taking behavior when their mothers were present compared with alone, which was associated with greater recruitment of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) when making safe decisions, decreased activation in the ventral striatum following risky decisions and greater functional coupling between the ventral striatum and VLPFC when making safe decisions. Importantly, the very same neural circuitry (i.e. ventral striatum) that has been linked to greater risk-taking can also be redirected toward thoughtful, more deliberative and safe decisions.","[Telzer, Eva H.; Ichien, Nicholas T.; Qu, Yang] Univ Illinois, Dept Psychol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Telzer, Eva H.] Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Technol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Telzer, EH (reprint author), 603 E Daniel St, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.","ehtelzer@illinois.edu","","","National Science Foundation [SES 1459719]; Department of Psychology at the University of Illinois","We greatly appreciate the assistance of the Biomedical Imaging Center.

One example is warfare, where killing enemy soldiers is seen as morally justified. Yet, the neural underpinnings distinguishing between justified and unjustified killing are largely unknown. To improve understanding of the neural processes involved in justified and unjustified killing, participants had to imagine being the perpetrator whilst watching 'first-person perspective' animated videos where they shot enemy soldiers ('justified violence') and innocent civilians ('unjustified violence'). When participants imagined themselves shooting civilians compared with soldiers, greater activation was found in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Regression analysis revealed that the more guilt participants felt about shooting civilians, the greater the response in the lateral OFC. Effective connectivity analyses further revealed an increased coupling between lateral OFC and the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) when shooting civilians. The results show that the neural mechanisms typically implicated with harming others, such as the OFC, become less active when the violence against a particular group is seen as justified.

A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) based technology with potential clinical application is the study of resting state brain connectivity. We tested if resting state connectivity may predict choice behavior in a social context. Twenty-nine healthy adults underwent resting state fMRI before performing the Trust Game, a two person monetary exchange game. We assessed the ability of patterns of resting-state functional brain organization, demographic characteristics and a measure of moral development, the Defining Issues Test (DIT-2), to predict individuals' decisions to reciprocate money during the Trust Game. Subjects reciprocated in 74.9% of the trials. Independent component analysis identified canonical resting-state networks. Increased functional connectivity between the salience (bilateral insula/anterior cingulate) and central executive (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex/ posterior parietal cortex) networks significantly predicted the choice to reciprocate pro-social behavior (R-2= 0.20, p = 0.015). Stepwise linear regression analysis showed that functional connectivity between these two networks (p = 0.002), age (p = 0.007) and DIT-2 personal interest schema score (p = 0.032) significantly predicted reciprocity behavior (R-2 = 0.498, p = 0.001). Intrinsic functional connectivity between neural networks in conjunction with other individual characteristics may be a valuable tool for predicting performance during social interactions. Future replication and temporal extension of these findings may bolster the understanding of decision making in clinical, financial and marketing settings. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, very little is known about how direct gaze is processed during live interaction with a real partner. Here, for the first time we used an experimental setup allowing the participant inside an MRI scanner to interact face-to-face with a partner located in the scanner room. Depending on condition, the participant and the partner were instructed either to look at each other in the eyes or to direct their gaze away from the other. As control conditions, participants gazed at their own eyes, reflected in a mirror, or gazed at a picture of the partner's eyes. Results revealed that direct gaze by the partner was associated with activity in areas involved in production and comprehension of language and action, including the IFG, the premotor cortex (PM), and the supplementary motor area (SMA). Activations in these areas were observed regardless of the participant's gaze behavior. In contrast, increased activity in arMPFC, an area involved in inference of other mental states during social interaction and communication, was only observed when the participant reciprocated the partner's direct gaze so as to establish mutual gaze. Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis revealed effective connectivity between the IFG and the arMPFC during mutual gaze. This suggests that, within a larger network concerned with the processing of social gaze, mutual gaze with a real partner is established by an increased coupling between areas involved in the detection of communicative intentions, language, and social interaction.

Here, we used fMRI with human participants to examine whether an individual's neural representation of an imagined primary reward predicts the degree to which the value of delayed monetary payments is discounted. Because future rewards can never be experienced at the time of choice, imagining or simulating the benefits of a future reward may play a critical role in decisions between alternatives with either immediate or delayed benefits. We found that enhanced ventromedial prefrontal cortex response during imagined primary reward receipt was correlated with reduced discounting in a separate monetary intertemporal choice task. Furthermore, activity in enhanced ventromedial prefrontal cortex during reward imagination predicted temporal discounting behavior both between- and within-individual decision makers with 62% and 73% mean balanced accuracy, respectively. These results suggest that the quality of reward imagination may impact the degree to which future outcomes are discounted.","[Hakimi, Shabnam] CALTECH, Computat & Neural Syst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Hare, Todd A.] CALTECH, Div Humanities, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Hare, Todd A.] CALTECH, Social Sci Div, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Hare, Todd A.] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Lab Social & Neural Syst Res, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland","Hare, TA (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Lab Social & Neural Syst Res, Blumlisalpstr 10, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.","todd.hare@econ.uzh.ch","Hare, Todd/E-7091-2017","Hare, Todd/0000-0002-0260-2772; Hakimi, Shabnam/0000-0003-4122-6041","NIMH NIH HHS [P50 MH094258]; NIA NIH HHS [R21 AG038866]","","","25","7","8","2","22","SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474","","","J NEUROSCI","J.

Observing unexpected movements, as defined by the context, often elicits greater activity, particularly in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). This implies that observers use contextual information to form expectations about an agents goal and subsequent movements. The current study sought to identify regions that support the formation of these context-dependent expectations, with the pSTS being one candidate, given the consistent contextual modulation of its activity. We presented participants with fictitious individuals who had emotion-dependent food preferences, and instructed participants to indicate which food they expected each individual to choose based on the individual's current emotional state. Each individual's preference and emotional state therefore created a context that informed the observer's expectation of the individual's choice. Multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) was used to assess if these different contexts could be discriminated in the pSTS and elsewhere in the brain. No evidence for context discrimination was found in the pSTS. Context discrimination was found instead a network of other brain regions including the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (amPFC), bilateral parietal cortex, left middle temporal gyrus (L MTG) and left anterior temporal lobe (L ATL), which have been previously associated with context processing, and semantic and memory retrieval. All together, these regions possibly support the formation of context dependent expectations of an agent's goal.","[Lee, Su Mei; McCarthy, Gregory] Yale Univ, Dept Psychol, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","McCarthy, G (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Psychol, 2 Hillhouse Ave, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.","gregory.mccarthy@yale.edu","","","National Institutes of Health [MH005286]; Yale University Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) Imaging Fund","We thank Na Yeon Kim for assistance with data collection.

The brain structures involved in empathy for physical pain include the anterior insula (Al), and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). High empathy may lead people to undertake pro social behavior. It is important to understand how this process can be changed, and what factors these empathic responses depend on. Physical attractiveness is a major social and evolutional cue, playing a role in the formation of interpersonal evaluation. The aim of the study was to determine how attractiveness affects the level of empathy both in relation to self-rated behavior and in terms of activation of specific empathy-related brain regions. Twenty-seven subjects (14 female and 13 male) were studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method while they were watching short video scenes involving physically more and less attractive men and women who exhibited pain responses. In the absence of behavioral effects in compassion ratings, we observed stronger activation in empathic brain structures (ACC; Al) for less attractive men and for attractive women than for attractive men. Evolutionary psychology studies suggest that beauty is valued more highly in females than males, which might lead observers to empathize more strongly with the attractive woman than the men. Attractive mens' faces are typically associated with enhanced masculine facial characteristics and are considered to possess fewer desirable personality traits compared with feminized faces. This could explain why more empathy was shown to less attractive men. In conclusion, the study showed that the attractiveness and sex of a model are important modulators of empathy for pain.","[Jankowiak-Siuda, Kamila; Rymarczyk, Krystyna] Univ Social Sci & Humanities, Fac Psychol, Inst Cognit & Behav Neurosci, Dept Expt Neuropsychol, PL-03815 Warsaw, Poland; [Rymarczyk, Krystyna; Zurawski, Lukasz; Jednorog, Katarzyna] Nencki Inst Expt Biol, Dept Neurophysiol, Psychophysiol Lab, Warsaw, Poland; [Marchewka, Artur] Nencki Inst Expt Biol, Neurobiol Ctr, Lab Brain Imaging, Warsaw, Poland","Jankowiak-Siuda, K (reprint author), Univ Social Sci & Humanities, Fac Psychol, Inst Cognit & Behav Neurosci, Dept Expt Neuropsychol, Chodakowska St 19-31, PL-03815 Warsaw, Poland.","kjankowiak-siuda@swps.edu.pl","","Rymarczyk, Krystyna/0000-0002-4085-9480; Marchewka, Artur/0000-0002-1982-3299; Jednorog, Katarzyna/0000-0003-3072-6956","Ministry of Science and Higher Education [NN 106361740]; European Regional Development Fund as part of the Innovative Economy Operational Programme","This work was supported by the Grant Ministry of Science and Higher Education under Grant number NN 106361740.

Healthy young volunteers performed a reinforcement learning task where they chose one of two fractal stimuli associated with monetary gain (reward trials) or avoidance of monetary loss (avoidance trials). Trait sensitivity to reward and punishment was assessed using the behavioral inhibition/ activation scales (BIS/BAS). Functional neuroimaging results showed activation of the striatum during the anticipation and reception periods of reward trials. During avoidance trials, activation of the dorsal striatum and prefrontal regions was found. As expected, individual differences in reward sensitivity were positively associated with activation in the left and right ventral striatum during reward reception. Individual differences in sensitivity to punishment were negatively associated with activation in the left dorsal striatum during avoidance anticipation and also with activation in the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex during receiving monetary loss. These results suggest that learning to attain reward and learning to avoid loss are dependent on separable sets of neural regions whose activity is modulated by trait sensitivity to reward or punishment.","[Kim, Sang Hee; Yoon, HeungSik] Korea Univ, Dept Brain & Cognit Engn, Seoul 136713, South Korea; [Kim, Hackjin] Korea Univ, Dept Psychol, Seoul 136701, South Korea; [Hamann, Stephan] Emory Univ, Dept Psychol, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA","Kim, SH (reprint author), Korea Univ, Dept Brain & Cognit Engn, Sci Lib 604B, Seoul 136713, South Korea.","sangheekim.ku@gmail.com","","","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, the Republic of Korea [2012R1A2A2A01012159]","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, the Republic of Korea (2012R1A2A2A01012159).","","59","17","17","2","22","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

The conceptual act theory of emotion hypothesizes that an instance of emotion is a brain state constructed from the interaction of domain-general, core systems within the brain such as the salience, default mode and frontoparietal control networks. Using peak coordinates derived from a meta-analysis of task-evoked emotion fMRI studies, we generated a set of whole-brain rs-fcMRI 'discovery' maps for each emotion category and examined the spatial overlap in their conjunctions. Instead of discovering a specific network for each emotion category, variance in the discovery maps was accounted for by the known domain-general network. Furthermore, the salience network is observed as part of every emotion category.

Previous studies have shown that the response of the amygdala to emotionally arousing stimuli can be modulated by sex hormones. Because oral contraceptive pills dramatically lower circulating sex hormone levels with potent analogs of those hormones, we performed a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment to measure amygdala reactivity in response to emotional stimuli in women using oral contraceptives, and compared their amygdala reactivity with that of naturally cycling women. Here, we show that women who use oral contraceptive pills have significantly decreased bilateral amygdala reactivity in response to negatively valenced, emotionally arousing stimuli compared with naturally cycling women.

Recent evidence suggests that this mode regulation can be problematic in the context of regulation of emotion elicited by the suffering of others, resulting in reduced emotional connectedness. Here, we investigated the effects of an alternative emotion regulation technique based on the up-regulation of positive affect via Compassion-meditation on experiential and neural affective responses to depictions of individuals in distress, and compared these with the established emotion regulation strategy of Reappraisal. Using fMRI, we scanned 15 expert practitioners of Compassion-meditation either passively viewing, or using Compassion-meditation or Reappraisal to modulate their emotional reactions to film clips depicting people in distress. Both strategies effectively, but differentially regulated experienced affect, with Compassion primarily increasing positive and Reappraisal primarily decreasing negative affect. Imaging results showed that Compassion, relative to both passive-viewing and Reappraisal increased activation in regions involved in affiliation, positive affect and reward processing including ventral striatum and medial orbitfrontal cortex. This network was shown to be active prior to stimulus presentation, suggesting that the regulatory mechanism of Compassion is the stimulus-independent endogenous generation of positive affect.","[Engen, Haakon G.; Singer, Tania] Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Dept Social Neurosci, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany","Engen, HG (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Dept Social Neurosci, Stephanstr 1a, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.","engen@cbs.mpg.de","","","European Research Council under European Community/ERC [205557]","The authors would like to thank Tor Wager and Luka Ruzic for their help with the subcortical rendering scripts.

According to a recent experiment, the similarity of perirhinal fMRI response patterns to written concrete words is higher for words which are more similar in their meaning. If left perirhinal cortex functions as an amodal semantic hub, one would predict that this semantic similarity effect would extend to the spoken modality. We conducted an event-related fMRI experiment and evaluated whether a same semantic similarity effect could be obtained for spoken as for written words. Twenty healthy subjects performed a property verification task in either the written or the spoken modality. Words corresponded to concrete animate entities for which extensive feature generation was available from more than 1000 subjects. From these feature generation data, a concept-feature matrix was derived which formed the basis of a cosine similarity matrix between the entities reflecting their similarity in meaning (called the ""semantic cossimilarity matrix""). Independently, we calculated a cosine similarity matrix between the left perirhinal fMRI activity patterns evoked by the words (called the ""fMRI cossimilarity matrix""). Next, the similarity was determined between the semantic cossimilarity matrix and the fMRI cossimilarity matrix. This was done for written and spoken words pooled, for written words only, for spoken words only, as well as for crossmodal pairs. Only for written words did the fMRI cossimilarity matrix correlate with the semantic cossimilarity matrix. Contrary to our prediction, we did not find any such effect for auditory word input nor did we find cross-modal effects in perirhinal cortex between written and auditory words. Our findings situate the contribution of left perirhinal cortex to word processing at the top of the visual processing pathway, rather than at an amodal stage where visual and auditory word processing pathways have already converged.

Here, we investigated how mPFC might support the ability to recollect information about oneself and others relating to previous experiences. Participants judged whether they had previously related stimuli conceptually to themselves or someone else, or whether they or another agent had performed actions. We uncovered a functional distinction between dorsal and ventral mPFC subregions based on information retrieved from episodic long-term memory. The dorsal mPFC was generally activated when participants attempted to retrieve social information about themselves and others, regardless of whether this information concerned the conceptual or agentic self or other. In contrast, a role was discerned for ventral mPFC during conceptual but not agentic self-referential recollection, indicating specific involvement in retrieving memories related to self-concept rather than bodily self. A subsequent recognition test for new items that had been presented during the recollection task found that conceptual and agentic recollection attempts resulted in differential incidental encoding of new information. Thus, we reveal converging fMRI and behavioral evidence for distinct neurocognitive forms of self-referential recollection, highlighting that conceptual and bodily aspects of self-reflection can be dissociated.","[Bergstroem, Zara M.; Vogelsang, David A.; Simons, Jon S.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Psychol, Cambridge CB2 3EB, England; [Bergstroem, Zara M.; Vogelsang, David A.; Simons, Jon S.] Univ Cambridge, Behav & Clin Neurosci Inst, Cambridge CB2 3EB, England; [Bergstroem, Zara M.] Univ Kent, Keynes Coll, Sch Psychol, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England; [Benoit, Roland G.] Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Simons, JS (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Psychol, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EB, England.","jss30@cam.ac.uk","","Bergstrom, Zara/0000-0001-8794-0182; Simons, Jon/0000-0002-7508-9084","BBSRC [BB/G014795/1]; James S McDonnell Foundation; University of Cambridge's RCUK; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/G014795/1]; Medical Research Council [G0001354, G1000183B, G0001354B]","This work was supported by the BBSRC [grant number BB/G014795/1] and the James S McDonnell Foundation.

In each round of this competitive reaction time task, participants observed their opponent while he selected a punishment level for him, bearing either a neutral or angry facial expression. Afterward, participants in turn selected a punishment level for their opponent. Across participants, reactivity of the medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) to angry facial expressions was negatively related to aggressive behavior. Within participants and across trials, activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was positively related to aggressive behavior specifically in response to angry expressions. Moreover, we found an effect of angry expressions on neural activity patterns during later stages of the task, demonstrating that the effect of angry expressions on neural reactivity is more than just a short-lived, stimulus-driven response.

To explore this issue, we measured neural activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while participants sex-categorized congruent as well as incongruent person dyads (i.e., two people interacting in a plausible or implausible manner). Incongruent person dyads elicited enhanced neural processing in several high-level visual areas dedicated to face and body encoding and in the posterior middle temporal gyrus compared to congruent person dyads. Incongruent and congruent person scenes were also successfully differentiated by a linear multivariate pattern classifier in the right fusiform body area and the left extrastriate body area. Finally, increases in the person scenes' meaningfulness as judged by independent observers was accompanied by enhanced activity in the bilateral posterior insula. These findings demonstrate that the processing of person scenes goes beyond a mere stimulus-bound encoding of their partaking agents, suggesting that changes in relations between agents affect their representation in category-selective regions of the visual cortex and beyond.

We tested for hippocampal contributions to an implicit expression of configural/relational memory for complex scenes using eye-movement tracking during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. Participants studied scenes and were later tested using scenes that resembled study scenes in their overall feature configuration but comprised different elements. These configurally similar scenes were used to limit explicit memory, and were intermixed with new scenes that did not resemble studied scenes. Scene configuration memory was expressed through eye movements reflecting exploration overlap (EO), which is the viewing of the same scene locations at both study and test. EO reliably discriminated similar study-test scene pairs from study-new scene pairs, was reliably greater for similarity-based recognition hits than for misses, and correlated with hippocampal fMRI activity. In contrast, subjects could not reliably discriminate similar from new scenes by overt judgments, although ratings of familiarity were slightly higher for similar than new scenes. Hippocampal fMRI correlates of this weak explicit memory were distinct from EO-related activity. These findings collectively suggest that EO was an implicit expression of scene configuration memory associated with hippocampal activity. Visual exploration can therefore reflect implicit hippocampal-related memory processing that can be observed in eye-movement behavior during naturalistic scene viewing.

In line with suggestions of a common neural network involved in the processing of physical pain and negative and distressing stimuli, like social rejection as a psychologically harmful event, we examined the influence of the A118G polymorphism on the neural processing of physical and non-physical pain. Using fMRI, we investigated a sample of 23 females with the more frequent AA genotype, and eight females with the relatively rare but more pain-sensitive AG genotype during electrical stimulation to the dorsum of the non-dominant hand. Non-physical pain was investigated using Cyberball, a virtual ball-tossing game, to induce experiences of non-self-dependent social rejection. A Go/NoGo task with an increased risk of self-dependent erroneous performance was used as a control task to investigate the effects of negative feedback as a more cognitive form of distress. Relative to A118G homozygous A-allele carriers, G-allele carriers showed significantly increased activation of the supplementary motor area/superior frontal gyrus and the precentral gyrus during electrical stimulation. Increased activation of the secondary sensorimotor cortex (SII) was found during social exclusion and during negative feedback. We demonstrate that brain regions particularly related to the somatosensory component of pain processing are modulated by variations in OPRM1.

This is striking because models that require sequential independence among residuals are regularly implemented. The aim of the current study was (a) to apply to directed functional connectivity maps of functional magnetic resonance imaging data an a posteriori model validation procedure (i.e., white noise tests of one-step-ahead prediction errors combined with decision criteria for revising the maps based upon Lagrange Multiplier tests), and (b) to demonstrate how the procedure applies to single-subject simulated, single-subject task-related, and multi-subject resting state data. Directed functional connectivity was determined by the unified structural equation model family of approaches in order to map contemporaneous and first order lagged connections among brain regions at the group- and individual-levels while incorporating external input, then white noise tests were run. Findings revealed that the validation procedure successfully detected unmodeled sequential dependencies among residuals and recovered higher order (greater than one) simulated connections, and that the procedure can accommodate task-related input. Findings also revealed that lags greater than one were present in resting state data: With a group-level network that contained only contemporaneous and first order connections, 44% of subjects required second order, individual-level connections in order to obtain maps with white noise residuals. Results have broad methodological relevance (e.g., temporal validation is necessary after directed functional connectivity analyses because the presence of unmodeled higher order sequential dependencies may bias parameter estimates) and substantive implications (e.g., higher order lags may be common in resting state data).","[Beltz, Adriene M.; Molenaar, Peter C.

Results from three different analyses revealed both common brain networks of activation across decision mode and differential activations as a function of strategy adherence.

Participants watched videos of performers engaged in modern dance or pantomime that conveyed specific themes such as hope, agony, lust, or exhaustion. We tested whether the meaning of an effectively laden performance was decoded in localized brain substrates as a distinct property of action separable from other superficial features, such as choreography, kinematics, performer, and low-level visual stimuli. A repetition suppression (RS) procedure was used to identify brain regions that decoded the meaningful affective state of a performer, as evidenced by decreased activity when emotive themes were repeated in successive performances. Because the theme was the only feature repeated across video clips that were otherwise entirely different, the occurrence of RS identified brain substrates that differentially coded the specific meaning of expressive performances. RS was observed bilaterally, extending anteriorly along middle and superior temporal gyri into temporal pole, medially into insula, rostrally into inferior orbitofrontal cortex, and caudally into hippocampus and amygdale. Behavioral data on a separate task indicated that interpreting themes from modern dance was more difficult than interpreting pantomime; a result that was also reflected in the fMRI data. There was greater RS in left hemisphere, suggesting that the more abstract metaphors used to express themes in dance compared to pantomime posed a greater challenge to brain substrates directly involved in decoding those themes. We propose that the meaning-sensitive temporal-orbitofrontal regions observed here comprise a superordinate functional module of a known hierarchical action observation network (AON), which is critical to the construction of meaning from expressive movement. The findings are discussed with respect to a predictive coding model of action understanding.","[Tipper, Christine M.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Psychiat, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Tipper, Christine M.] Child & Family Res Inst, Mental Hlth & Integrated Neurobehav Dev Res Core, Vancouver, BC V5Z 4H4, Canada; [Signorini, Giulia] St John God Clin Res Ctr, Psychiat Epidemiol & Evaluat Unit, Brescia, Italy; [Grafton, Scott T.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Tipper, CM (reprint author), Child & Family Res Inst, Mental Hlth & Integrated Neurobehav Dev Res Core, 3rd Floor,938 West 28th Ave, Vancouver, BC V5Z 4H4, Canada.","ctipper@cfri.ubc.ca","Signorini, Giulia/J-7728-2016","Signorini, Giulia/0000-0003-1341-4598; Tipper, Christine Marie/0000-0003-1666-9203","James S.

Yet the neural mechanisms by which stress influences self-control choices are unclear. We investigated these mechanisms in human participants who faced self-control dilemmas over food reward while undergoing fMRI following stress. We found that stress increased the influence of immediately rewarding taste attributes on choice and reduced self-control. This choice pattern was accompanied by increased functional connectivity between ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and amygdala and striatal regions encoding tastiness. Furthermore, stress was associated with reduced connectivity between the vmPFC and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex regions linked to self-control success. Notably, alterations in connectivity pathways could be dissociated by their differential relationships with cortisol and perceived stress. Our results indicate that stress may compromise self-control decisions by both enhancing the impact of immediately rewarding attributes and reducing the efficacy of regions promoting behaviors that are consistent with long-term goals.","[Maier, Silvia U.; Makwana, Aidan B.; Hare, Todd A.] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Lab Social & Neural Syst Res, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland","Maier, SU (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Lab Social & Neural Syst Res, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.","silvia.maier@econ.uzh.ch; todd.hare@econ.uzh.ch","Hare, Todd/E-7091-2017","Hare, Todd/0000-0002-0260-2772; Maier, Silvia/0000-0002-9759-8613","Swiss National Science Foundation [140277]; European Union [607310]","The authors thank Molly Crockett, Adriana Galvan, Marcus Gruschow, and Sarah Rudorf for helpful comments on the manuscript, as well as Lars Schwabe, Markus Heinrichs, and Bernadette von Dawans for advice on the stress induction setup.

In the present study, we used an fMRI technique to examine individuals as they played the Trust game in fair and unfair situations. Our results revealed that the social environment involving opportunities for exploiting others may be more demanding for Machiavellians who showed elevated brain activities in the fair condition (where the partner made a cooperative initiation) but not in the unfair condition. Regarding the specific activated brain areas in the fair condition, the HM's anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was responding, which is likely to be involved in the inhibition of the prepotent social-emotional response to the partner's cooperative initiative. Furthermore, we found increased activity in the HM subjects' inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), compared to LMs, that plays a crucial role in the evaluation of the signals associated with the others' social behavior, especially when the player faces a cooperative partner. Alternatively, although Machiavellians are regarded as poor mind readers, inferior frontal gyrus may be effective in anticipating their partner's subsequent decisions in the social dilemma situation.

To determine which default mode (DM) subnetworks are engaged by mentalizing processes, we assessed task-related recruitment of DM subnetworks. Spatial independent component analysis (sICA) applied to fMRI data using relatively high-order model (75 components). Healthy participants (n=53, ages 17-60) performed two fMRI tasks: an interactive game involving mentalizing (Domino), a semantic memory task (SORT), and a resting state fMRI scan. sICA of the two tasks split the DMN into 10 subnetworks located in three core regions: medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC; five subnetworks), posterior cingulate/precuneus (PCC/PrC; three subnetworks), and bilateral temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Mentalizing events increased recruitment in five of 10 DM subnetworks, located in all three core DMN regions. In addition, three of these five DM subnetworks, one dmPFC subnetwork, one PCC/PrC subnetwork, and the right TPJ subnetwork, showed reduced recruitment by semantic memory task events. The opposing modulation by the two tasks suggests that these three DM subnetworks are specifically engaged in mentalizing. Our findings, therefore, suggest the unique involvement of mentalizing processes in only three of 10 DM subnetworks, and support the importance of the dmPFC, PCC/PrC, and right TPJ in mentalizing as described in prior studies.

These inhibitory capacities develop throughout childhood, with growing evidence of important maturational changes occurring in adolescence. There also has been intense interest in the role of social adversity on the development of executive function, including inhibitory control. We hypothesized that the onset of adolescence could be a time of particular opportunity/vulnerability in the development of inhibition due to the large degree of maturational changes in neural systems involved in regulatory control. We investigated this hypothesis in a longitudinal study of adolescents by examining the impact of socioeconomic status (SES) on the maturation of inhibition and concurrent brain function. Furthermore, we examined gender as a potential moderator of this relationship, given evidence of gender-specificity in the developmental pathways of inhibition as well as sex differences in adolescent development. Results reveal that lower SES is associated with worse behavioral inhibition over time and a concurrent increase in anterior cingulate (ACC) activation, but only in girls. We also found that lower SES girls exhibited decreased ACC dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) coupling over time. Our findings suggest that female adolescents with lower SES appear to develop less efficient inhibitory processing in dlPFC, requiring greater and relatively unsuccessful compensatory recruitment of ACC. In summary, the present study provides a novel window into the neural mechanisms by which the influence of SES on inhibition may be transmitted during adolescence. Hum Brain Mapp 36:3194-3203, 2015.

The model generates several novel insights into the nature of altruism. It explains when and why generous choices are slower or faster than selfish choices, and why they produce greater response in TPJ and vmPFC, without invoking competition between automatic and deliberative processes or reward value for generosity. It also predicts that when one's own payoffs are valued more than others', some generous acts may reflect mistakes rather than genuinely pro-social preferences.","[Hutcherson, Cendri A.; Bushong, Benjamin; Rangel, Antonio] CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Rangel, Antonio] CALTECH, Computat & Neural Syst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Bushong, Benjamin] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hutcherson, Cendri A.] Univ Toronto, Dept Psychol, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada","Hutcherson, CA (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.","chutcher@hss.caltech.edu","","Hutcherson, Cendri/0000-0002-4441-4809","NSF-IGERT; NSF-Economics; NSF-DRMS; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Lipper Foundation","Matthew Rabin was an earlier collaborator on this project, which benefited greatly from his insight.

However, empirical evidence linking hippocampal activity to the perceptual experience of being physically located at a particular place in the environment is lacking. In this study, we used a multisensory out-of-body illusion to perceptually 'teleport' six healthy participants between two different locations in the scanner room during high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The participants were fitted with MRI-compatible head-mounted displays that changed their first-person visual perspective to that of a pair of cameras placed in one of two corners of the scanner room. To elicit the illusion of being physically located in this position, we delivered synchronous visuo-tactile stimulation in the form of an object moving toward the cameras coupled with touches applied to the participant's chest. Asynchronous visuo-tactile stimulation did not induce the illusion and served as a control condition. We found that illusory self-location could be successfully decoded from patterns of activity in the hippocampus in all of the participants in the synchronous (P < 0.05) but not in the asynchronous condition (P> 0.05). At the group-level, the decoding accuracy was significantly higher in the synchronous than in the asynchronous condition (P = 0.012). These findings associate hippocampal activity with the perceived location of the bodily self in space, which suggests that the human hippocampus is involved not only in spatial navigation and memory but also in the construction of our sense of bodily self-location.","[Guterstam, Arvid; Bjoernsdotter, Malin; Bergouignan, Loretxu; Gentile, Giovanni; Ehrsson, H.

We used complex network measures, derived from a brain-wide graph, to provide a comprehensive overview of age-related changes in functional connectivity. Functional connectivity in young and older participants was assessed during resting-state fMRI. The results show that aging has a large impact, not only on connectivity within functional networks but also on connectivity between the different functional networks in the brain. Brain networks in the elderly showed decreased modularity (less distinct functional networks) and decreased local efficiency. Connectivity decreased with age within networks supporting higher level cognitive functions, that is, within the default mode, cingulo-opercular and fronto-parietal control networks. Conversely, no changes in connectivity within the somatomotor and visual networks, networks implicated in primary information processing, were observed. Connectivity between these networks even increased with age.

Imaging studies have identified TPJ activation in association with many higher-order functions such as theory-of-mind, episodic memory, and attention, causing debate about the distribution of different processes. One major challenge is the lack of consensus about the anatomical location and extent of the TPJ. Here, we address this problem using data-driven analysis to test the hypothesis that the bilateral TPJ can be parcellated into subregions. We applied independent component analysis (ICA) to task-free fMRI data within a local region around the bilateral TPJ, iterating the ICA at multiple model orders and in several datasets. The localized analysis allowed finer separation of processes and the use of multiple dimensionalities provided qualitative information about lateralization. We identified four subdivisions that were bilaterally symmetrical and one that was right biased. To test whether the independent components (ICs) reflected true subdivisions, we performed functional connectivity analysis using the IC coordinates as seeds. This confirmed that the subdivisions belonged to distinct networks. The right-biased IC was connected with a network often associated with attentional processing. One bilateral subdivision was connected to sensorimotor regions and another was connected to auditory regions. One subdivision that presented as distinct left-and right-biased ICs was connected to frontoparietal regions. Another subdivision that also had left-and right-biased ICs was connected to social or default mode networks. Our results show that the TPJ in both hemispheres hosts multiple neural processes with connectivity patterns consistent with well developed specialization and lateralization.","Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Igelstrom, KM (reprint author), Princeton Neurosci Inst, Washington Rd, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.","kajsa@igelstrom.com","Igelstrom, Kajsa/J-3505-2012","Igelstrom, Kajsa/0000-0002-1904-5554","Princeton Neuroscience Institute Innovation Fund","This work was supported by the Princeton Neuroscience Institute Innovation Fund.

High NS is usually a predictor of risky behaviour such as drug abuse. However, the relationships between NS and risk-related cognitive processes, including individual risk preference and the brain activation associated with risk prediction, remain elusive. In this fMRI study, participants completed the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire to measure NS and performed a probabilistic decision making task. Using a mathematical model, we estimated individual risk preference. Brain regions associated with risk prediction were determined via fMRI. The NS score showed a positive correlation with risk preference and a negative correlation with the activation elicited by risk prediction in the right posterior insula (r-PI), left anterior insula (l-AI), right striatum (r-striatum) and supplementary motor area (SMA). Within these brain regions, only the activation associated with risk prediction in the r-PI showed a correlation with NS after controlling for the effect of risk preference. Resting-state functional connectivity between the r-PI and r-striatum/l-AI was negatively correlated with NS. Our results suggest that high NS may be associated with less aversion to risk and that the r-PI plays an important role in relating risk prediction to NS.","[Wang, Ying; Yang, Lizhuang; Gu, Feng; Li, Xiaoming; Zha, Rujing; Wei, Zhengde; Pei, Yakun; Zhou, Yifeng; Zhang, Xiaochu] Univ Sci & Technol China, Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Brain Funct & Dis, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Wang, Ying; Yang, Lizhuang; Gu, Feng; Li, Xiaoming; Zha, Rujing; Wei, Zhengde; Pei, Yakun; Zhou, Yifeng; Zhang, Xiaochu] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Life Sci, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Liu, Ying] Anhui Med Univ, Prov Hosp Affiliated, Hefei 230001, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiaoming] Anhui Med Univ, Dept Med Psychol, Hefei 230032, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Peng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Biophys, State Key Lab Brain & Cognit Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaochu] Chinese Acad Sci, Hefei Inst Phys Sci, Ctr Med Phys & Technol, Hefei 230031, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaochu] Univ Sci & Technol China, Ctr Biomed Engn, Hefei 230027, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaochu] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Human & Social Sci, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China","Zhang, XC (reprint author), Univ Sci & Technol China, Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Brain Funct & Dis, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China.","zxcustc@ustc.edu.cn","Yang, Li-Zhuang/F-3648-2016","Yang, Li-Zhuang/0000-0002-0192-4323; Wei, Zhengde/0000-0003-4586-0170","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31230032, 31171083, 31471071]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China [WK2070000033]; Natural Science Fund Project of Anhui Province [1208085MH179]; State Key Laboratory of Brain and Cognitive Science; 100 Talents Programme of The Chinese Academy of Sciences [BJ2070000047]","This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31230032, 31171083, 31471071), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (WK2070000033), Natural Science Fund Project of Anhui Province (1208085MH179), fund of State Key Laboratory of Brain and Cognitive Science, and 100 Talents Programme of The Chinese Academy of Sciences (BJ2070000047).

Our main aim was to disentangle brain activation for two different types of winning. Participants could either win a trial in a way that it increased their payoff; or they could win a trial in a way that it incurred a monetary loss to their opponent. Two distinct brain networks were engaged in these two types of winning. Wins with a monetary gain activated the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, an area associated with the processing of rewards. In contrast, avoidance of loss/other-related monetary loss evoked activation in areas related to mentalizing, such as the temporo-parietal junction and precuneus. However, both types of winnings shared activation in the striatum.

A common method is to regress the scalar individual response on imaging predictors, known as a scalar-on-image (SI) regression. Analysis and computation of such massive and noisy data with complex spatio-temporal correlation structure is challenging. In this article, motivated by a psychological study on human affective feelings using fMRI, we propose a joint Ising and Dirichlet Process (Ising-DP) prior within the framework of Bayesian stochastic search variable selection for selecting brain voxels in high-dimensional SI regressions. The Ising component of the prior makes use of the spatial information between voxels, and the DP component groups the coefficients of the large number of voxels to a small set of values and thus greatly reduces the posterior computational burden. To address the phase transition phenomenon of the Ising prior, we propose a new analytic approach to derive bounds for the hyperparameters, illustrated on 2- and 3-dimensional lattices. The proposed method is compared with several alternative methods via simulations, and is applied to the fMRI data collected from the KLIFF hand-holding experiment.","[Li, Fan; Wang, Quanli] Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Zhang, Tingting] Univ Virginia, Dept Stat, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Gonzalez, Marlen Z.; Maresh, Erin L.; Coan, James A.] Univ Virginia, Dept Psychol, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA","Li, F (reprint author), Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA.","fli@stat.duke.edu; tz3b@virginia.edu; quanli@stat.duke.edu; mzg7uv@virginia.edu; elm2cg@virginia.edu; jcoan@virginia.edu","","","U.S. NSF-DMS [1208983, 1209118, 1120756]; National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH080725]","Supported in part by the U.S. NSF-DMS Grant 1208983.; Supported in part by the U.S. NSF-DMS Grants 1209118 and 1120756.; Supported in part by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Grant R01MH080725.","","60","10","10","2","16","INST MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS","CLEVELAND","3163 SOMERSET DR, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA","1932-6157","","","ANN APPL STAT","Ann.

In addition, participants were assigned to 1 of 2 treatments in which they either did or did not receive advanced instructions about the principles of utilitarianism. In all cases, participants were asked to judge the proposed allocations as ""fair"" or ""unfair."" More brain activity was observed within the superior parietal lobe, angular gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and bilateral caudate nucleus when participants viewed scenarios depicting equal divisions of resources. Conversely, unequal resource divisions were associated with more activity in the inferior frontal gyrus and insula cortex. Furthermore, instructions about the principles of utilitarianism led to significant activation differences within the inferior frontal gyrus and the middle frontal gyrus. Significant differences in activity were also found within the inferior frontal cortex and anterior insula between medical and nonmedical scenarios.

Here, we suggest that a critical mechanism underlying this tendency is that socially sharing emotional experiences is in itself perceived as hedonically positive and thereby contributes to the regulation of individual emotions. We investigated the effect of social sharing of emotions on subjective feelings and neural activity by having pairs of friends view emotional (negative and positive) and neutral pictures either alone or with the friend. While the two friends remained physically separated throughout the experiment-with one undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging and the other performing the task in an adjacent room-they were made aware on a trial-by-trial basis whether they were seeing pictures simultaneously with their friend (shared) or alone (unshared). Ratings of subjective feelings were improved significantly when participants viewed emotional pictures together than alone, an effect that was accompanied by activity increase in ventral striatum and medial orbitofrontal cortex, two important components of the reward circuitry. Because these effects occurred without any communication or interaction between the friends, they point to an important proximate explanation for the basic human motivation to affiliate with others, particularly in emotional situations.","[Wagner, Ullrich; Galli, Lisa; Schott, Bjoern H.; Wold, Andrew; Walter, Henrik] Univ Med Berlin, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Div Mind & Brain Res, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Wagner, Ullrich] Univ Munster, Dept Psychol, D-48049 Munster, Germany; [Wold, Andrew] Berlin Sch Mind & Brain, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [van der Schalk, Job; Manstead, Antony S.

Here we sought to further assess the sensitivity of fTCD to language lateralisation by using a metalinguistic task which does not involve novel speech generation: rhyme judgement in response to written words. Line array judgement was included as a non-linguistic visuospatial task to examine the relative strength of left and right hemisphere lateralisation within the same individuals when output requirements of the tasks are matched. These externally paced tasks allowed us to manipulate the number of stimuli presented to participants and thus assess the influence of pace on the strength of lateralisation. In Experiment 1, 28 right-handed adults participated in rhyme and line array judgement tasks and showed reliable left and right lateralisation at the group level for each task, respectively. In Experiment 2 we increased the pace of the tasks, presenting more stimuli per trial. We measured laterality indices (LIs) from 18 participants who performed both linguistic and non-linguistic judgement tasks during the original 'slow' presentation rate (5 judgements per trial) and a fast presentation rate (10 judgements per trial). The increase in pace led to increased strength of lateralisation in both the rhyme and line conditions. Our results demonstrate for the first time that fTCD is sensitive to the left lateralised processes involved in metalinguistic judgements. Our data also suggest that changes in the strength of language lateralisation, as measured by fTCD, are not driven by articulatory demands alone. The current results suggest that at least one aspect of task difficulty, the pace of stimulus presentation, influences the strength of lateralisation during both linguistic and non-linguistic tasks.

However, little is known about the neuroscientific basis of this interplay between internal and external motivators. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the neural substrates of intrinsic motivation, operationalized as the free-choice time spent on a task when this was not required, and tested the neural and behavioral effects of external reward on intrinsic motivation. We found that increased duration of free-choice time was predicted by generally diminished neural responses in regions associated with cognitive and affective regulation. By comparison, the possibility of additional reward improved task accuracy, and specifically increased neural and behavioral responses following errors. Those individuals with the smallest neural responses associated with intrinsic motivation exhibited the greatest error-related neural enhancement under the external contingency of possible reward. Together, these data suggest that human performance is guided by a ""tonic"" and ""phasic"" relationship between the neural substrates of intrinsic motivation (tonic) and the impact of external incentives (phasic).","[Marsden, Karen E.] Baylor Coll Med, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Ma, Wei Ji] NYU, Ctr Neural Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Ma, Wei Ji] NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Deci, Edward L.; Ryan, Richard M.] Dept Clin & Social Sci Psychol, Rochester, NY USA; [Chiu, Pearl H.] Virginia Tech Carilion Res Inst, Roanoke, VA 24016 USA; [Chiu, Pearl H.] Virginia Tech, Dept Psychol, Blacksburg, VA USA","Chiu, PH (reprint author), Virginia Tech Carilion Res Inst, 2 Riverside Circle, Roanoke, VA 24016 USA.","pearlchiu@vtc.vt.edu","Deci, Edward/T-7048-2017","Deci, Edward/0000-0001-8246-8536; Ma, Wei Ji/0000-0002-9835-9083; Ryan, Richard M/0000-0002-2355-6154","National Institutes of Health [MH091872, MH087692]","This work was partially supported by the National Institutes of Health (Grant Nos.

Although many studies have investigated the mechanisms involved in emotion recognition, very little is currently known regarding the processes involved during emotion attribution decisions. Research on complementary ""emotion understanding"" mechanisms, including empathy and theory of mind, has demonstrated that emotion understanding decisions are often made through relatively emotion-or cognitive-based processing streams. The current study was designed to investigate the behavioral and brain mechanisms involved in emotion attribution decisions. We predicted that dual processes, emotional and cognitive, are engaged during emotion attribution decisions. Sixteen healthy adults completed the Interpersonal Reactivity Index to characterize individual differences in tendency to make emotion-versus cognitive-based interpersonal decisions. Participants then underwent functional MRI while making emotion attribution decisions. We found neuroimaging evidence that emotion attribution decisions engage a similar brain network as other forms of emotion understanding. Further, we found evidence in support of a dual processes model involved during emotion attribution decisions. Higher scores of personal distress were associated with quicker emotion attribution decisions and increased anterior insula activity. Conversely, higher scores in perspective taking were associated with delayed emotion attribution decisions and increased prefrontal cortex and premotor activity. These findings indicate that the making of emotion attribution decisions relies on dissociable emotional and cognitive processing streams within the brain.","[Haas, Brian W.; Anderson, Ian W.; Filkowski, Megan M.] Univ Georgia, Dept Psychol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Haas, Brian W.] Univ Georgia, Interdisciplinary Neurosci Grad Program, Athens, GA 30602 USA","Haas, BW (reprint author), Univ Georgia, Dept Psychol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.","bhaas@uga.edu","","","","","","50","3","3","2","38","AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","WASHINGTON","750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","1528-3542","1931-1516","","EMOTION","Emotion","JUN","2015","15","3","","","","","390","398","","10.1037/emo0000053","","","","9","Psychology, Experimental","Psychology","CI1ZS","WOS:000354544600014","25706827","","","","2019-02-21","searchterm","searchterm_records_2001-2500.txt"

A novel task was developed based on the results of a separate item selection study (n=125). Items were designed to generate dissonance by prompting participants to reflect on everyday personal experiences that were inconsistent with values they had expressed support for. One experimental condition (dissonance) and three control conditions (justification, consonance, and non-self-related inconsistency) were used for comparison. Items of all four types were presented to each participant (n=14) in a randomized design. The fMRI analysis used a whole-brain approach focusing on the moments dissonance was induced. Results showed that in comparison with the control conditions the dissonance experience led to higher levels of activation in several brain regions. Specifically dissonance was associated with increased neural activation in key brain regions including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), anterior insula, inferior frontal gyrus, and precuneus. This supports current perspectives that emphasize the role of anterior cingulate and insula in dissonance processing. Less extensive activation in the prefrontal cortex than in some previous studies is consistent with this study's emphasis on dissonance induction, rather than reduction. This article also contains a short review and comparison with other fMRI studies of cognitive dissonance.","[de Vries, Jan] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Byrne, Mark; Kehoe, Elizabeth] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Trinity Coll Inst Neurosci, Dublin 2, Ireland","de Vries, J (reprint author), Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, 24 DOlier St, Dublin 2, Ireland.","jan.devries@tcd.ie","","de Vries, Jan/0000-0001-5073-895X","Science Foundation Ireland; Trinity College Dublin Start Up Fund [R01333]","Thanks to Sojo Joseph (fMRI technician), Deborah Keane (research assistant), Jeff Cooper (some excellent advice), Simon Dunne (task programmer), and Patricia Devine for allowing us to use the Cognitive Dissonance Measure (Elliot & Devine, 1994).

Participants viewed videos of people answering general knowledge questions and judged each respondent's confidence in their answer. Our results suggest a distinct role of two neural networks known to support social inferences, the so-called mentalizing and the mirroring network. While activation in both networks underlies the processing of nonverbal cues, only activity in the mentalizing network, most notably the medial prefrontal cortex and the bilateral temporoparietal junction, is modulated by how confident the respondent is judged to be.

We examined the neural correlates of the facilitative effects of self-determined choice using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants played a game-like task involving a stopwatch with either a stopwatch they selected (self-determined-choice condition) or one they were assigned without choice (forced-choice condition). Our results showed that self-determined choice enhanced performance on the stopwatch task, despite the fact that the choices were clearly irrelevant to task difficulty. Neuroimaging results showed that failure feedback, compared with success feedback, elicited a drop in the vmPFC activation in the forced-choice condition, but not in the self-determined-choice condition, indicating that negative reward value associated with the failure feedback vanished in the self-determined-choice condition. Moreover, the vmPFC resilience to failure in the self-determined-choice condition was significantly correlated with the increased performance. Striatal responses to failure and success feedback were not modulated by the choice condition, indicating the dissociation between the vmPFC and striatal activation pattern.

The actor produced speech-associated iconic gestures (IC) or no gestures (NG) while he was visible either from an egocentric (ego) or from an allocentric (allo) position. Participants were asked to indicate via button press whether they felt addressed or not. We found a significant interaction of body orientation and gesture in addressment evaluations, indicating that participants evaluated IC-ego conditions as most addressing. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and left fusiform gyrus were stronger activated for egocentric versus allocentric actor position in gesture context. Activation increase in the ACC for IC-ego>IC-allo further correlated positively with increased addressment ratings in the egocentric gesture condition. Gesture-related activation increase in the supplementary motor area, left inferior frontal gyrus and right insula correlated positively with gesture-related increase of addressment evaluations in the egocentric context.

Ancillary measures assessed participants' analytical thinking, beliefs on dualism and free will, and admiration for different sciences. In Experiment 1, superfluous neuroscience information increased the judged quality of the argument for both good and bad explanations, whereas accompanying fMRI pictures had no impact above and beyond the neuroscience text, suggesting a bias that is conceptual rather than pictorial. Superfluous neuroscience information was more alluring than social science information (Experiment 2) and more alluring than information from prestigious ""hard sciences"" (Experiments 3 and 4). Analytical thinking did not protect against the neuroscience bias, nor did a belief in dualism or free will. We conclude that the ""allure of neuroscience"" bias is conceptual, specific to neuroscience, and not easily accounted for by the prestige of the discipline.

In light of the recent development of dyadic fMRI which can directly observe dyadic brain interacting in one MRI scanner, this paper aims to establish a new form of logic, dual logic, which provides a theoretical platform for deductive reasoning in a complementary dual system with emergence mechanism. Applying the dual logic in the dfMRI experimental design and data analysis, the exogenous and endogenous dual systems in the BOLD responses can be identified; the non-reciprocal responses in the dual system can be suppressed; a cerebral coordinate for reciprocal interaction can be generated. Elucidated by dual logic deductions, the cerebral coordinate for reciprocal interaction suggests: the exogenous and endogenous systems consist of the empathy network and the mentalization network respectively; the default-mode network emerges from the resting state to activation in the endogenous system during reciprocal interaction; the cingulate plays an essential role in the emergence from the exogenous system to the endogenous system. Overall, the dual logic deductions are supported by the dfMRI experimental results and are consistent with current literature.

The present study tested the possibility that long-term experience with Chinese language affects the fusiform laterality of English reading by comparing three samples: Chinese speakers, English speakers with Chinese experience, and English speakers without Chinese experience. We found that, when reading words in their respective native language, Chinese and English speakers without Chinese experience differed in functional laterality of the posterior fusiform region (right laterality for Chinese speakers, but left laterality for English speakers). More importantly, compared with English speakers without Chinese experience, English speakers with Chinese experience showed more recruitment of the right posterior fusiform cortex for English words and pseudowords, which is similar to how Chinese speakers processed Chinese. These results suggest that long-term experience with Chinese shapes the fusiform laterality of English reading and have important implications for our understanding of the cross-language influences in terms of neural organization and of the functions of different fusiform subregions in reading.

For this reason, it is argued, explanation cannot proceed at either level without tight coupling to the algorithmic and representation level. Even at this level, however, we argue that additional constraints relating to the decomposition of the cognitive system into a set of interacting subfunctions (i.e., a cognitive architecture) are required. Integrated cognitive architectures that permit abstract specification of the functions of components and that make contact with the neural level provide a powerful bridge for linking the algorithmic and representational level to both the computational level and the implementational level.","[Cooper, Richard P.] Univ London, Dept Psychol Sci, Ctr Computat Cognit & Modelling, London WC1E 7HX, England; [Peebles, David] Univ Huddersfield, Dept Behav & Social Sci, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England","Cooper, RP (reprint author), Univ London, Dept Psychol Sci, Ctr Cognit Computat & Modelling, London WC1E 7HX, England.","r.cooper@bbk.ac.uk","","Peebles, David/0000-0003-1008-9275","","","","53","7","7","1","14","WILEY-BLACKWELL","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1756-8757","1756-8765","","TOP COGN SCI","Top.

Anticipation of all affective clips engaged common regions including the anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, caudate, inferior parietal and prefrontal cortex that are associated with emotional experience, sustained attention and appraisal. In contrast, the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex, regions implicated in reward processing, were selectively engaged during anticipation of positive clips (depicting sexually explicit content) and the mid-insula, which has been linked to processing aversive stimuli, was selectively engaged during anticipation of aversive clips (depicting graphic medical procedures); these three areas were also activated during anticipation of 'uncertain' clips reflecting a broad preparatory response for both aversive and positive stimuli.

First, during an implicit condition, participants viewed a series of unacquainted persons and performed a task unrelated to HIV risk. In the following explicit condition, participants evaluated the HIV risk for each presented person. Contrasting responses for high and low HIV risk revealed that risky stimuli evoked enhanced activity in the anterior insula and medial prefrontal regions, which are involved in salience processing and frequently activated by threatening and negative affect-related stimuli. Importantly, neural regions responding to explicit HIV risk judgments were also enhanced in the implicit condition, suggesting a neural mechanism for intuitive impressions of riskiness.

Cognitive reappraisal was assessed with the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) prior to experimental induction, and state mindfulness was assessed immediately following induction using the Toronto Mindfulness Scale. Participants practiced their assigned strategy for 1 week and then were reassessed with the ERQ reappraisal subscale. Participants receiving mindfulness training reported significantly higher levels of state mindfulness than participants in the thought suppression and mind wandering conditions. Although brief mindfulness training did not lead to significantly greater increases in reappraisal than the other two conditions, state mindfulness during mindfulness meditation was prospectively associated with increases in reappraisal. Path analysis revealed that the indirect effect between mindfulness training and reappraisal was significant through state mindfulness. Degree of state mindfulness achieved during the act of mindfulness meditation significantly predicted increases in reappraisal over time, suggesting that mindfulness may promote emotion regulation by enhancing cognitive reappraisal.","[Garland, Eric L.] Univ Utah, Coll Social Work, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Garland, Eric L.] Univ Utah, Huntsman Canc Inst, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Hanley, Adam] Florida State Univ, Dept Educ, Tallassee, FL USA; [Farb, Norman A.] Univ Toronto, Dept Psychol, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Froeliger, Brett] Med Univ S Carolina, Hollings Canc Ctr, Dept Neurosci, Charleston, SC 29425 USA","Garland, EL (reprint author), Univ Utah, Coll Social Work, 395 South,1500 East, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.","eric.garland@socwk.utah.edu","","Froeliger, Brett/0000-0001-9451-9900","National Institutes of Health [R03DA032517, R34DA037005]","E.L.G. was supported grants R03DA032517 and R34DA037005 from the National Institutes of Health in preparing this manuscript.

Several explanatory approaches have been suggested to explain the source of this phenomenon, including perspective taking abilities or ingroup identification. Knowledge about its biological bases, however, is scarce. To gain a better understanding, the present study investigated neural activation patterns in response to video clips from reality TV shows. Reality TV is well known for presenting social norm violations, flaws and pratfalls of its protagonists in real life situations thereby qualifying as an ecological valid trigger for VE. Methods: N = 60 healthy participants viewed stand stills from previously watched video clips taken from German reality TV-shows while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. The clips were preselected for high versus low VE content in a pilot study. Besides the investigation of differences in brain activation elicited by VE versus control stand stills (blocked design contrast), we performed additional exploratory functional connectivity analyses (psychophysiological interaction; PPI) to detect VE related brain networks. Results: Compared to the low VE condition, participants in the high VE condition showed a higher activation in the middle temporal gyrus, the supramarginal gyrus, the right inferior frontal gyrus and the gyrus rectus. Functional connectivity analyses confirmed increased connectivity of these regions with the anterior cingulate in the VE condition. Moreover, self-ratings of VE and brain activity were correlated positively. Conclusion: Reality TV formats with high VE content activate brain regions associated with Theory of Mind, but also with empathic concern and social identity. Therefore, our results support the idea that the ability to put oneself in other person's shoes is a major prerequisite for VE. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Empathic processing varies across the human population, however it is currently unclear how personality traits are associated with empathic processing. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that specific personality traits are associated with behavioral and biological indicators of improved empathy. Extraversion and Agreeableness are personality traits designed to measure individual differences in social-cognitive functioning, however each trait-dimension includes elements that represent interpersonal social functioning and elements that do not represent interpersonal social functioning. We tested the prediction that interpersonal elements of Extraversion (Warmth) and Agreeableness (Altruism) are associated with empathy and non-interpersonal elements of Extraversion and Agreeableness are not associated with empathy. We quantified empathic processing behaviorally (empathic accuracy task using video vignettes) and within the brain (fMRI and an emotional perspective taking task) in 50 healthy subjects. Converging evidence shows that highly warm and altruistic people are well skilled in recognizing the emotional states of other people and exhibit greater activity in brain regions important for empathy (temporoparietal junction and medial prefrontal cortex) during emotional perspective taking. A mediation analysis further supported the association between warm-altruistic personality and empathic processing; indicating that one reason why highly warm-altruistic individuals may be skilled empathizers is that they engage the temporoparietal junction and medial prefrontal cortex more. Together, these findings advance the way the behavioral and neural basis of empathy is understood and demonstrates the efficacy of personality scales to measure individual differences in interpersonal social function.","[Haas, Brian W.; Remillard, Laura; Ishak, Alexandra; Anderson, Ian W.; Filkowski, Megan M.] Univ Georgia, Dept Psychol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Haas, Brian W.] Univ Georgia, Interdisciplinary Neurosci Grad Program, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Brook, Michael] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Chicago, IL USA","Haas, BW (reprint author), Univ Georgia, Dept Psychol, Athens, GA 30602 USA.","bhaas@uga.edu","","","University of Georgia, Office of the Vice President for Research","Funding: This study was funded by the University of Georgia, Office of the Vice President for Research.

Results: Results demonstrate a subsequent process of increased impulsive decision-making following a prior exposure to both high positive and negative arousal stimuli, compared to the experiment subjects' experiences with neutral stimuli. Findings indicate that increased impulsive decision-making behaviors can occur with high arousal and can be characterized by decreased activities in the cognitive control regions such as prefronto-parietal regions.

Dopamine has long been suggested to play a key role in the integrity of such representations, with D2-receptor activation rendering them flexible but weak. However, it is currently unknown whether and how D2-receptor activation affects prefrontal representations in humans. In the current study, we use dopamine receptor-specific pharmacology and multivoxel pattern-based functional magnetic resonance imaging to test the hypothesis that blocking D2-receptor activation enhances prefrontal representations. Human subjects performed a simple reward prediction task after double-blind and placebo controlled administration of the D2-receptor antagonist amisulpride. Using a whole-brain searchlight decoding approach we show that D2-receptor blockade enhances decoding of reward signals in the medial orbitofrontal cortex. Examination of activity patterns suggests that amisulpride increases the separation of activity patterns related to reward versus no reward. Moreover, consistent with the cortical distribution of D2 receptors, post hoc analyses showed enhanced decoding of motor signals in motor cortex, but not of visual signals in visual cortex. These results suggest that D2-receptor blockade enhances content-specific representations in frontal cortex, presumably by a dopamine-mediated increase in pattern separation. These findings are in line with a dual-state model of prefrontal dopamine, and provide new insights into the potential mechanism of action of dopaminergic drugs.","[Kahnt, Thorsten] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Kahnt, Thorsten; Weber, Susanna C.; Tobler, Philippe N.] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Lab Social & Neural Syst Res, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Haker, Helene] Univ Zurich, Inst Biomed Engn, Translat Neuromodeling Unit, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Haker, Helene] ETH, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Robbins, Trevor W.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Psychol, Cambridge CB2 3EB, England; [Robbins, Trevor W.] Univ Cambridge, Behav & Clin Neurosci Inst, Cambridge CB2 3EB, England","Kahnt, T (reprint author), Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Dept Neurol, 303 East Chicago Ave,Ward 13-006, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.","thorsten.kahnt@northwestern.edu","","Tobler, Philippe/0000-0002-4915-9448; Robbins, Trevor/0000-0003-0642-5977; Kahnt, Thorsten/0000-0002-3575-2670","Swiss National Science Foundation [PP00P1_128574, PP00P1_150739, CRSII3_141965]; Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research in Affective Sciences; Medical Research Council; Wellcome Trust","This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grants PP00P1_128574, PP00P1_150739, and CRSII3_141965) and the Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research in Affective Sciences.

Here, we test whether empathy-an individual's relative ability to understand others' thoughts, emotions, and intentions-acts as an individual factor that alleviates conflict resolution in social decision-making. We test this by using a framed, iterated prisoners' dilemma (PD) game in two settings. In a behavioral experiment, we find that individual differences in empathic ability (the Empathy Quotient, EQ) were related to lower response times in the PD game, suggesting that empathy is related to faster social choices, independent of whether they choose to cooperate or defect. In a subsequent neuroimaging experiment, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we find that EQ is positively related to individual differences in the engagement of brain structures implemented in mentalizing, including the precuneus, superior temporal sulcus, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

Although music constitutes another powerful means to express emotions, the neural substrates involved in its processing remain poorly understood. In particular, it is unknown whether brain regions typically associated with processing 'biologically relevant' emotional expressions are also recruited by emotional music. To address this question, we conducted an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study in 47 healthy volunteers in which we directly compared responses to basic emotions (fear, sadness and happiness, as well as neutral) expressed through faces, non-linguistic vocalizations and short novel musical excerpts. Our results confirmed the importance of fear in emotional communication, as revealed by significant blood oxygen level-dependent signal increased in a cluster within the posterior amygdala and anterior hippocampus, as well as in the posterior insula across all three domains. Moreover, subject-specific amygdala responses to fearful music and vocalizations were correlated, consistent with the proposal that the brain circuitry involved in the processing of musical emotions might be shared with the one that have evolved for vocalizations. Overall, our results show that processing of fear expressed through music, engages some of the same brain areas known to be crucial for detecting and evaluating threat-related information.","[Aube, William; Peretz, Isabelle; Concha, Luis; Armony, Jorge L.] Int Lab Brain Mus & Sound Res BRAMS, Montreal, PQ H2V 4P3, Canada; [Aube, William; Peretz, Isabelle; Armony, Jorge L.] CRBLM, Montreal, PQ H3G 2A8, Canada; [Aube, William; Peretz, Isabelle] Univ Montreal, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ H2V 2S9, Canada; [Angulo-Perkins, Arafat; Concha, Luis] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Queretaro 76230, Mexico; [Armony, Jorge L.] McGill Univ, Dept Psychiat, Montreal, PQ H4H 1R3, Canada; [Armony, Jorge L.] McGill Univ, Douglas Mental Hlth Univ Inst, Montreal, PQ H4H 1R3, Canada","Aube, W (reprint author), Univ Montreal, BRAMS, Pavillon 1420,Blvd Mt Royal,CP 6128 Succ Ctr, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.","william.aube@umontreal.ca","","Concha, Luis/0000-0002-7842-3869","National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia de Mexico (CONACyT); Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM); NSERC; CONACyT-UNAM","This work was partly funded by grants from the National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) to J.L.A., and from Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia de Mexico (CONACyT) and Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM) to L.C.

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how individuals differently employ neural networks important for understanding others' beliefs and intentions (mentalizing), and for sensori-motor simulation while listening to excerpts from literary novels. Localizer tasks were used to localize both the cortical motor network and the mentalizing network in participants after they listened to excerpts from literary novels. Results show that participants who had high activation in anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC; part of the mentalizing network) when listening to mentalizing content of literary fiction, had lower motor cortex activity when they listened to action-related content of the story, and vice versa. This qualifies how people differ in their engagement with fiction: some people are mostly drawn into a story by mentalizing about the thoughts and beliefs of others, whereas others engage in literature by simulating more concrete events such as actions. This study provides on-line neural evidence for the existence of qualitatively different styles of moving into literary worlds, and adds to a growing body of literature showing the potential to study narrative comprehension with neuroimaging methods.","[Nijhof, Annabel D.; Willems, Roel M.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Willems, Roel M.] Max Planck Inst Psycholinguist, Nijmegen, Netherlands","Willems, RM (reprint author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands.","roel.willems@donders.ru.nl","","Nijhof, Annabel/0000-0002-4153-1284","Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour","The authors received funding from the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour for this work.

Recent neuroimaging studies have shown that several brain regions implicated in motivation and top-down control of attention also play a key role in stress induced choking, supporting for the over arousal and distraction theories of choking. This review aims to identify psychological factors that determine choking and the neural underpinnings of these processes.

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the neural basis of this process to understand the neural underpinnings of social decision making. Participants chose between selfish and generous alternatives, yielding either a large reward for the participant alone, or smaller rewards for the participant and another individual at a particular social distance. We found that generous choices engaged the temporoparietal junction (TPJ). In particular, the TPJ activity was scaled to the social-distance-dependent conflict between selfish and generous motives during prosocial choice, consistent with ideas that the TPJ promotes generosity by facilitating overcoming egoism bias. Based on functional coupling data, we propose and provide evidence for a biologically plausible neural model according to which the TPJ supports social discounting by modulating basic neural value signals in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex to incorporate social-distance-dependent other-regarding preferences into an otherwise exclusively own-reward value representation.","[Strombach, Tina; Hangebrauk, Zsofia; Kalenscher, Tobias] Univ Dusseldorf, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany; [Strombach, Tina; Weber, Bernd] Univ Hosp Bonn, Dept Epileptol, D-53105 Bonn, Germany; [Strombach, Tina; Weber, Bernd] Univ Bonn, Ctr Econ & Neurosci, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Kenning, Peter] Zeppelin Univ, Dept Corp Management & Econ, D-88045 Friedrichshafen, Germany; [Kenning, Peter] Univ Dusseldorf, Chair Mkt, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany; [Karipidis, Iliana I.; Tobler, Philippe N.] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Lab Social & Neural Syst Res, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland","Strombach, T (reprint author), Univ Dusseldorf, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.","tina.strombach@hhu.de","Weber, Bernd/H-5244-2012","Weber, Bernd/0000-0002-7811-9605; Tobler, Philippe/0000-0002-4915-9448","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [KA 2675/4, We 4427/3-1]; Swiss National Science Foundation (Schweizerische Nationalfonds) [PP00P1_128574, PP00P1_150739]","This work was supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) Grants KA 2675/4 (to T.K. and Z.H.) and We 4427/3-1 (to B.W.) and from the Swiss National Science Foundation (Schweizerische Nationalfonds) Grants PP00P1_128574 and PP00P1_150739 (to P.N.T.).","","40","46","46","0","32","NATL ACAD SCIENCES","WASHINGTON","2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA","0027-8424","","","P NATL ACAD SCI USA","Proc.

Based on the role of the ventral striatum (VS) in responding to: (1) the anticipation of and motivation to approach rewarding outcomes and (2) viewing social support figures, the VS may also be involved in sickness-induced approach toward support figures. Thus, the goal of the present study was to examine whether inflammation leads to a greater desire to approach support figures and greater VS activity to viewing support figures. To examine this, 63 participants received either placebo or low-dose endotoxin, which safely triggers an inflammatory response. Participants reported how much they desired to be around a self-identified support figure, and viewed pictures of that support figure while undergoing an fMRI scan to assess reward-related neural activity. In line with hypotheses, endotoxin (vs. placebo) led participants to report a greater desire to be around their support figure. In addition, endotoxin (vs. placebo) led to greater VS activity to images of support figures (vs. strangers), and greater increases in inflammation (IL-6 levels) were associated with greater increases in VS activity. Together, these results reveal a possible neural mechanism important for sickness-induced social approach and highlight the need for a more nuanced view of changes in social behavior during sickness.

While prior work has made great strides in characterizing reappraisal's neural mechanisms and behavioral outcomes, the key issue of how regulation varies as a function of emotional intensity remains unaddressed. We compared the behavioral and neural correlates of reappraisal of high- and low-intensity emotional responses using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We found that successful reappraisal of both high- and low-intensity emotions depends upon recruitment of dorsomedial (dmPFC) as well as left dorsolateral (dlPFC) and ventrolateral (vlPFC) prefrontal cortex. However, reappraisal of high-intensity emotions more strongly activated left dlPFC, and in addition, activated right lateral and dorsomedial PFC regions not recruited by low-intensity reappraisal. No brain regions were more strongly recruited during reappraisal of low when compared with high-intensity emotions. Taken together, these results suggest that reappraisal of high-intensity emotion requires greater cognitive resources as evidenced by quantitative and qualitative differences in prefrontal recruitment. These data have implications for understanding how and when specific PFC systems are needed to regulate different types of emotional responses.","[Silvers, Jennifer A.; Weber, Jochen; Ochsner, Kevin N.] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Wager, Tor D.] Univ Colorado, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Ochsner, KN (reprint author), Columbia Univ, Dept Psychol, 406 Schermerhorn Hall,1190 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10027 USA.","ochsner@psych.columbia.edu","","","National Institutes of Health [MH094056, R01 MH076137]; National Science Foundation [0631637]","This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (grant number MH094056 awarded to JAS; R01 MH076137 awarded to KNO and TDW) and the National Science Foundation (grant number 0631637 awarded to KNO)","","53","13","13","2","26","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

We acquired fMRI data while participants watched positive or negative movie-clips and subsequently performed an unrelated task with fearful and neutral faces. We quantified changes in amygdala reactivity to fearful faces as a function of the valence of preceding movies and cumulative neural activity evoked during them. We demonstrate that amygdala responses to emotional movies spill over to subsequent processing of threat information in a valence-specific manner: negative movies enhance later amygdala activation whereas positive movies attenuate it. Critically, the magnitude of such changes is predicted by a measure of cumulative amygdala responses to the preceding positive or negative movies. These effects appear independent of overt attention, are regionally limited to amygdala, with no changes in functional connectivity. Finally, individuals with higher state anxiety displayed stronger modulation of amygdala reactivity by positive movies. These results suggest that intensity and valence of emotional events as well as anxiety levels promote local changes in amygdala sensitivity to threat, highlighting the importance of past experience in shaping future affective reactivity.","[Pichon, Swann; Miendlarzewska, Ewa A.; Eryilmaz, Hamdi; Vuilleumier, Patrik] Univ Geneva, Lab Behav Neurol & Imaging Cognit, Dept Neurosci, Sch Med, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Pichon, Swann; Miendlarzewska, Ewa A.; Eryilmaz, Hamdi; Vuilleumier, Patrik] Univ Geneva, Swiss Ctr Affect Sci, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Pichon, Swann] Univ Geneva, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland; [Eryilmaz, Hamdi] Harvard Univ, Ctr Brain Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Pichon, S (reprint author), Univ Geneva, FPSE, Unimail, 40 Bd Pont Arve, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland.","swann.pichon@gmail.com","Miendlarzewska, Ewa/D-9216-2017; pichon, swann/M-2966-2014","pichon, swann/0000-0001-5697-702X","National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) Affective Sciences - Swiss National Science Foundation [51NF40-104897]; Academic Society of Geneva","Authors would like to thank Ben Meuleman and Dimitri Van De Ville for helpful discussions regarding data analyses, as well as Daphne Bavelier for helpful comments on earlier versions of the manuscript.

Participants were scanned (fMRI) while taking part in triadic communication involving two recipients and a speaker. The speaker uttered sentences that were and were not accompanied by complementary iconic gestures. Crucially, the speaker alternated her gaze direction, thus creating two recipient roles: addressed (direct gaze) vs unaddressed (averted gaze) recipient. The comprehension of Speech&Gesture relative to SpeechOnly utterances recruited middle occipital, middle temporal and inferior frontal gyri, bilaterally. The calcarine sulcus and posterior cingulate cortex were sensitive to differences between direct and averted gaze.

The cognitive dimension is characterized by difficulties in identifying, verbalizing and analysing feelings. The affective dimension comprises reduced levels of emotional experience and imagination. Alexithymia is widely regarded to arise from an impairment of emotion regulation. This is the first functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study to critically evaluate this by investigating the neural correlates of emotion regulation as a function of alexithymia levels. The aim of the current study was to investigate the neural correlates underlying the two alexithymia dimensions during emotion perception and emotion regulation. Using fMRI, we scanned 51 healthy subjects while viewing, reappraising or suppressing negative emotional pictures. The results support the idea that cognitive alexithymia, but not affective alexithymia, is associated with lower activation in emotional attention and recognition networks during emotion perception. However, in contrast with several theories, no alexithymia-related differences were found during emotion regulation (neither reappraisal nor suppression). These findings suggest that alexithymia may result from an early emotion processing deficit rather than compromised frontal circuits subserving higher-order emotion regulation processes.","[van der Velde, Jorien; Aleman, Andre] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Neuroimaging Ctr, NL-9713 AW Groningen, Netherlands; [Gromann, Paula M.; Krabbendam, Lydia] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Educ Neurosci, Fac Psychol & Educ, NL-1081 BT Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Swart, Marte] Lentis, Ctr Mental Healthcare, NL-9725 AG Groningen, Netherlands; [Wiersma, Durk; Bruggeman, Richard] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Psychiat, NL-9713 GZ Groningen, Netherlands; [Wiersma, Durk; Bruggeman, Richard] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Rob Giel Res Ctr, NL-9713 GZ Groningen, Netherlands; [de Haan, Lieuwe] Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr Amsterdam, Dept Psychiat, NL-1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Aleman, Andre] Univ Groningen, Dept Expt Psychol, NL-9712 TS Groningen, Netherlands","van der Velde, J (reprint author), UMCG O&O, Dept Neurosci, Neuroimaging Ctr, POB 196, NL-9700 AD Groningen, Netherlands.","jorien.van.der.velde@umcg.nl","Krabbendam, Lydia/F-9163-2010","Krabbendam, Lydia/0000-0003-4074-5149; Bruggeman, Richard/0000-0002-3238-8471","ZonMw, within the Mental Health programma [10.000.1002]; VICI grant from N.W.O.

Recent evidence has indicated that the ventral frontoparietal attention network is primarily engaged by breaches of a viewer's cue-related expectations. Accordingly, we hypothesized that to the extent that non-predictive gaze and arrow cues automatically engender expectations with regard to cue location, they should activate the ventral attention network when they cue attention invalidly. Using event-related fMRI, we found that invalid gaze but not arrow cues activated the ventral attention network, specifically in the area of the right temporal parietal junction (TPJ), as well as nodes along the dorsal attention network associated with a redirection of attention to the correct target location. In additional whole-brain analyses, facilitation of behavioral response time by valid gaze cues was linearly associated with the degree of activation in the right TPJ.

This study is based on genotype-dependent reanalysis of data from our previous publication (Li et al. Brain Imaging Behav 2014). Twenty-two healthy male volunteers were genotyped for the ADRA2B gene encoding the alpha 2B-adrenergic receptor. Ten deletion carriers and 12 noncarriers performed an emotional face recognition task, while their brain activity was measured with fMRI. During encoding, 50 fearful and 50 neutral faces were presented. One hour later, they underwent either an acute stress (Trier Social Stress Test) or a control procedure which was followed immediately by the retrieval session, where participants had to discriminate between 100 old and 50 new faces. A genotype-dependent modulation of neural activity at retrieval was found in the bilateral amygdala and right hippocampus. Deletion carriers showed decreased neural activity in the amygdala when recognizing emotional faces in control condition and increased amygdala activity under stress. Noncarriers showed no differences in emotional modulated amygdala activation under stress or control. Instead, stress-induced increases during recognition of emotional faces were present in the right hippocampus. The genotype-dependent effects of acute stress on neural activity in amygdala and hippocampus provide evidence for noradrenergic-glucocorticoid interaction in emotional memory retrieval.","[Li, Shijia; Weerda, Riklef; Milde, Christopher; Thiel, Christiane M.] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, European Med Sch, Dept Psychol, Biol Psychol Lab, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Thiel, Christiane M.] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Res Ctr Neurosensory Sci, Excellence Cluster Hearing4all, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Wolf, Oliver T.] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Cognit Neurosci, D-44780 Bochum, Germany; [Li, Shijia] Ctr Behav Brain Sci, Clin Affect Neuroimaging Lab CANLAB, D-39120 Magdeburg, Germany; [Milde, Christopher] Heidelberg Univ, Med Fac Mannheim, Dept Cognit & Clin Psychol, Cent Inst Mental Hlth, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany","Li, SJ (reprint author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, European Med Sch, Dept Psychol, Biol Psychol Lab, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany.","shijia@canlab.de","Li, Shijia/C-8821-2015","Li, Shijia/0000-0002-8813-7815; Wolf, Oliver T./0000-0002-9320-2124","China Scholarship Council (CSC)","Shijia Li was supported by a scholarship from China Scholarship Council (CSC).

Meta-analytic coactivation studies have uncovered networks similar to resting ICNs, suggesting that in task states connectivity modulations may occur principally within ICNs. However, it has also been suggested that specific hub regions dynamically link networks under different task conditions. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging at rest and a continuous visual attention task in 16 participants to investigate whether a shift from rest to attention was reflected by within-network connectivity modulation, or changes in network topography. Our analyses revealed evidence for both modulation of connectivity within the default-mode (DMN) and dorsal attention networks (DAN) between conditions, and identified a set of regions including the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and posterior middle frontal gyrus (MFG) that switched between the DMN and DAN depending on the task. We further investigated the temporal nonstationarity of flexible (TPJ and MFG) regions during both attention and rest. This showed that moment-to-moment differences in connectivity at rest mirrored the variation in connectivity between tasks. Task-dependent changes in functional connectivity of flexible regions may, therefore, be understood as shifts in the proportion of time specific connections are engaged, rather than a switch between networks per se. This ability of specific regions to dynamically link ICNs under different task conditions may play an important role in behavioral flexibility. Hum Brain Mapp 36:549-565, 2015.

Although recent neuroscience studies have used the ultimatum game to understand the neuropsychological mechanisms that underlie the enforcement of fairness norms; however, a precise characterization of the neural systems underlying fairness-related norm enforcement remains elusive. In this study, we used a coordinate-based meta-analysis on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies using the ultimatum game with the goal to provide an additional level of evidence for the refinement of the underlying neural architecture of this human puzzling behavior. Our results demonstrated a convergence of reported activation foci in brain networks associated with psychological components of fairness-related normative decision making, presumably reflecting a reflexive and intuitive system (System 1) and a reflective and deliberate system (System 2). System 1 (anterior insula, ventromedial prefrontal cortex [PFC]) may be associated with the reflexive and intuitive responses to norm violations, representing a motivation to punish norm violators. Those intuitive responses conflict with economic self-interest, encoded in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which may engage cognitive control from a reflective and deliberate System 2 to resolve the conflict by either suppressing (ventrolateral PFC, dorsomedial PFC, left dorsolateral PFC, and rostral ACC) the intuitive responses or over-riding self-interest (right dorsolateral PFC). Taken together, we suggest that fairness-related norm enforcement recruits an intuitive system for rapid evaluation of norm violations and a deliberate system for integrating both social norms and self-interest to regulate the intuitive system in favor of more flexible decision making.

The functional connectivity network related to lie-telling remains largely uncharacterized. Methods: In this study, we designed a lie-telling experiment that emphasized strategy devising. Thirty-two subjects underwent fMRI while responding to questions in a truthful, inverse, or deceitful manner. For each subject, whole-brain functional connectivity networks were constructed from correlations among brain regions for the lie-telling and truth-telling conditions. Then, a multivariate pattern analysis approach was used to distinguish lie-telling from truth-telling based on the functional connectivity networks. Results: The classification results demonstrated that lie-telling could be differentiated from truth-telling with an accuracy of 82.81% (85.94% for lie-telling, 79.69% for truth-telling). The connectivities related to the fronto-parietal networks, cerebellum and cingulo-opercular networks are most discriminating, implying crucial roles for these three networks in the processing of deception. Conclusions: The current study may shed new light on the neural pattern of deception from a functional integration viewpoint.","[Jiang, Weixiong; Liu, Huasheng; Liao, Jian; Wang, Wei] Cent S Univ, Xiangya Hosp 3, Dept Radiol, Changsha 410013, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Weixiong; Zeng, Lingli; Shen, Hui; Hu, Dewen] Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Mechatron & Automat, Changsha 410073, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Weixiong] Hunan First Normal Univ, Dept Informat Sci & Engn, Changsha 410205, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Luo, Aijing; Wang, Wei] Cent S Univ, Coll Hunan Prov, Key Lab Med Informat Res, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China","Hu, DW (reprint author), Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Mechatron & Automat, Changsha 410073, Hunan, Peoples R China.","dwhu@nudt.edu.cn; cjr.wangwei@vip.163.com","Hu, Dewen/D-1978-2015","Hu, Dewen/0000-0001-7357-0053; Zeng, Ling-Li/0000-0002-0515-256X","Funding Project of Education Ministry for the Development of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences [13YJCZH068]; National Science Foundation of China [61420106001, 61375111]; Research Foundation of Education Bureau of Hunan Province [13B013]; Hunan Province Education Science Planning Project [XJK013AXX001]","We thank the volunteers for their participation in the study and the anonymous referees for their insightful comments and suggestions.

Sensing active listening in social interactions is accompanied by an improvement in the recollected impressions of relevant experiences and is thought to arouse positive feelings. We therefore hypothesized that the recognition of active listening activates the reward system, and that the emotional appraisal of experiences that had been subject to active listening would be improved. To test these hypotheses, we conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on participants viewing assessments of their own personal experiences made by evaluators with or without active listening attitude. Subjects rated evaluators who showed active listening more positively. Furthermore, they rated episodes more positively when they were evaluated by individuals showing active listening. Neural activation in the ventral striatum was enhanced by perceiving active listening, suggesting that this was processed as rewarding. It also activated the right anterior insula, representing positive emotional reappraisal processes. Furthermore, the mentalizing network was activated when participants were being evaluated, irrespective of active listening behavior. Therefore, perceiving active listening appeared to result in positive emotional appraisal and to invoke mental state attribution to the active listener.","[Kawamichi, Hiroaki; Sasaki, Akihiro T.; Sugawara, Sho K.; Tanabe, Hiroki C.; Sadato, Norihiro] Natl Inst Nat Sci, Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Dept Cerebral Res, Div Cerebral Integrat, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan; [Yoshihara, Kazufumi] Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci, Dept Psychosomat Med, Fukuoka 8128582, Japan; [Tanabe, Hiroki C.] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Dept Social & Human Environm, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Shinohara, Ryoji; Sugisawa, Yuka; Tokutake, Kentaro; Mochizuki, Yukiko; Anme, Tokie] Univ Tsukuba, Grad Sch Comprehens Human Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058575, Japan","Kawamichi, H (reprint author), 38 Nishigo Naka, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan.","kawami@nips.ac.jp","U-ID, Kyushu/C-5291-2016; Sasaki, Akihiro/C-3658-2017","Sasaki, Akihiro/0000-0002-2249-4975; Kawamichi, Hiroaki/0000-0002-6172-8906","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan (MEXT) [23101507, 22101007]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [21220005, 23700505, 25750407]; MEXT","This study was partly supported by Scientific Research on Innovative Areas grants [#23101507] (to H.K.) and [#22101007] (to H.C.T.) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan (MEXT), by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (S) [#21220005] (to N.S.) and by Grants-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) [#23700505] and [#25750407] (to H.K.) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.

Here I argue that music is, by definition, sound that we believe has been in some way organized by a human agent, meaning that listening to any musical sounds can be a social experience. There are a number of distinct mechanisms by which we might associate musical sound with agency. While some of these mechanisms involve learning motor associations with that sound, it is also possible to have a more direct relationship from musical sound to agency, and the relative importance of these potentially independent mechanisms should be further explored. Overall, I conclude that the apparent paradox of solipsistic musical engagement is in fact unproblematic, because the way that we perceive and experience musical sounds is inherently social.","[Launay, Jacques] Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, Oxford OX1 2JD, England","Launay, J (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.","","","Launay, Jacques/0000-0002-4266-6834","European Research Council [295663]","","","61","6","6","0","3","OHIO STATE UNIV, SCH MUSIC","COLUMBUS","1866 COLLEGE RD, 110 WEIGEL HALL, COLUMBUS, OH 43210 USA","1559-5749","","","EMPIR MUSICOL REV","Empir.

Although general familiarity and liking are related, it is less clear how motor familiarity, or embodiment, relates to a viewer's aesthetic appraisal. This study directly compared how learning to embody an action impacts the neural response when watching and aesthetically evaluating the same action. Twenty-two participants trained for 4 days on dance sequences. Each day they physically rehearsed one set of sequences, passively watched a second set, listened to the music of a third set, and a fourth set remained untrained. Functional MRI was obtained prior to and immediately following the training period, as were affective and physical ability ratings for each dance sequence. This approach enabled precise comparison of self-report methods of embodiment with nonbiased, empirical measures of action performance. Results suggest that after experience, participants most enjoy watching those dance sequences they danced or observed. Moreover, brain regions involved in mediating the aesthetic response shift from subcortical regions associated with dopaminergic reward processing to posterior temporal regions involved in processing multisensory integration, emotion, and biological motion.","[Kirsch, Louise P.; Dawson, Kelvin; Cross, Emily S.] Bangor Univ, Wales Inst Cognit Neurosci, Sch Psychol, Bangor LL57 2AS, Gwynedd, Wales; [Cross, Emily S.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Social & Cultural Psychol, Inst Behav Sci, Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands","Cross, ES (reprint author), Bangor Univ, Wales Inst Cognit Neurosci, Sch Psychol, Bangor LL57 2AS, Gwynedd, Wales.","e.cross@bangor.ac.uk","","Kirsch, Louise/0000-0002-8418-776X; Cross, Emily S./0000-0002-1671-5698","Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K0001892/1]; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research [451-11-002]; Marie Curie Career Integration Grant [PCIG11-GA-2012-322256]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K001892/1]","The authors thank Danielle Owen, Abbie Morgan, and Rhiannon Edwards for assistance with data collection, Guillaume Thierry for use of his flat-screen television for training purposes, Julie Grezes for discussions about analyses, and Emily Butler for constructive feedback on an earlier version of this manuscript.

Converging neuropsychological and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) evidence suggests that this may reflect inhibition of self-perspective. The present study adapted an extensively published ToM localizer to evaluate the role of vlPFC in inhibition of self-perspective. The classic false belief, false photograph vignettes that comprise the localizer were modified to generate high and low salience of self-perspective. Using a factorial design, the present study identified a behavioural and neural cost associated with having a highly salient self-perspective that was incongruent with the representational content. Importantly, vlPFC only differentiated between high versus low salience of self-perspective when representing mental state content. No difference was identified for non-mental representation. This result suggests that different control processes are required to represent competing mental and non-mental content. (c) 2014 The Authors.

Previous studies regarding one's first language (L1) have treated the theory of mind system, which is associated with understanding others, and the sensorimotor system, which is associated with action simulation, as important contributors to communication. However, little is known about the neural basis of communication in a second language (L2), which is limited in terms of its use as a communication tool. In this fMRI study, we manipulated the type of speech (i.e., communication vs. description) and the type of language (L1 vs. L2) to identify the specific brain areas involved in L2 communication. We also attempted to examine how the cortical mechanisms underlying L2 speech production are influenced by oral proficiency and anxiety regarding L2. Thirty native Japanese speakers who had learned English as an 12, performed communicative and descriptive speech-production tasks in both L1 and L2 while undergoing fMRI scanning. We found that the only the L2 communication task recruited the left posterior supramarginal gyrus (pSMG), which may be associated with the action simulation or prediction involved in generating goal-directed actions. Furthermore, the neural mechanisms underlying L2 communication, but not L2 description, were sensitive to both oral proficiency and anxiety levels; (a) activation in the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) increased as oral proficiency levels increased, and (b) activation in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), including the left insula, decreased as L2 anxiety levels increased. These results reflect the successful retrieval of lexical information in a pragmatic context and an inability to monitor social behaviors due to anxiety. Taken together, the present results suggest that L2 communication relies on social skills and is mediated by anxiety and oral proficiency.

The current investigation filled this gap by assigning participants to consume the physical painkiller acetaminophen or placebo and then exposing them to situations known to produce cognitive dissonance (Experiment 1) or loss aversion (Experiment 2).

These signals are typically conveyed multi-modally by the face and voice. Previous research has demonstrated uni-modal contrastive aftereffects for emotionally expressive faces or voices. Here we were interested in whether these aftereffects transfer across modality as theoretical models predict. We show that adaptation to facial expressions elicits significant auditory aftereffects. Adaptation to angry facial expressions caused ambiguous vocal stimuli drawn from an anger-fear morphed continuum to be perceived as less angry and more fearful relative to adaptation to fearful faces. In a second experiment, we demonstrate that these aftereffects are not dependent on learned face-voice congruence, i.e. adaptation to one facial identity transferred to an unmatched voice identity. Taken together, our findings provide support for a supra-modal representation of emotion and suggest further that identity and emotion may be processed independently from one another, at least at the supra-modal level of the processing hierarchy.

Two domains in which this ability is particularly salient are the processing of social and valence information and are supported by common cortical areas in the medial pFC (MPFC). Because social information is often embedded within valenced emotional contexts, it is possible that activation patterns within the MPFC may represent both of these types of cognitive processes when presented simultaneously. The current study tested this possibility by employing a large-scale automated meta-analysis tool, together with multivoxel pattern analysis to investigate the representational similarity of social and valence information in the MPFC during fMRI. Using a representational similarity analysis, we found a high degree of representational similarity both within social dimensions and within valence dimensions, but not across them (e.g., positive social information was highly dissimilar to negative non-social information), in a ventral portion of the MPFC. These results were significantly correlated with a behaviorally measured similarity structure of the same stimuli, suggesting that a psychologically meaningful representation of social and valence information is reflected by multivoxel activation patterns in the ventral MPFC.","[Chavez, Robert S.; Heatherton, Todd F.] Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA","Chavez, RS (reprint author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Moore Hall 6207, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.","robert.s.chavez.GR@dartmouth.edu","","Chavez, Robert/0000-0001-7877-299X","National Institutes of Health [MH059282]","The authors thank Courtney Rogers for help with data collection and Dylan Wagner for help with the analysis.

For example, automobile crashes are the leading cause of death for adolescents, and driving with peers increases the risk of a fatal crash. Growing evidence points to an interaction between neural systems implicated in cognitive control and social and emotional context in predicting adolescent risk. We tested such a relationship in recently licensed teen drivers. Participants completed an fMRI session in which neural activity was measured during a response inhibition task, followed by a separate driving simulator session 1 week later. Participants drove alone and with a peer who was randomly assigned to express risk-promoting or risk-averse social norms. The experimentally manipulated social context during the simulated drive moderated the relationship between individual differences in neural activity in the hypothesized cognitive control network (right inferior frontal gyrus, BG) and risk-taking in the driving context a week later. Increased activity in the response inhibition network was not associated with risk-taking in the presence of a risky peer but was significantly predictive of safer driving in the presence of a cautious peer, above and beyond self-reported susceptibility to peer pressure. Individual differences in recruitment of the response inhibition network may allow those with stronger inhibitory control to override risky tendencies when in the presence of cautious peers. This relationship between social context and individual differences in brain function expands our understanding of neural systems involved in top-down cognitive control during adolescent development.","[Cascio, Christopher N.; O'Donnell, Matthew Brook; Falk, Emily B.] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Carp, Joshua; Tinney, Francis J., Jr.; Bingham, C.

In this fMRI study, we compared the processing of behaviors performed by a member of a social category versus an individual, both possessing similar personality traits. Based on previous behavioral studies we predicted that the processing of social category-related information would recruit more activation in brain areas related to mentalizing than individual trait-related information. Participants read sentences describing behaviors performed by a member of a social category (of which the stereotype involves a given trait) or by an individual possessing the same trait. These behavioral sentences varied on both valence (positive versus negative) and consistency (consistent versus inconsistent) with regard to the social category or trait. The results revealed that social category-related behavioral information showed more activation in mentalizing areas (medial prefrontal cortex, anterior temporal lobe, bilateral temporo-parietal junction, posterior cingulate cortex) than trait-related information. This increased activation is interpreted in terms of the impact of autobiographical memories, greater variance among members of social categories than individual traits, a higher construal level (i.e., abstractness), and larger perceived group size. Additionally, inconsistent as opposed to consistent information showed more activation in the right temporo-parietal junction and left lingual gyrus. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Regardless of the precise thresholding procedure, these approaches ultimately divide the brain in regions that do or do not differ significantly across experimental conditions. This binary classification scheme fosters the so-called imager's fallacy, where researchers prematurely conclude that region A is selectively involved in a certain cognitive task because activity in that region reaches statistical significance and activity in region B does not. For such a conclusion to be statistically valid, however, a test on the differences in activation across these two regions is required. Here we propose a simple GLM-based method that defines an ""in-between"" category of brain regions that are neither significantly active nor inactive, but rather ""in limbo"". For regions that are in limbo, the activation pattern is inconclusive: it does not differ significantly from baseline, but neither does it differ significantly from regions that do show significant changes from baseline. This pattern indicates that measurement was insufficiently precise. By directly testing differences in activation, our procedure helps reduce the impact of the imager's fallacy.

A hub is a highly connected node with high centrality. It has been shown that both ""communities"" and ""hubs"" exist simultaneously in the brain's functional connectivity network (FCN), as estimated by correlations among low-frequency spontaneous fluctuations in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal changes (0.01-0.10 Hz). This indicates that the brain has a spatial organization that promotes both segregation and integration of information. Here, we demonstrate that frequency-specific network topologies that characterize segregation and integration also exist within this frequency range. In investigating the coherence spectrum among 87 brain regions, we found that two frequency bands, 0.01-0.03 Hz (very low frequency [VLF] band) and 0.07-0.09 Hz (low frequency [LF] band), mainly contributed to functional connectivity. Comparing graph theoretical indices for the VLF and LF bands revealed that the network in the former had a higher capacity for information segregation between identified communities than the latter. Hubs in the VLF band were mainly located within the anterior cingulate cortices, whereas those in the LF band were located in the posterior cingulate cortices and thalamus. Thus, depending on the timescale of brain activity, at least two distinct network topologies contributed to information segregation and integration. This suggests that the brain intrinsically has timescale-dependent functional organizations.","[Sasai, Shuntaro; Watanabe, Hama; Taga, Gentaro] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Educ, Tokyo, Japan; [Sasai, Shuntaro] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychiat, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Homae, Fumitaka] Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Dept Language Sci, Tokyo 158, Japan; [Sasaki, Akihiro T.] RIKEN, Ctr Life Sci Technol, Div Funct Dynam Imaging, Pathophysiol & Hlth Sci Team,Imaging Applicat Grp, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan; [Sasaki, Akihiro T.] Osaka City Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Physiol, Osaka 558, Japan; [Tanabe, Hiroki C.] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Sadato, Norihiro] Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Dept Ceberal Res, Div Cerebral Integrat, Okazaki, Aichi, Japan; [Sadato, Norihiro] Grad Univ Adv Studies, SOKENDAI, Dept Physiol Sci, Okazaki, Aichi, Japan","Sasai, S (reprint author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychiat, 6001 Res Pk, Madison, WI 53719 USA.","sasai@p.u-tokyo.ac.jp","Sasaki, Akihiro/C-3658-2017","Sasaki, Akihiro/0000-0002-2249-4975; Sasai, Shuntaro/0000-0002-9941-6510","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology in Japan (MEXT) [21220005];  [2311065];  [2067001];  [23650224];  [22101007]","We thank Kayo Asakawa for providing administrative assistance.

Seventeen older adults received a six-week intervention that consisted of cognitive training, Tai Chi exercise, and group counseling, while 17 older adults in a control group attended health knowledge lectures. The intervention group demonstrated enhanced memory and social support compared to the control group. The amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) in the middle frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, and anterior cerebellum lobe was enhanced for the intervention group, while the control group showed reduced ALFF in these three regions. Moreover, changes in trail-making performance and well-being could be predicted by the intervention-induced changes in ALFF. Additionally, individual differences in the baseline ALFF were correlated with intervention-related changes in behavioral performance. These findings suggest that a multimodal intervention is effective in improving cognitive functions and well-being and can induce functional changes in the aging brain. The study extended previous training studies by suggesting resting-state ALFF as a marker of intervention-induced plasticity in older adults.","[Yin, Shufei; Zhu, Xinyi; Li, Rui; Niu, Yanan; Wang, Baoxi; Zheng, Zhiwei; Huang, Xin; Huo, Lijuan; Li, Juan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Psychol, Ctr Aging Psychol, Key Lab Mental Hlth, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yin, Shufei; Wang, Baoxi; Zheng, Zhiwei; Huang, Xin; Huo, Lijuan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Rui; Li, Juan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Psychol, Magnet Resonance Imaging Res Ctr, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Li, J (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Psychol, Ctr Aging Psychol, Key Lab Mental Hlth, Beijing, Peoples R China.","lijuan@psych.ac.cn","Yin, Shufei/L-2824-2015; Zhu, Xinyi/H-5933-2015","Yin, Shufei/0000-0001-7218-859X; Zhu, Xinyi/0000-0002-7361-8958; li, rui/0000-0002-4101-5415","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31470998, 31271108, 31200847, 31070916]; Knowledge Innovation Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [KSCX2-EW-J-8]; CAS/SAFEA International Partnership Program for Creative Research Team [Y2CX131003]; Scientific Foundation of Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences [Y1CX251005, 111000C038]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31470998, 31271108, 31200847 and 31070916), Knowledge Innovation Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (KSCX2-EW-J-8), CAS/SAFEA International Partnership Program for Creative Research Team (Y2CX131003), and Scientific Foundation of Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Y1CX251005, 111000C038).","","61","19","22","5","33","NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP","LONDON","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","2045-2322","","","SCI REP-UK","Sci Rep","DEC 4","2014","4","","","","","","","","7309","10.1038/srep07309","","","","9","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science & Technology - Other Topics","AW4RG","WOS:000346267700003","25472002","DOAJ Gold, Green Published","","","2019-02-21","searchterm","searchterm_records_2501-3000.txt"

Much research has shown how native language affects the cognitive and neural mechanisms of a new language, but little is known about whether and how learning a new language shapes the neural mechanisms of prior language(s). In two experiments in the current study, we used an artificial language training paradigm in combination with an fMRI to examine (1) the effects of different linguistic components (phonology and semantics) of a new language on the neural process of prior languages (i.e., native and second languages), and (2) whether such effects were modulated by the proficiency level in the new language. Results of Experiment 1 showed that when the training in a new language involved semantics (as opposed to only visual forms and phonology), neural activity during word reading in the native language (Chinese) was reduced in several reading-related regions, including the left pars opercularis, pars triangularis, bilateral inferior temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and inferior occipital gyrus. Results of Experiment 2 replicated the results of Experiment 1 and further found that semantic training also affected neural activity during word reading in the subjects' second language (English). Furthermore, we found that the effects of the new language were modulated by the subjects' proficiency level in the new language. These results provide critical imaging evidence for the influence of learning to read words in a new language on word reading in native and second languages. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

While agreeing that neuroscientific research into the risks of maltreatment is a very valuable and exciting area of study, this article challenges the confidence with which these findings are used in policy discussions. It critically discusses the reliability and validity of the relevant findings and the contribution they can currently make to our understanding of the causes and consequences of maltreatment. In addition, it is argued that this type of evidence, which is new in policy debates, is often being used in ways that are problematic. Many participants in the relevant policy debates seem to subscribe either to an implicit version of dualism about the relationship between the mind and the body, or to reductionism - the view that the mental can be reduced to the physical. Such assumptions threaten the way we think about human agency and moral responsibility but it is argued that they are misguided for conceptual reasons. It is concluded that neuroscience has the potential to contribute to our understanding of the causes and effects of maltreatment but cannot do so in isolation from the social sciences.

However, the neural mechanisms of these initiating and modulating functions are unclear. In this study, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and task-based fMRI to explore these processes by examining spontaneous cerebral activities and brain activations under two conditions: holding a pen using only the teeth (HPT: facilitating the muscles typically associated with smiling) and holding a pen using only the lips (HPL: inhibiting the muscles typically associated with smiling). The resting-state fMRI results showed that compared with the HPL condition, significant increases in the amplitudes of low-frequency fluctuations were found in the right posterior cingulate gyrus [PCG; Brodmann area 31 (BA31)] and in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG; BA9) in the HPT condition. These findings might be related to the initiation of positive emotions (PCG) and to the control and allocation of attention (MFG). The task-based fMRI results showed that the inferior parietal lobule, left supplementary motor area, superior parietal lobule, precuneus, and bilateral middle cingulum were active when facial manipulation influenced the recognition of emotional facial expressions. These results demonstrate that facial actions might not only initiate a particular emotion and draw attention, but also influence face-based emotion recognition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To investigate whether the ancient mammalian neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) influences self-referential processing in the domains of emotion evaluation and moral decision making, we conducted a pharmaco-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a behavioral experiment involving 157 healthy women and men who were treated with either OXT (24 IU) or placebo (PLC) intranasally. Our results show that OXT facilitated cortical midline responses during self-processing of disgust and selectively promoted self-interest moral judgments in men. In contrast, in women OXT increased the reaction time difference between accepted and rejected moral dilemmas and led them to suppress their self-interest and respond more altruistically for the benefit of others. Taken together, these findings suggest an OXT-related sexual dimorphism in human moral behavior which evolved adaptively to optimize both protection and nurturing of offspring by promoting selfish behavior in men and altruistic behavior in women.

The current research is the first to explore if the endowment effect could be extended to different ownerships. The results suggest that the endowment effect extends to goods owned by their mothers, romantic partners and close friends, but not acquaintances. Furthermore, the level of intimacy between individuals and mothers/romantic partners/close friends/acquaintances mediates the relationship between the effect of ownership and the extensibility of the endowment effect.

Here we implement novel intersubject phase synchronization andwhole-brain dynamic connectivity measures to show that networks of brain areas become synchronized across participants who are listening to emotional episodes in spoken narratives. Twenty participants' hemodynamic brain activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while they listened to 45-s narratives describing unpleasant, neutral, and pleasant events spoken in neutral voice. After scanning, participants listened to the narratives again and rated continuously their feelings of pleasantness-unpleasantness (valence) and of arousal-calmness. Instantaneous intersubject phase synchronization (ISPS) measures were computed to derive both multi-subject voxel-wise similarity measures of hemodynamic activity and inter-area functional dynamic connectivity (seed-based phase synchronization, SBPS). Valence and arousal time series were subsequently used to predict the ISPS and SBPS time series. High arousal was associated with increased ISPS in the auditory cortices and in Broca's area, and negative valence was associated with enhanced ISPS in the thalamus, anterior cingulate, lateral prefrontal, and orbitofrontal cortices. Negative valence affected functional connectivity of fronto-parietal, limbic (insula, cingulum) and fronto-opercular circuitries, and positive arousal affected the connectivity of the striatum, amygdala, thalamus, cerebellum, and dorsal frontal cortex. Positive valence and negative arousal had markedly smaller effects. We propose that high arousal synchronizes the listeners' sound-processing and speech-comprehension networks, whereas negative valence synchronizes circuitries supporting emotional and self-referential processing.

While economic theory prescribes performance-based incentives to align goals and induce effort, psychology theory suggests that the salience of emotions is difficult to overcome without also inducing more deliberate consideration of both emotional and economic factors (""System 2 processing""). We link these perspectives by investigating whether performance-based incentives mitigate the costly influence of emotion by inducing more System 2 processing. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and traditional experiments, we investigate managers' brain activity and choices under fixed wage and performance-based contracts.

Building on the assumption that similarities between the different 'modes' of voice cues may not only be limited to their functional role but may also include cerebral mechanisms engaged in the decoding process, the present functional magnetic resonance imaging study aimed at exploring brain responses associated with processing emotional voice signals described in literary texts. Emphasis was placed on evaluating 'voice' sensitive as well as task- and emotion-related modulations of brain activation frequently associated with the decoding of acoustic vocal cues. Obtained findings suggest that several similarities emerge with respect to the perception of acoustic voice signals: results identify the superior temporal, lateral and medial frontal cortex as well as the posterior cingulate cortex and cerebellum to contribute to the decoding process, with similarities to acoustic voice perception reflected in a 'voice'-cue preference of temporal voice areas as well as an emotion-related modulation of the medial frontal cortex and a task-modulated response of the lateral frontal cortex.","[Brueck, Carolin; Kreifelts, Benjamin; Wildgruber, Dirk] Univ Tubingen, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Brueck, Carolin; Goessling-Arnold, Christina; Wertheimer, Juergen; Wildgruber, Dirk] Werner Reichardt Ctr Integrat Neurosci CIN, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Goessling-Arnold, Christina; Wertheimer, Juergen] Univ Tubingen, Dept Comparat Literature, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany","Bruck, C (reprint author), Univ Tubingen, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Calwerstr 14, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.","Carolin.Brueck@med.uni-tuebingen.de","","Kreifelts, Benjamin/0000-0002-9233-3800","Werner Reichardt Centre for Integrative Neuroscience (CIN), Tubingen [CIN 2009-17]","This work was supported by the Werner Reichardt Centre for Integrative Neuroscience (CIN), Tubingen (CIN 2009-17).","","48","5","5","0","15","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

What determines inter-individual variability to impairments in behavioural control that may underlie road-traffic accidents, and impulsive and violent behaviours occurring under the influence of cannabis, the most widely used illicit drug worldwide? Method. Employing a double-blind, repeated-measures design, we investigated the genetic and neural basis of variable sensitivity to cannabis-induced behavioural dyscontrol in healthy occasional cannabis users. Acute oral challenge with placebo or.9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, was combined with functional magnetic resonance imaging, while participants performed a response inhibition task that involved inhibiting a prepotent motor response. They were genotyped for rs1130233 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the protein kinase B (AKT1) gene. Results. Errors of inhibition were significantly (p=0.008) increased following administration of THC in carriers of the A allele, but not in G allele homozygotes of the AKT1 rs1130233 SNP. The A allele carriers also displayed attenuation of left inferior frontal response with THC evident in the sample as a whole, while there was a modest enhancement of inferior frontal activation in the G homozygotes. There was a direct relationship (r=-0.327, p=0.045) between the behavioural effect of THC and its physiological effect in the inferior frontal gyrus, where AKT1 genotype modulated the effect of THC. Conclusions. These results require independent replication and show that differing vulnerability to acute psychomotor impairments induced by cannabis depends on variation in a gene that influences dopamine function, and is mediated through modulation of the effect of cannabis on the inferior frontal cortex, that is rich in dopaminergic innervation and critical for psychomotor control.","[Bhattacharyya, S.; Atakan, Z.; Prata, D.; McGuire, P.

In this study we used a new approach to functional MRI acquisition and analysis to characterize the neural responses during production and comprehension of complex real-life speech. First, using a time-warp based intrasubject correlation method, we identified all areas that are reliably activated in the brains of speakers telling a 15-min-long narrative. Next, we identified areas that are reliably activated in the brains of listeners as they comprehended that same narrative. This allowed us to identify networks of brain regions specific to production and comprehension, as well as those that are shared between the two processes. The results indicate that production of a real-life narrative is not localized to the left hemisphere but recruits an extensive bilateral network, which overlaps extensively with the comprehension system. Moreover, by directly comparing the neural activity time courses during production and comprehension of the same narrative we were able to identify not only the spatial overlap of activity but also areas in which the neural activity is coupled across the speaker's and listener's brains during production and comprehension of the same narrative. We demonstrate widespread bilateral coupling between production-and comprehension-related processing within both linguistic and nonlinguistic areas, exposing the surprising extent of shared processes across the two systems.","[Silbert, Lauren J.; Honey, Christopher J.; Simony, Erez; Hasson, Uri] Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Silbert, Lauren J.; Honey, Christopher J.; Simony, Erez; Hasson, Uri] Princeton Univ, Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Honey, Christopher J.] Univ Toronto, Dept Psychol, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada; [Poeppel, David] NYU, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10012 USA","Hasson, U (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.","hasson@princeton.edu","Honey, Christopher/C-3105-2015","Honey, Christopher/0000-0002-0745-5089; Hasson, Uri/0000-0002-3599-7168","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency-Broad Agency Announcement [12-03-SBIR]","We thank Michal Ben-Shachar, Forrest Collman, Janice Chen, Mor Regev, and Greg J.

The neural substrates of bilingual language control have been well investigated with language switching paradigm. Yet, most of those studies have taken single lexical items (i.e., words outside a context) as the investigative tool. In the present study, we examined the neural substrates of in-context language control in unbalanced bilinguals with a sentence-end switching paradigm. Our results showed that in-context language control in bilinguals recruited the neural mechanisms that were similar in kind to those responsible for cognitive control in general. When the direction of switching was considered, we found that backward switching called for more cognitive/language control relative to forward switching. Behaviorally, symmetric switching costs were found regardless of the switching factor (switching vs. non-switching) and the language factor (L1 vs. L2).

Image smoothing is an established post-processing technique used in the vast majority of fMRI studies. Here we show that the signal-to-noise ratio of the resulting smoothed data can be substantially increased by acquisition weighting with a weighting function that matches the k-space filter imposed by the smoothing operation. We derive the theoretical SNR advantage of this strategy and propose a practical implementation of 2D echo-planar acquisition matched to common Gaussian smoothing. To reliably perform the involved variable-speed trajectories, concurrent magnetic field monitoring with NMR probes is used. Using this technique, phantom and in vivo measurements confirm reliable SNR improvement in the order of 30% in a ""resting-state"" condition and prove robust in different regimes of physiological noise. Furthermore, a preliminary task-based visual fMRI experiment equally suggests a consistent BOLD sensitivity increase in terms of statistical sensitivity (average t-value increase of about 35%). In summary, our study suggests that matched-filter acquisition is an effective means of improving BOLD SNR in studies that rely on image smoothing at the post-processing level. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The working model in this area is that the anticipatory representations of others' behaviors require internal predictive models of actions formed from pre-established and shared representations between the observer and the actor. This model also predicts that observers would not be able to read accurately the intentions of a competitor if the competitor were to perform the action without prior knowledge of their intention until moments before the action. To test this hypothesis, we recorded brain activity from 25 male tennis players while they performed a novel behavioral tennis intention inference task, which included two conditions: (i) one condition in which they viewed video clips of a tennis athlete who knew in advance where he was about to act/serve (initially intended serves) and (ii) one condition in which they viewed video clips of that same athlete when he did not know where he was to act/serve until the target was specified after he had tossed the ball into the air to complete his serve (non-initially intended serves). Our results demonstrated that (i) tennis expertise is related to the accuracy in predicting where another server intends to serve when that server knows where he intends to serve before (but not after) he tosses the ball in the air; and (ii) accurate predictions are characterized by the recruitment of both cortical areas within the human mirror neuron system (that is known to be involved in higher-order (top-down) processes of embodied cognition and shared representation) and subcortical areas within brain regions involved in procedural memory (caudate nucleus). Interestingly, inaccurate predictions instead recruit areas known to be involved in low-level (bottom-up) computational processes associated with the sense of agency and self-other distinction.","[Cacioppo, Stephanie; Cacioppo, John T.] Univ Chicago, Dept Psychiat & Behav Neurosci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Cacioppo, Stephanie; Monteleone, George; Cacioppo, John T.] Univ Chicago, Ctr Cognit & Social Neurosci, High Performance Elect NeuroImaging Lab, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Fontang, Frederic] Tennis Acad, Pau, France; [Patel, Nisa] Western Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Grad Nursing, Pomona, CA USA; [Decety, Jean; Cacioppo, John T.] Univ Chicago, Brain Imaging Ctr, Dept Psychol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Cacioppo, S (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Ctr Cognit & Social Neurosci, High Performance Elect NeuroImaging Lab, 940 E 57th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.","scacioppo@bsd.uchicago.edu","","","Swiss National Science Foundation (FNS) [PP00_1_128599/1]","This study was supported by a professorship grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation (FNS# PP00_1_128599/1 to SC).

In today's paradigm of naturalistic neurosciences, subjects are exposed to rich contexts, such as video sequences or entire films, under relatively controlled conditions, against which researchers can interpret changes in neural responses within a time window. However, from the point of view of radical embodied cognitive neuroscience, the increasing complexity alone will not suffice as the explanatory apparatus for dynamical embodiment and situatedness of the mind. We suggest that narrative enactive systems with dynamically adaptive content as stimuli, may serve better to account for the embodied mind engaged with the surrounding world. Among the ensuing challenges for neuroimaging studies is how to interpret brain data against broad temporal contexts of previous experiences that condition the unfolding experience of nowness.

To investigate neural and behavioral correlates of the empathic processing of complex social scenarios, especially considering ecological validity of the experimental procedure, we developed and investigated a video stimulus inventory. It includes realistic neutral, social-positive, and reactive-aggressive action scenarios. Short video-clips showing these social scenarios from a first-person perspective triggering different emotional states were presented to a non-clinical sample of 20 young adult male participants during fMRI measurements. Both affective interaction conditions (social-positive and reactive-aggressive) were contrasted against a neutral baseline condition and against each other. Behavioral evaluation data largely confirmed the validity of the emotion-inducing stimulus material. Reactive-aggressive and social-positive interaction scenarios produced widely overlapping fMRI activation patterns in hetero-modal association cortices, but also in subcortical regions, such as the peri-aqueductal gray. Reactive-aggressive compared to social-positive scenarios yielded a more anterior distribution of activations in pre-motor and inferior frontal brain regions associated to motor-preparation and inhibitory control processing as well as in the insula associated to pain and/or aversion-processing.

For example, we can use an apparently straightforward sentence like ""It is hard to give a good presentation"" to convey deeper meanings, like ""Your talk was a mess!"" One of the big puzzles in language science is how listeners work out what speakers really mean, which is a skill absolutely central to communication. However, most neuroimaging studies of language comprehension have focused on the arguably much simpler, context-independent process of understanding direct utterances. To examine the neural systems involved in getting at contextually constrained indirect meaning, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging as people listened to indirect replies in spoken dialog. Relative to direct control utterances, indirect replies engaged dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, right temporo-parietal junction and insula, as well as bilateral inferior frontal gyrus and right medial temporal gyrus. This suggests that listeners take the speaker's perspective on both cognitive (theory of mind) and affective (empathy-like) levels. In line with classic pragmatic theories, our results also indicate that currently popular ""simulationist"" accounts of language comprehension fail to explain how listeners understand the speaker's intended message.","[Basnakova, Jana; Petersson, Karl Magnus; van Berkum, Jos; Hagoort, Peter] Max Planck Inst Psycholinguist, NL-6525 XD Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Basnakova, Jana] SAS, Inst Expt Psychol, Bratislava 81364, Slovakia; [Weber, Kirsten; Hagoort, Peter] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, NL-6525 EN Nijmegen, Netherlands; [van Berkum, Jos] Utrecht Inst Linguist OTS, NL-3512 JK Utrecht, Netherlands","Hagoort, P (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Psycholinguist, Wundtlaan 1, NL-6525 XD Nijmegen, Netherlands.","p.hagoort@mpi.nl","Petersson, Karl Magnus/E-8188-2012; Hagoort, Peter/B-7417-2012; Weber, Kirsten/U-5244-2018; GNC, GNC/B-5716-2013","Petersson, Karl Magnus/0000-0002-8245-0392; Weber, Kirsten/0000-0001-8192-2207; ","grant agency VEGA [2/0204/09]; NWO Vici grant [277-89-001]; NWO Toptalent Grant [021.001.007]","The first author was partly supported by grant agency VEGA (2/0204/09), J.v.B. was supported by NWO Vici grant (no. 277-89-001) and K.

We also examined the relationships among frame susceptibility, intelligence and personality measures. Participants evaluated whether personal attributes applied to themselves from multiple perspectives and in positive and negative frames. Participants rated whether each statement was descriptive or not and endorsed positive frames more than negative frames. Individual differences on frame decisions enabled us to form high and low frame susceptibility groups. Endorsement of frame-consistent attributes was associated with personality factors, cognitive reflection and intelligence. Reflexive brain regions were associated with positive frames while reflective areas were associated with negative frames. Region of Interest analyses showed that frame-inconsistent responses were associated with increased activation within reflective cognitive control regions including the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsomedial PFC and left ventrolateral PFC. Frame-consistent responses were associated with increased activation in the right orbitofrontal cortex.

Producing deception recruited the bilateral inferior parietal lobules (IPLs), right ventral lateral prefrontal (VLPF) areas and right striatum, among which the activation of the right VLPF contributed mostly to diagnosing the identities of the participants, correctly diagnosing 81.25% of 'murderers' and 81.25% of 'innocents'. Moreover, the participant's response when their deception was successful uniquely recruited the right middle frontal gyrus, bilateral IPLs, bilateral orbitofrontal cortices, bilateral middle temporal gyrus and left cerebellum, among which the right IPL contributed mostly to diagnosing participants' identities, correctly diagnosing 93.75% of murderers and 87.5% of innocents.

In this fMRI study, we investigated emotional reactivity to threat as possible link between provocation and aggression, as well as the neural correlates of this relationship. We hypothesized that emotional reactivity, measured as fear potentiation (FP) of the startle response, would be negatively associated with aggressive behavior and would modulate neural activity during an aggressive interaction. In 30 healthy female participants, FP was measured as the difference between blink amplitudes while watching threatening vs neutral pictures. Participants subsequently engaged in a variant of the Taylor Aggression Paradigm (TAP), while being scanned. During the TAP, participants selected a punishment level for either a highly provoking or a nonprovoking opponent. There was no difference in aggressive behavior between participants high and low in FP. However, we found a negative correlation between FP and the neural provocation effect in several regions of a network previously associated with mentalizing including the medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus and the temporo-parietal junction. Independently of the FP variability, aggressive behavior correlated with the provocation effect on activity in the caudate nucleus.

Participants in an fMRI study (n=48) gave rewards (money) or punishments (electroshocks) to in-group or out-group members. The results show that when participants rewarded others, greater activation was found in regions typically associated with receiving rewards such as the striatum and medial orbitofrontal cortex, bilaterally. Activation in those regions increased when participants rewarded in-group compared to out-group members. Punishment led to increased activation in regions typically associated with Theory of Mind including the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior superior temporal sulcus, as well as regions typically associated with perceiving others in pain such as the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula and lateral orbitofrontal cortex. Interestingly, in contrast to the findings regarding reward, activity in these regions was not moderated by whether the target of the punishment was an in- or out-group member. Additional regression analysis revealed that participants who have low perspective taking skills and higher levels of psychopathy showed less activation in the brain regions identified when punishing others, especially when they were out-group members. In sum, when an individual is personally responsible for delivering rewards and punishments to others, in-group bias is stronger for reward allocation than punishments, marking the first neuroscientific evidence of this dissociation.

A critical component of such development is to learn how to integrate the objective evaluation of one's behavior with the social response to the latter-here referred to as social feedback processing. Case report: We measured brain activity by means of fMRI in 33 healthy adolescents (12-19 years old, 14 females). Participants played a difficult perceptual game with integrated verbal and visual feedback. Verbal feedback provided the participants with objective performance evaluation (won vs. lost). Visual feedback consisted of either smiling or angry faces, representing positive or negative social evaluations. Together, the combination of verbal and visual feedback gave rise to congruent versus incongruent social feedback combinations. In addition to assessing sex differences, we further tested for the effects of age and attachment style on social feedback processing. Results revealed that brain activity during social feedback processing was significantly modulated by sex, age, and attachment style in prefrontal cortical areas, ventral anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, caudate, and amygdala/hippocampus. We found indication for heightened activity during incongruent social feedback processing in females, older participants, and individuals with an anxious attachment style. Conversely, we observed stronger activity during processing of congruent social feedback in males and participants with an avoidant attachment style. Conclusion: Our findings not only extend knowledge on the typical development of socio-emotional brain function during adolescence, but also provide first clues on how attachment insecurities, and particularly attachment avoidance, could interfere with the latter mechanisms.","[Vrticka, Pascal] Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Dept Social Neurosci, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Vrticka, Pascal] Stanford Univ, Ctr Interdisciplinary Brain Sci Res Psychiat & Be, Stanford, CA USA; [Sander, David; Anderson, Brittany] Univ Geneva, Swiss Ctr Affect Sci, Geneva, Switzerland; [Sander, David] Univ Geneva, Dept Psychol, Lab Study Emot Elicitat & Express, Geneva, Switzerland; [Badoud, Deborah; Debbane, Martin] Univ Geneva, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, Adolescence Clin Psychol Res Unit, Geneva, Switzerland; [Badoud, Deborah; Eliez, Stephan; Debbane, Martin] Univ Geneva, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Off Medicopedag Res Unit, Geneva, Switzerland; [Eliez, Stephan] Univ Geneva, Sch Med, Dept Genet Med & Dev, Geneva, Switzerland; [Debbane, Martin] UCL, Res Dept Clin Educ & Hlth Psychol, London, England","Vrticka, P (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Dept Social Neurosci, Room C304,Stephanstr 1A, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.","vrticka@cbs.mpg.de","Vrticka, Pascal/U-9166-2018","Vrticka, Pascal/0000-0002-8920-5509; Debbane, Martin/0000-0002-4677-8753","Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [100014-135311/1, PP00B-102864, 136480]; National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) ""Synapsy-The Synaptic Bases of Mental Diseases"" (SNSF) [51AU40_125759]; Gertrude Von Meissner Foundation [ME 7871]; NCCR Affective Sciences - Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [51NF40-104897]","This research was supported by research grants from the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF, no. 100014-135311/1) to M.

It remains unknown whether a specific genetic polymorphism may influence the association between cultural traits and neural activity in the social brain network. We tested whether the serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) affects the association between self-construals and neural activity involved in reflection of personal attributes of oneself and a significant other (i.e., mother). Using functional MRI, we scanned Chinese adults with short/short (s/s) or long/long (l/l) variants of the 5-HTTLPR during reflection of personal attributes of oneself and one's mother. We found that, while s/s and l/l genotype groups did not differ significantly in self-construals measured by the Self-Construal Scale, the relationship between self-construal scores and neural responses to reflection of oneself and mother was significantly different between the two genotype groups. Specifically, l/l but not s/s genotype group showed significant association between self-construal scores and activity in the medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral middle frontal cortex, temporoparietal junction, insula and hippocampus during reflection on mental attributes of oneself and mother. Our findings suggest that a specific genetic polymorphism may interact with a cultural trait to shape the neural substrates underlying social cognition.","[Ma, Yina; Wang, Chenbo; Han, Shihui] Peking Univ, Dept Psychol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Ma, Yina; Wang, Chenbo; Li, Bingfeng; Zhang, Wenxia; Rao, Yi; Han, Shihui] Peking Univ, PKU IDG McGovern Inst Brain Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Li, Bingfeng; Zhang, Wenxia; Rao, Yi] Peking Univ, Sch Life Sci, Peking Tsinghua Ctr Life Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","Ma, YN (reprint author), Peking Univ, Dept Psychol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.","yina.ma@pku.edu.cn; shan@pku.edu.cn","Ma, Yina/H-6203-2017","Ma, Yina/0000-0002-5457-0354","National Natural Science Foundation of China [30910103901, 91024032, 81161120539]; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) [2010CB833901, 2010CB833903]","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project 30910103901, 91024032, 81161120539) and National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program 2010CB33901, 2010CB833903).","","55","10","11","1","23","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

Although dopaminergic (D2) transmission in the ventral striatum (VS) is associated with motivation, learning, and cognition are more strongly associated with function of the dorsal striatum, including activation in the caudate nucleus. A recent study found an interaction between intrinsic motivation and the DRD2/ANKK1 polymorphism (rs1800497), suggesting that A-carriers of rs1800497 are significantly more sensitive to motivation in order to improve during working memory (WM) training. Using data from the two large-scale imaging genetic data sets, IMAGEN (n = 1080, age 13-15 years) and BrainChild (n 300, age 6-27), we investigated whether rs 1800497 is associated with WM. In the IMAGEN data set, we tested whether VS/caudate activation during reward anticipation was associated with WM performance and whether rs1800497 and VS/caudate activation interact to affect WM performance. We found that rs1800497 was associated with WM performance in IMAGEN and BrainChild. Higher VS and caudate activation during reward processing were significantly associated with higher WM performance (p < 0.0001). An interaction was found between the DRD2/ANKK1 polymorphism rs 1800497 and VS activation during reward anticipation on WM (p < 0.01), such that carriers of the minor allele (A) showed a significant correlation between VS activation and WM, whereas the GG-homozygotes did not, suggesting that the effect of VS BOLD on WM is modified by inter-individual genetic differences related to D2 dopaminergic transmission.","Karolinska Inst, Dept Neurosci, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Nymberg, Charlotte; Klingberg, Torkel] Cent Inst Mental Hlth, Dept Child & Adolescent Psychiat, Mannheim, Germany; [Banaschewski, Tobias; Flor, Herta; Nees, Frauke; Rietschel, Marcella] Heidelberg Univ, Med Fac Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany; [Bokde, Arun L.

This attribution of agency to ourselves or to an external event influences our behavioral and affective response to the outcomes. Despite its special importance to understanding human motivation and affect, the neural mechanisms involved in self-attributed rewards and punishments remain unclear. Previous evidence implicates the anterior insula (AI) in evaluating the consequences of our own actions. However, it is unclear if the AI has a general role in feedback evaluation (positive and negative) or plays a specific role during error processing. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a motion prediction task, we investigate neural responses to self-and externally attributed monetary gains and losses. We found that attribution effects vary according to the valence of feedback: significant valence 3 attribution interactions in the right AI, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the midbrain, and the right ventral putamen. Self-attributed losses were associated with increased activity in the midbrain, the ACC and the right AI, and negative BOLD response in the ventral putamen. However, higher BOLD activity to self-attributed feedback (losses and gains) was observed in the left AI, the thalamus, and the cerebellar vermis. These results suggest a functional lateralization of the AI. The right AI, together with the midbrain and the ACC, is mainly involved in processing the salience of the outcome, whereas the left is part of a cerebello-thalamic-cortical pathway involved in cognitive control processes important for subsequent behavioral adaptations.

The Mirror System is involved in goal understanding and has been associated with several emotional and cognitive functions central to social interaction, ranging from empathy to gestural communication and imitation. The Mentalizing System is recruited in tasks requiring cognitive processes such as self-reference and understanding of other's intentions. Although theoretical accounts for an interaction between the two systems have been proposed, little is known about their synergy during social exchanges. In order to explore this question, we have recorded brain activity by means of functional MRI during live social exchanges based on reciprocal imitation of hand gestures. Here, we investigate, using the method of psychophysiological interaction, the changes in functional connectivity of the Mirror System due to the conditions of interest (being imitated, imitating) compared with passive observation of hand gestures. We report a strong coupling between the Mirror System and the Mentalizing System during the imitative exchanges. Our findings suggest a complementary role of the two networks during social encounters. The Mirror System would engage in the preparation of own actions and the simulation of other's actions, while the Mentalizing System would engage in the anticipation of the other's intention and thus would participate to the co-regulation of reciprocal actions. Beyond a specific effect of imitation, the design used offers the opportunity to tackle the role of role-switching in an interpersonal account of social cognition.","[Sperduti, Marco; Guionnet, Sophie; Fossati, Philippe; Nadel, Jacqueline] Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, Ctr Emot, CNRS, USR 3246, F-75651 Paris, France; [Fossati, Philippe] Univ Paris 06, Paris, France; [Fossati, Philippe] Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, AP HP, Dept Psychiat, Paris, France","Sperduti, M (reprint author), Hop La Pitie Salpetriere, Ctr Emot, CNRS, USR 3246, 47 Bd Hop, F-75651 Paris, France.","marcosperduti@yahoo.it; jacqueline.nadel@upmc.fr","","Sperduti, Marco/0000-0002-0974-8811","","","","56","26","26","0","34","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","1612-4782","1612-4790","","COGN PROCESS","Cogn.

Although the topography of face, scene, and object-preferring modules in the human brain is well established, the functional characterization, in terms of dynamic selectivity across their nodes is still elusive. Here, we use long trials of perceptually impoverished images of faces and objects to assess the dynamics of BOLD activity and selectivity induced by perceptual closure within these regions of interest. Departing from paradigms involving immediate percepts, we used ambiguous images favoring holistic search and independence from low level stimulus properties. By assessing the neural responses to images that go beyond the preferred category of the studied ROIs we could dissect the specificity of these processes as a function of the timing of perceptual closure and contribute to the debate regarding specialization of these modules. We found that pSTS is a notable exception to the observation that category selective high-level visual areas also participate on the perceptual closure of their non-preferred category. A similar observation was found for PPA responses to faces. Most importantly, these observations directly link the pSTS region with the social processing network, which cannot be engaged by object stimuli. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

And if it does, what are the mechanisms affected? We addressed these questions by studying the abilities of Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) operators, who must identify the presence of hostile intentions using only visual cues in complex scenes. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess which brain processes are modulated by CCTV experience. To this end we scanned 15 CCTV operators and 15 age and gender matched novices while they watched CCTV videos of 16 sec, and asked them to report whether each clip would end in violence or not. We carried out four separate whole-brain analyses including 3 model-based analyses and one analysis of intersubject correlation to examine differences between the two groups. The three model analyses were based on 1) experimentally pre-defined clip activity labels of fight, confrontation, playful, and neutral behaviour, 2) participants' reports of violent outcomes during the scan, and 3) visual saliency within each clip, as pre-assessed using eye-tracking. The analyses identified greater activation in the right superior frontal gyrus for operators than novices when viewing playful behaviour, and reduced activity for operators in comparison with novices in the occipital and temporal regions, irrespective of the type of clips viewed. However, in the parahippocampal gyrus, all three model-based analyses consistently showed reduced activity for experienced CCTV operators. Activity in the anterior part of the parahippocampal gyrus (uncus) was found to increase with years of CCTV experience. The intersubject correlation analysis revealed a further effect of experience, with CCTV operators showing correlated activity in fewer brain regions (superior and middle temporal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule and the ventral striatum) than novices. Our results indicate that long visual experience in action observation, aimed to predict harmful behaviour, modulates brain mechanisms of intent recognition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

An open question is whether elderly still have the flexibility to adapt functional network connectivity (FNC) to the demands of the task at hand. To study this, we collected fMRI data in younger and older participants during resting state, a selective attention (SA) task and an n-back working memory task with varying levels of difficulty. Spatial independent component (IC) analysis was used to identify functional networks over all participants and all conditions. Dual regression was used to obtain participant and task specific time-courses per IC. Subsequently, functional connectivity was computed between all ICs in each of the tasks. Based on these functional connectivity matrices, a scaled version of the eigenvector centrality (SEC) was used to measure the total influence of each IC in the complete graph of ICs. The results demonstrated that elderly remain able to adapt FNC to task demands. However, there was an age-related shift in the impetus for FNC change. Older participants showed the maximal change in SEC patterns between resting state and the SA task. Young participants, showed the largest shift in SEC patterns between the less demanding SA task and the more demanding 2-back task. Our results suggest that increased FNC changes from resting state to low demanding tasks in elderly reflect recruitment of additional resources, compared with young adults. The lack of change between the low and high demanding tasks suggests that elderly reach a resource ceiling.

One possibility is that acting with a group can reduce spontaneous self-referential processing in the moral domain and, in turn, facilitate competitor harm. We tested this hypothesis in an fMRI experiment in which (i) participants performed a competitive task once alone and once with a group; (ii) spontaneous self-referential processing during competition was indexed unobtrusively by activation in an independently localized region of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) associated with self-reference; and (iii) we assessed participants' willingness to harm competitors versus teammates. As predicted, participants who showed reduced mPFC activation in response to descriptions of their own moral behaviors while competing in a group were more willing to harm competitors. These results suggest that intergroup competition (above and beyond inter-personal competition) can reduce self-referential processing of moral information, enabling harmful behaviors towards members of a competitive group.

There are marked individual differences in this balance such that individualists tend to favor themselves whereas prosocials tend to favor the group. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this difference has important implications for society and its institutions. Using behavioral and fMRI data collected during the performance of the ultimatum game, we show that individual differences in social preferences for resource allocation, so-called ""social value orientation,"" is linked with activity in the nucleus accumbens and amygdala elicited by inequity, rather than activity in insula, ACC, and dorsolateral pFC. Importantly, the presence of cognitive load made prosocials behave more prosocially and individualists more individualistically, suggesting that social value orientation is driven more by intuition than reflection. In parallel, activity in the nucleus accumbens and amygdala, in response to inequity, tracked this behavioral pattern of prosocials and individualists. In addition, we conducted an impunity game experiment with different participants where they could not punish unfair behavior and found that the inequity-correlated activity seen in prosocials during the ultimatum game disappeared. This result suggests that the accumbens and amygdala activity of prosocials encodes ""outcome-oriented emotion"" designed to change situations (i.e., achieve equity or punish). Together, our results suggest a pivotal contribution of the nucleus accumbens and amygdala to individual differences in sociality.","[Haruno, Masahiko] NICT, Ctr Informat & Neural Networks, Osaka, Japan; [Haruno, Masahiko] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, PRESTO, Tokyo, Japan; [Kimura, Minoru] Tamagawa Univ, Brain Sci Inst, Tokyo, Japan; [Frith, Christopher D.] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Frith, Christopher D.] Univ Aarhus, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","Haruno, M (reprint author), NICT CINET, 1-4 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.","mharuno@nict.go.jp","","","PRESTO from JST, KAKENHI [22300139]; Strategic Research Program for Brain Sciences by MEXT; Wellcome Trust; Danish National Research Foundation","We are grateful to Dr. Haji for technical assistance with fMRI.

During fMRI scanning, participants detected 'oddballs' (objects with a specific frame color) intermixed with objects participants had previously imagined belonging to them or to someone else and previously unseen non-oddball objects. There was greater activity in MPFC and posterior cingulate cortex for those 'self-owned' objects that participants were more successful at imagining owning compared with 'other-owned' objects.

Resolving emotional conflict: A role for the rostral anterior cingulate cortex in modulating activity in the amygdala. Neuron. 52:871), in abstract processing. For abstract words, activation in this area was modulated by the hedonic valence (degree of positive or negative affective association) of our items. A correlation analysis of more than 1,400 English words further showed that abstract words, in general, receive higher ratings for affective associations (both valence and arousal) than concrete words, supporting the view that engagement of emotional processing is generally required for processing abstract words. We argue that these results support embodiment views of semantic representation, according to which, whereas concrete concepts are grounded in our sensory-motor experience, affective experience is crucial in the grounding of abstract concepts.","[Vigliocco, Gabriella; Vinson, David P.; Devlin, Joseph T.] UCL, Div Psychol & Language Sci, Cognit Perceptual & Brain Sci Res Dept, London WC1H OAP, England; [Kousta, Stavroula-Thaleia] Cell Press, Trends Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Della Rosa, Pasquale Anthony; Tettamanti, Marco; Cappa, Stefano F.] Univ Vita Salute San Raffaele, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Della Rosa, Pasquale Anthony; Tettamanti, Marco; Cappa, Stefano F.] DIBIT, San Raffaele Sci Inst, I-20132 Milan, Italy","Vigliocco, G (reprint author), UCL, Div Psychol & Language Sci, Cognit Perceptual & Brain Sci Res Dept, London WC1H OAP, England.","g.vigliocco@ucl.ac.uk","","Kousta, Stavroula/0000-0002-4664-9628; Devlin, Joseph/0000-0001-9737-3070; Vigliocco, Gabriella/0000-0002-7190-3659","European Union [028714]; ESRC [RES-062-23-2012]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G045828/1]","The work reported here has been supported by European Union (FP6-2004-NESTPATH, grant 028714 to S.

Participants were presented with picture and sound stimuli that differed in positive or negative valence in an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment. Global statistical tests, applied at a level of the individual, demonstrated significant sensitivity to valence within modality, but not valence across modalities. Modality-general and modality-specific valence hypotheses predict distinctly different multidimensional patterns of the stimulus conditions. Examination of lower dimensional representation of the data demonstrated separable dimensions for valence processing within each modality. These results provide support for modality-specific valence processing in an incidental affective processing paradigm at a whole-brain level of analysis.

In economics, demand refers to the relationship between a commodity's consumption and its cost, and, in behavioral studies, high alcohol demand has been consistently associated with greater alcohol misuse. Relatively little is known about how the brain processes demand decision making, and the current study is an initial investigation of the neural correlates of alcohol demand among heavy drinkers. Using an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm, participants (N = 24) selected how much they would drink under varying levels of price. These choices determined access to alcohol during a subsequent bar laboratory self-administration period. During decisions to drink in general, greater activity was present in multiple distinct subunits of the prefrontal and parietal cortices. In contrast, during decisions to drink that were demonstrably affected by the cost of alcohol, significantly greater activation was evident in frontostriatal regions, suggesting an active interplay between cognitive deliberation and subjective reward value. These choices were also characterized by significant deactivation in default mode network regions, suggesting suppression resulting from greater cognitive load. Across choice types, the anterior insula was notably recruited in diverse roles, further implicating the importance of interoceptive processing in decision-making behavior. These findings reveal the neural signatures subserving alcohol cost benefit decision making, providing a foundation for future clinical applications of this paradigm and extending this approach to understanding the neural correlates of demand for other addictive commodities.","[MacKillop, James; Amlung, Michael T.; Acker, John; Gray, Joshua C.; Brown, Courtney L.; Sweet, Lawrence H.] Univ Georgia, Dept Psychol, Athens, GA 30605 USA; [MacKillop, James; Murphy, James G.] Brown Univ, Dept Behav & Social Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Amlung, Michael T.] Univ Missouri, Dept Psychol Sci, Columbia, MO USA; [Murphy, James G.] Univ Memphis, Dept Psychol, Memphis, TN 38152 USA; [Ray, Lara A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Sweet, Lawrence H.] Brown Univ, Dept Psychiat & Human Behav, Providence, RI 02912 USA","MacKillop, J (reprint author), Univ Georgia, Dept Psychol, 100 Hooper St, Athens, GA 30605 USA.","jmackill@uga.edu","","","NIH [K23 AA016936, P30 DA027827]; University of Georgia Research Foundation Faculty grant; UGA BioImaging Research Center","We are very grateful for the contributions of the Research Assistants of the UGA Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology Laboratory and to Max Owens for editorial assistance.

Mnemonic representations of object-related actions( action codes) evoked by the sight of an object may constrain and hence facilitate recognition of unrolling actions. The present fMRI study investigated if and how action codes influence brain activation during action observation. The average number of action codes (NAC) of 51 sets of objects was rated by a group of n= 24 participants. In an fMRI study, different volunteers were asked to recognize actions performed with the same objects presented in short videos. To disentangle areas reflecting the storage of action codes from those exploiting them, we showed object-compatible and object-incompatible ( pantomime) actions. Areas storing action codes were considered to positively co-vary with NAC in both object-compatible and object-incompatible action; due to its role in tool-related tasks, we here hypothesized left anterior inferior parietal cortex (aIPL). Incontrast, areas exploiting action codes were expected to show this correlation only in object-compatible but not incompatible action, as only object-compatible actions match one of the active action codes. For this interaction, we hypothesized ventrolateral premotorcortex (PMv) to join aIPL due to its role in biasing competition in IPL. We found left anterior intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and left posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) to co-vary with NAC. In addition to these areas, action codes increased activity in object-compatible action in bilateral PMv, right IPS, and lateral occipital cortex (LO). Findings suggest that during action observation, the brain derives possible actions from perceived objects, and uses this information to shape action recognition.

Variations in caregivers' emotional reactivity to unpleasant child-feedback may be partially explained by their dispositional empathy levels. Furthermore, empathic response to the child's unpleasant feedback likely helps mothers to regulate their own stress. We investigated the relationship between maternal dispositional empathy, stress reactivity, and neural correlates of child feedback to caregiving decisions. In Part 1 of the study, 33 female participants were recruited to undergo a lab-based mild stressor, the Social Evaluation Test (SET), and then in Part 2 of the study, a subset of the participants, 14 mothers, performed a Parenting Decision Making Task (PDMT) in an fMRI setting. Four dimensions of dispositional empathy based on the Interpersonal Reactivity Index were measured in all participants-Personal Distress, Empathic Concern, Perspective Taking, and Fantasy. Overall, we found that the Personal Distress and Perspective Taking were associated with greater and lesser cortisol reactivity, respectively. The four types of empathy were distinctly associated with the negative (vs. positive) child feedback activation in the brain. Personal Distress was associated with amygdala and hypothalamus activation, Empathic Concern with the left ventral striatum, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), and supplemental motor area (SMA) activation, and Fantasy with the septal area, right SMA and VLPFC activation. Interestingly, hypothalamus-septal coupling during the negative feedback condition was associated with less PDMT-related cortisol reactivity.

Previous studies on how we control these tendencies have focused on reactive mechanisms, where inhibition of imitation is implemented after seeing an action. This work suggests that reactive control of imitation draws on at least partially specialized mechanisms. Here, we examine preparatory imitation control, where advance information allows control processes to be employed before an action is observed. Drawing on dual route models from the spatial compatibility literature, we compare control processes using biological and non-biological stimuli to determine whether preparatory imitation control recruits specialized neural systems that are similar to those observed in reactive imitation control. Results indicate that preparatory control involves anterior prefrontal, dorsolateral prefrontal, posterior parietal and early visual cortices regardless of whether automatic responses are evoked by biological (imitative) or non-biological stimuli. These results indicate both that preparatory control of imitation uses general mechanisms, and that preparatory control of imitation draws on different neural systems from reactive imitation control. Based on the regions involved, we hypothesize that preparatory control is implemented through top-down attentional biasing of visual processing.","[Cross, Katy A.; Iacoboni, Marco] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Interdept Neurosci Program, Los Angeles, CA 90035 USA; [Cross, Katy A.; Iacoboni, Marco] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Ahmanson Lovelace Brain Mapping Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90035 USA; [Iacoboni, Marco] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychiat & Biobehav Sci, Semel Inst Neurosci & Human Behav, Los Angeles, CA 90035 USA; [Iacoboni, Marco] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Brain Res Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90035 USA","Cross, KA (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Interdept Neurosci Program, Los Angeles, CA 90035 USA.","katycross@ucla.edu","","","National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) [RR12169, RR13642, RR00865]; National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health (NIH) [5F30MH091808-02]; Brain Mapping Medical Research Organization; Brain Mapping Support Foundation; Pierson-Lovelace Foundation; Ahmanson Foundation; William M. and Linda R.

However, recent studies indicate that the effects of intranasal oxytocin are more nuanced than previously thought and that contextual factors and individual characteristics moderate the beneficiary oxytocin effects. In this randomized-controlled trial we examine the influence of intranasally administered oxytocin on neural activity during mind-reading with fMRI, taking into account harsh caregiving experiences as a potential moderator. Participants were 50 women who received a nasal spray containing either 16 IU of oxytocin or a placebo and had reported how often their mother used love withdrawal as a disciplinary strategy. Participants performed an adapted version of the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), a task which requires individuals to infer mental states by looking at photographs of the eye region of faces. We found that oxytocin enhanced neural activation in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and insula during the RMET. Moreover, oxytocin increased RMET performance outside the scanner. However, the oxytocin induced changes in STG activation and RMET performance were only brought about in potentially less socially proficient individuals who had low RMET performance, that is, participants reporting higher levels of maternal love withdrawal.

However, frequent exposure to emotionally-demanding situations may put people at risk for burnout. Burnout has become a pervasive problem among medical professionals because occupational burnout may be highly sensitive to empathy levels. To better understand empathy-induced burnout among medical professionals, exploring the relationship between burnout severity and strength of empathy-related brain activity may be key. However, to our knowledge, this relationship has not yet been explored. We studied the relationship between self-reported burnout severity scores and psychological measures of empathic disposition, emotional dissonance and alexithymia in medical professionals to test two contradictory hypotheses: Burnout is explained by (1) 'compassion fatigue'; that is, individuals become emotionally over involved; and (2) 'emotional dissonance'; that is, a gap between felt and expressed emotion, together with reduced emotional regulation. Then, we tested whether increased or decreased empathy-related brain activity measured by fMRI was associated with burnout severity scores and psychological measures. The results showed that burnout severity of medical professionals is explained by 'reduced' empathy-related brain activity. Moreover, this reduced brain activity is correlated with stronger emotional dissonance and alexithymia scores and also greater empathic disposition. We speculate that reduced emotion recognition (that is, alexithymia) might potentially link with stronger emotional dissonance and greater burnout severity alongside empathy-related brain activity. In this view, greater empathic disposition in individuals with higher burnout levels might be due to greater difficulty identifying their own emotional reactions. Our study sheds new light on the ability to predict empathy-induced burnout.","[Tei, S.; Kawada, R.; Fujino, J.; Sugihara, G.; Murai, T.; Takahashi, H.] Kyoto Univ, Dept Psychiat, Grad Sch Med, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Tei, S.] Waseda Univ, Inst Appl Brain Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Tei, S.] Tokyo Int Univ, Dept Human Dev & Sport Sci, Sch Human & Social Sci, Saitama, Japan; [Becker, C.] Kyoto Univ, Kokoro Res Ctr, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Jankowski, K.

Social cues from others are exceptionally salient, particularly during adolescence. Understanding how adolescents interpret and learn from variable social signals can provide insight into the observed shift in social sensitivity during this period. The present study tested 120 participants between the ages of 8 and 25 years on a social reinforcement learning task where the probability of receiving positive social feedback was parametrically manipulated. Seventy-eight of these participants completed the task during fMRI scanning. Modeling trial-by-trial learning, children and adults showed higher positive learning rates than did adolescents, suggesting that adolescents demonstrated less differentiation in their reaction times for peers who provided more positive feedback. Forming expectations about receiving positive social reinforcement correlated with neural activity within the medial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum across age. Adolescents, unlike children and adults, showed greater insular activity during positive prediction error learning and increased activity in the supplementary motor cortex and the putamen when receiving positive social feedback regardless of the expected outcome, suggesting that peer approval may motivate adolescents toward action. While different amounts of positive social reinforcement enhanced learning in children and adults, all positive social reinforcement equally motivated adolescents. Together, these findings indicate that sensitivity to peer approval during adolescence goes beyond simple reinforcement theory accounts and suggest possible explanations for how peers may motivate adolescent behavior.","[Jones, Rebecca M.; Ruberry, Erika J.; Powers, Alisa; Mehta, Natasha; Casey, B.

In an fMRI study, we presented pictures of a person engaged in everyday activities (social stimuli) or of objects (non-social stimuli) and induced a higher level of construal by instructing participants to generate personality traits of the person or categories to which the objects belonged.

Employing an event-related fMRI design, we examined for changes of activity in face- and number-related posterior brain regions (right fusiform face area (FFA) and right intraparietal sulcus (IPSnum), respectively), and explored the functional connectivity of these areas with other brain regions, during the (preparation) interval between cue onset and onset of the (to-be-responded) target stimulus. The results revealed task-relevant posterior brain regions to be modulated during this period: activation in task-relevant stimulus-specific regions was selectively enhanced and their functional connectivity to task-relevant anterior brain regions strengthened (right FFA - face task, right IPSnum - number task) while participants prepared for the cued task. Additionally, activity in task-relevant posterior brain regions was influenced by residual activation from the preceding trial in the right FFA and the right IPSnum, respectively. These findings indicate that, during task preparation, the activation pattern in currently task-relevant posterior brain regions is shaped by residual activation as well as preparatory modulation prior to the onset of the critical stimulus, even without participants being instructed to imagine the stimulus.

Recent reports of heterogeneity within the network raise the possibility that these autobiographical processes comprised of multiple component processes, each supported by distinct functional-anatomic subsystems. We previously hypothesized that a medial temporal subsystem contributes to autobiographical memory and future thought by enabling individuals to retrieve prior information and bind this information into a mental scene. Conversely, a dorsal medial subsystem was proposed to support social-reflective aspects of autobiographical thought, allowing individuals to reflect on the mental states of one's self and others (i.e. ""mentalizing""). To test these hypotheses, we first examined activity in the default network subsystems as participants performed two commonly employed tasks of episodic retrieval and mentalizing. In a subset of participants, relationships among task-evoked regions were examined at rest, in the absence of an overt task. Finally, large-scale fMRI meta-analyses were conducted to identify brain regions that most strongly predicted the presence of episodic retrieval and mentalizing, and these results were compared to meta-analyses of autobiographical tasks. Across studies, laboratory-based episodic retrieval tasks were preferentially linked to the medial temporal subsystem, while mentalizing tasks were preferentially linked to the dorsal medial subsystem. In turn, autobiographical tasks engaged aspects of both subsystems. These results suggest the default network is a heterogeneous brain system whose subsystems support distinct component processes of autobiographical thought. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This experiment tested whether neural activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and anterior insula in response to social rejection predicted greater subsequent aggression. Additionally, it tested whether executive functioning moderated this relationship. Participants completed a behavioral measure of executive functioning, experienced social rejection while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging and then completed a task in which they could aggress against a person who rejected them using noise blasts . We found that dACC activation and executive functioning interacted to predict aggression. Specifically, participants with low executive functioning showed a positive association between dACC activation and aggression, whereas individuals with high executive functioning showed a negative association.

It has only recently been investigated using brain imaging techniques. In most studies, participants are instructed by a cue to inhibit a specific emotional reaction. The aim of the present study was to investigate the alternative situation where a person decides to inhibit an emotion as an act of endogenous self-control. Healthy participants viewed highly arousing pictures with negative valence. In the endogenous condition, participants could freely choose on each trial to inhibit or feel the emotions elicited by the picture. In an exogenous condition, a visual cue instructed them to either feel or inhibit the emotion elicited by the picture. Participants' subjective ratings of intensity of experienced emotion showed an interaction effect between source of control (endogenous/exogenous) and feel/inhibit based on a stronger modulation between feel and inhibition for the endogenous compared to the exogenous condition. Endogenous inhibition of emotions was associated with dorso-medial prefrontal cortex activation, whereas exogenous inhibition was found associated with lateral prefrontal cortex activation. Thus, the brain regions for both endogenous and exogenous inhibition of emotion are highly similar to those for inhibition of motor actions in Brass and Haggard (J Neurosci 27:9141-9145, 2007), Kuhn et al. (Hum Brain Mapp 30:2834-2843, 2009). Functional connectivity analyses showed that dorsofrontomedial cortex exerts greater control onto pre-supplementary motor area during endogenous inhibition compared to endogenous feel. This functional dissociation between an endogenous, fronto-medial and an exogenous, fronto-lateral inhibition centre has important implications for our understanding of emotion regulation in health and psychopathology.","[Kuhn, Simone; Brass, Marcel] Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Psychol, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, Ghent Inst Funct & Metab Imaging, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Kuhn, Simone; Haggard, Patrick] UCL, Inst Cognit Neurosci, Dept Psychol, London WC1N 3AR, England","Kuhn, S (reprint author), Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Psychol, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, Ghent Inst Funct & Metab Imaging, Henri Dunantlaan 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.","kuehn@mpib-berlin.mpg.de","Kuhn, Simone/P-6145-2014; Brass, Marcel/J-7082-2012","Brass, Marcel/0000-0002-3364-4019; Haggard, Patrick/0000-0001-7798-793X","ESRC [RES-062-23-2183, ES/J023140/1]; Leverhulme Trust; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J023140/1]","SK is a Postdoctoral Fellow of the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO).

What determines if individuals will subsequently adjust their behavior to align with collective choices? Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans, we characterize a novel temporal model of brain response from the time a collective decision is made to the time an individual action is required. We reveal that whether a behavioral modification will occur is determined not necessarily by the brain's response to the initial social influence, but by how that response (specifically in the orbitofrontal cortex; OFC) is mirrored at a later time when the individual selects their own action. This result suggests that the OFC may reconstitute an initial state of collective influence when individual action is subsequently needed. Importantly, these dynamics vary across individuals as a function of trait conformity and mediate the relationship between this personality characteristic and behavioral adjustment toward the group.","[Charpentier, Caroline J.; Moutsiana, Christina; Garrett, Neil; Sharot, Tali] UCL, Dept Cognit Perceptual & Brain Sci, Div Psychol & Language Sci, Affect Brain Lab, London WC1N 3AR, England; [Charpentier, Caroline J.] UCL, Inst Cognit Neurosci, London WC1N 3AR, England","Charpentier, CJ (reprint author), Inst Cognit Neurosci, 17 Queen Sq, London WC1N 3AR, England.","caroline.charpentier.11@ucl.ac.uk","","","Wellcome Trust Career Development Fellowship; UCL Grand Challenge award","This work was supported by a Wellcome Trust Career Development Fellowship to T.S., and a UCL Grand Challenge award to C.J.C.

Ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) has routinely been implicated in social cognitive tasks that rely on such absolute judgments about the self or others, but it is unclear whether activity in this region is modulated by personal relevance of social stimuli or self-similarity of judgment targets. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate that these forces interact to determine vmPFC response during social comparisons, as well as neural activity in the bilateral anterior insulae. Comparisons between the self and similar others exhibit a unique response in this region when compared with other judgment contexts, suggesting that the special psychological status afforded to these social comparisons is indexed by activity in the vmPFC and insula.","[Moore, William E., III; Merchant, Junaid S.; Kahn, Lauren E.; Pfeifer, Jennifer H.] Univ Oregon, Dept Psychol, Eugene, OR 97401 USA","Moore, WE (reprint author), Univ Oregon, Dept Psychol, Eugene, OR 97401 USA.","wem3@uoregon.edu","","Moore, Will/0000-0002-7012-7803","NICHD NIH HHS [L40HD059442]; NIMH NIH HHS [L40 MH087356, L40MH087356]","","","34","11","11","0","12","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

In the current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we directly tested this hypothesis by investigating whether medial prefrontal activity in error observation is restricted to situations that enable simulation. To this aim, we compared brain activity related to the observation of errors that can be simulated (human errors) with brain activity related to errors that cannot be simulated (machine errors). We show that medial prefrontal activity is not only restricted to the observation of human errors but also occurs when observing errors of a machine.

One group of participants were primed to increase mortality salience and another group were primed with negative affect in terms of fear/anxiety. We found that perceiving painful vs non-painful stimuli in the pre-priming session activated the midcingulate/dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (MCC/dMPFC), bilateral anterior insula/inferior frontal cortex, bilateral secondary somatosensory cortex and left middle temporal gyrus. However, MCC/dMPFC activity in response to perceived pain in others was significantly decreased in the post-priming session by the mortality salience priming, but was not influenced by the negative affect priming. Moreover, subjective fear of death induced by the priming procedures mediated the change in MCC/dMPFC activity across the priming procedures. Subjective fear of death also moderated the co-variation of MCC/dMPFC and left insular activity during perception of others in pain.

For example, adults usually interpret some as some but not all. On the basis of behavioral research, it has been suggested that processing implicatures is cognitively costly. However, many studies have used cases where sentences with some did not match the context in which they were presented. Our study aimed to examine whether the processing cost is linked to implicature generation, to the mismatch between the implicature and the context, or to both processes. To do so, we explored the neural patterns of implicature generation and implicature mismatch using fMRI. Thirteen participants performed a sentence-picture matching task (where pictures determined the context) with mismatched implicatures, successful implicatures or no implicature conditions. Several brain regions were identified when comparing cases of implicature mismatch and cases without implicatures. One of these regions, left-IFG, was jointly activated for mismatched and successful implicatures, as observed in a conjunction analysis. By contrast, left-MFG and medial-frontal-gyrus, were identified when comparing cases of implicature mismatch with cases of successful implicatures. Thus, the left IFG can be interpreted as being linked to implicature generation, whereas the other two areas seem to participate in the processing of the mismatch between the implicature and its context. Our results indicate that scalar implicatures induce processing cost in different ways. This should be considered in future research. Hum Brain Mapp 35:1503-1514, 2014.

Such imitative biases are thought to have evolved because they increase the efficiency of cultural acquisition. Here we focused on distinguishing between self-similarity and social status as two candidate mechanisms underlying neural responses to a person's race during imitation. We used fMRI to measure neural responses when 20 African American (AA) and 20 European American (EA) young adults imitated AA, EA and Chinese American (CA) models and also passively observed their gestures and faces. We found that both AA and EA participants exhibited more activity in lateral frontoparietal and visual regions when imitating AAs compared with EAs or CAs. These results suggest that racial self-similarity is not likely to modulate neural responses to race during imitation, in contrast with findings from previous neuroimaging studies of face perception and action observation. Furthermore, AA and EA participants associated AAs with lower social status than EAs or CAs, suggesting that the social status associated with different racial groups may instead modulate neural activity during imitation of individuals from those groups. Taken together, these findings suggest that neural responses to race during imitation are driven by socially learned associations rather than self-similarity. This may reflect the adaptive role of imitation in social learning, where learning from higher status models can be more beneficial. This study provides neural evidence consistent with evolutionary theories of cultural acquisition. Hum Brain Mapp 35:1723-1739, 2014. (c) 2013 Wiley-Periodicals, Inc.","[Losin, Elizabeth A.

Using the ultimatum game, several studies have demonstrated that the process of decision-making to cooperate or to defeat in interaction with a partner is associated with activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), anterior insula (AI), and inferior frontal cortex (IFC). This study investigates developmental changes in this neuronal network. Methods: 15 healthy children (8-12 years), 15 adolescents (13-18 years) and 15 young adults (19-28 years) were investigated using the ultimatum game. Neuronal networks representing decision-making based on strategic thinking were characterized using functional MRI. Results: In all age groups, the process of decision-making in reaction to unfair offers was associated with hemodynamic changes in similar regions. Compared with children, however, healthy adults and adolescents revealed greater activation in the IFC and the fusiform gyrus, as well as the nucleus accumbens. In contrast, healthy children displayed more activation in the AI, the dorsal part of the ACC, and the DLPFC. There were no differences in brain activations between adults and adolescents. Conclusion: The neuronal mechanisms underlying strategic social decision making are already developed by the age of eight. Decision-making based on strategic thinking is associated with age-dependent involvement of different brain regions. Neuronal networks underlying theory of mind and reward anticipation are more activated in adults and adolescents with regard to the increasing perspective taking with age. In relation to emotional reactivity and respective compensatory coping in younger ages, children have higher activations in a neuronal network associated with emotional processing and executive control.

However, it is still unclear whether the neural mechanisms underlying the moral judgment of pro-social lying differ from those underlying the moral judgment of anti-social lying. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the neural activities associated with moral judgment in anti- and pro-social lying. During fMRI scanning, subjects were provided with scenarios describing a protagonist's anti- and pro-social lying and were then asked to judge whether the protagonist's act was morally appropriate. The behavioral data showed that anti-social lying was mostly judged to be morally inappropriate and that pro-social lying was mainly judged to be morally appropriate. The functional imaging data revealed dissociable neural systems for moral judgment in anti- and pro-social lying. The anti-social lying, which was judged to be morally inappropriate, was associated with increased activity in the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex, right middle frontal gyrus, right precuneus/posterior cingulate gyms, left posterior cingulate gyms, and bilateral temporoparietal junction when compared with the control condition. The pro-social lying, which was judged to be morally appropriate, was associated with increased activity in the right middle temporal gyms, right supramarginal gyms, and the left middle cingulate gyrus when compared with the control condition. No overlapping activity was observed during the moral judgment of anti- and pro-social lying. Our data suggest that cognitive and neural processes for the moral judgment of lying are modulated by whether the lie serves to harm or benefit listeners. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we designed an artificial language (based on Korean Hangul) that can be read either through addressed (i.e., whole word mapping) or assembled (i.e., grapheme-to-phoneme mapping) phonology. Two matched groups of native English-speaking participants were trained in one of the two conditions, one hour per day for eight days. Behavioral results showed that both groups correctly named more than 90% of the trained words after training. At the neural level, we found a clear dissociation of the neural pathways for addressed and assembled phonologies: There was greater involvement of the anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, right orbital frontal cortex, angular gyrus and middle temporal gyrus for addressed phonology, but stronger activation in the left precentral gyrus/inferior frontal gyrus and supramarginal gyrus for assembled phonology. Furthermore, we found evidence supporting the strategy-shift hypothesis, which postulates that, with practice, reading strategy shifts from assembled to addressed phonology. Specifically, compared to untrained words, trained words in the assembled phonology group showed stronger activation in the addressed phonology network and less activation in the assembled phonology network.

Using fMRI, the current study examined the extent to which dispositions in justice sensitivity (i.e., how individuals react to experiences of injustice and unfairness) predict behavioral ratings of praise and blame and how they modulate the online neural response and functional connectivity when participants evaluate morally laden (good and bad) everyday actions. Justice sensitivity did not impact the neuro-hemodynamic response in the action-observation network but instead influenced higher-order computational nodes in the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ), right dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (rdlPFC, dmPFC) that process mental states understanding and maintain goal representations. Activity in these regions predicted praise and blame ratings. Further, the hemodynamic response in rTPJ showed a differentiation between good and bad actions 2 s before the response in rdlPFC. Evaluation of good actions was specifically associated with enhanced activity in dorsal striatum and increased the functional coupling between the rTPJ and the anterior cingulate cortex. Together, this study provides important knowledge in how individual differences in justice sensitivity impact neural computations that support psychological processes involved in moral judgment and mental-state reasoning.","[Yoder, Keith J.; Decety, Jean] Univ Chicago, Dept Psychol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Yoder, Keith J.; Decety, Jean] Univ Chicago, Ctr Cognit & Social Neurosci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Decety, Jean] Univ Chicago Med, Dept Psychiat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Decety, J (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Psychol, 5801 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.","decety@uchicago.edu","","","National Institute of Mental Health [1R01MH087525-01A2]; John Templeton Foundation (The Science of Philanthropy Initiative and Wisdom Research)","This study was supported by National Institute of Mental Health R01 Grant 1R01MH087525-01A2 and grants from the John Templeton Foundation (The Science of Philanthropy Initiative and Wisdom Research) to J.D.","","30","54","54","5","50","SOC NEUROSCIENCE","WASHINGTON","11 DUPONT CIRCLE, NW, STE 500, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0270-6474","","","J NEUROSCI","J.

We present the results of a human fMRI study that examines how neural activity relates to observed individual differences in the discounting of future rewards during an intertemporal monetary choice task. We found that a region of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dIPFC) BA-46 was more active in trials where subjects chose delayed rewards, after controlling for the subjective value of those rewards. We also found that the connectivity from dIPFC BA-46 to a region of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) widely associated with the computation of stimulus values, increased at the time of choice, and especially during trials in which subjects chose delayed rewards. Finally, we found that estimates of effective connectivity between these two regions played a critical role in predicting out-of-sample, between-subject differences in discount rates. Together with previous findings in dietary choice, these results suggest that a common set of computational and neurobiological mechanisms facilitate choices in favor of long-term reward in both settings.","[Hare, Todd A.] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Lab Social & Neural Syst Res, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Hare, Todd A.; Rangel, Antonio] CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Hakimi, Shabnam; Rangel, Antonio] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Hare, TA (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Blumlisalpstr 10, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.","todd.hare@econ.uzh.ch","Hare, Todd/E-7091-2017","Hare, Todd/0000-0002-0260-2772; Hakimi, Shabnam/0000-0003-4122-6041","National Science Foundation [0851408]","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation grant 0851408 to Antonio Rangel and Todd A.

However, the question still remains whether this increase in MPFC activation for in-group representation is solely related with previous experience with the in-group. To test this, we randomly assigned participants to a red or blue team and in a subsequent functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment they categorized red and blue team words as belonging to either the in-group or the out-group. Results showed that even under these minimal conditions increased activation was found in the MPFC when participants indicated that they belonged to a group, as compared with when they did not. This effect was found to be associated with the level of group identification.

The amount of mental effort investment that an individual experiences during task performance can be measured afterwards with the help of self-rating scales. Earlier research suggests that integration of information about somatic state changes is crucial for the self-evaluation of mental effort investment. Damage to the pathways which convey information about somatic state changes can lead to an inability to self-evaluate mental effort investment, while conceptually similar evaluations of task difficulty can still be performed. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate brain activation, while subjects rated their mental effort investment and the difficulty of a previously performed task. Our results show stronger activation of the left anterior insular cortex (aIC) during evaluation of mental effort. Additionally, the activity in left aIC during task performance was modulated by changes in task demand in a similar way as the self-ratings of mental effort. We argue that aIC does not only play a role in the integration of self-related information during self-evaluation of mental effort investment, but that left aIC might also be involved in the experience of mental effort during task performance.","[Otto, Tobias; Zijlstra, Fred R.

Research has already determined that avatar-based communication may increase perceived interpersonal trust in anonymous online environments. Despite this trust-inducing potential of avatars, however, we hypothesize that in trust situations, people will perceive human faces differently than they will perceive avatar faces. This prediction is based on evolution theory, because throughout human history the majority of interaction among people has taken place in face-to-face settings. Therefore, unlike perception of an avatar face, perception of a human face and the related trustworthiness discrimination abilities must be part of the genetic makeup of humans. Against this background, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment based on a multiround trust game to gain insight into the differences and similarities of interactions between humans versus human interaction with avatars. Our results indicate that (1) people are better able to predict the trustworthiness of humans than the trustworthiness of avatars; (2) decision making about whether or not to trust another actor activates the medial frontal cortex significantly more during interaction with humans, if compared to interaction with avatars; this brain area is of paramount importance for the prediction of other individuals' thoughts and intentions (mentalizing), a notably important ability in trust situations; and (3) the trustworthiness learning rate is similar, whether interacting with humans or avatars. Thus, the major implication of this study is that although interaction on the Internet may have benefits, the lack of real human faces in communication may serve to reduce these benefits, in turn leading to reduced levels of collaboration effectiveness.","[Riedl, Rene] Univ Appl Sci Upper Austria, Wels, Austria; [Riedl, Rene] Univ Linz, Linz, Austria; [Mohr, Peter N.

Using fMRI, we scanned participants while they studied and retrieved pictures of objects paired with one of three scenes (source) under self-reference and other-reference conditions. At the time of study, half of the items were presented once and half twice, allowing us to match behavioral performance between the groups. Both groups showed equivalent source accuracy benefits for objects encoded self-referentially. Activity in the left dorsal medial prefrontal cortex supported subsequent source memory in both age groups for the self-referenced relative to the other-referenced items. At the time of test, source accuracy for both the self- and other-referenced items was supported by a network of regions including the precuneus in both age groups. At both study and test, little in the way of age differences emerged, suggesting that when they are matched on behavioral performance, young and older adults engage similar regions in support of source memory when processing materials in reference to the self; however, when we did not match performance, age differences in functional recruitment were prevalent.

In just three decades, functional neuroimaging has been transformed from a crude clinical tool to a widely used research method for understanding the human brain and mind. Such rapidly achieved success is bound to evoke skepticism. A degree of skepticism toward new methods and ideas is both inevitable and useful in any field. It is especially valuable in a science as young as cognitive neuroscience and its even younger siblings, social and affective neuroscience. Healthy skepticism encourages us to check our assumptions, recognize the limitations of our methods, and proceed thoughtfully. Skepticism itself, however, also must be examined. In this article, I review the most commonly voiced criticisms of functional neuroimaging. In the spirit of healthy skepticism, I will critically examine these criticisms themselves. Each contains at least a kernel of truth, although I will argue that in some cases the kernel has been overextended in ways that are inaccurate or misleading.","","","","","","","","","64","17","17","0","34","WILEY-BLACKWELL","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0093-0334","1552-146X","","HASTINGS CENT REP","Hastings Cent.

Morality is made of rules and values that guide human behavior. They barely change among different cultures. Social accomplishments are the result of moral development, due to a taint of fairness which pervades any human activity. The moral functions are the consequence of evolution and have their own specific neural circuits. Aim. To describe their appearance, starting and underlying mechanisms in the normal brain. Development. Moral responses are basically homogeneous. They are linked to the emotional development, as much basic and individual (fear, wrath) as social (compassion, justice). Their emergence is the result of the emotional dichotomies pleasure/pain and reward/punishment, which lead to the basic moral dichotomy good/bad. For their working it is required the running of the prefrontal cortex (ventromedian and dorsolateral), the anterior cingular cortex and the superior temporal sulcus, that asses and elaborate and utilitarian moral response; and also the insula, the amygdale and the hypothalamus, that perform a quicker and emotionally rooted response. In addition, the mirror neuronal system (fronto-parietal) enables motor learning and empathy, linking this factor to the theory of mind. Conclusions. Moral sense and its responses underlay the complex social development that humans have reached and enjoyed. Thus opens ways for improving benefits in human groups and individuals alike. In addition, the knowledge of the normal function of the moral circuits is permeating and influencing the many areas of neuroculture.","[Alvaro-Gonzalez, Luis C.] Hosp Univ Basurto, Serv Neurol, E-48013 Bilbao, Vizcaya, Spain; [Alvaro-Gonzalez, Luis C.] Hosp Univ Basurto, Comite Bioet Asistencial, E-48013 Bilbao, Vizcaya, Spain; [Alvaro-Gonzalez, Luis C.] Univ Basque Country, Dept Neurociencias, Bilbao, Vizcaya, Spain","Alvaro-Gonzalez, LC (reprint author), Hosp Univ Basurto, Serv Neurol, Avda Montevideo 18, E-48013 Bilbao, Vizcaya, Spain.","luiscarlosalvaro@yahoo.es","","","","","","42","6","6","0","41","REVISTA DE NEUROLOGIA","BARCELONA","C/O CESAR VIGUERA, EDITOR, APDO 94121, 08080 BARCELONA, SPAIN","0210-0010","1576-6578","","REV NEUROLOGIA","Rev.

In particular, existing studies have not clearly dissociated the neural processes supporting short- and long-duration memories. The present study addressed this issue with functional MRI and a modified subsequent memory paradigm. Participants were asked to make semantic judgment on a list of 320 words in the scanner. Half of the words were tested after a short delay (i.e., 1 day, TI) and again after a long delay (i.e., 1 week, T12), whereas the other half were tested only once after the long delay (T2). Materials forgotten during T1 were categorized as forgotten trials, and those remembered during T2 were categorized as long-duration trials. In contrast, trials remembered during T1 but not during T12 were categorized as short-duration trials. We found that compared to forgotten trials, short-duration trials showed decreased activation in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus, which is consistent with many previous observations. Importantly, long-duration trials showed stronger activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) but less deactivation in the FCC relative to short-duration trials. Psychophysiological interactions (PPI) analysis revealed stronger functional connectivity between LIFG and PCC for long-duration trials than for forgotten trials. Our results suggest that strong PCC activity, in combination with strong LIFG activity, supports long-lasting memory. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

High-resolution structural T1-weighted MR images of 71 healthy young individuals were processed using voxel-based morphometric (VBM) approach. Multiple regression analyses were performed to identify the associations between personality traits and gray matter volume (GMV). The Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised, Short Scale for Chinese was chosen to assess the personality traits. This scale includes four dimensions, namely, extraversion, neuroticism, psychoticism, and lie. Particularly, we studied on two dimensions (extraversion and neuroticism) of Eysenck's personality. Our results showed that extraversion was negatively correlated with GMV of the bilateral amygdala, the bilateral parahippocampal gyrus, the right middle temporal gyrus, and the left superior frontal gyrus, all of which are involved in emotional and social cognitive processes. These results might suggest an association between extraversion and affective processing. In addition, a positive correlation was detected between neuroticism and GMV of the right cerebellum, a key brain region for negative affect coordination. Meanwhile, a negative association was revealed between GMV of the left superior frontal gyrus and neuroticism. These results may prove that neuroticism is related to several brain regions involved in regulating negative emotions. Based on those findings, we concluded that brain regions involved in social cognition and affective process accounted for modulation and shaping of personality traits among young individuals. Results of this study may serve as a basis for elucidating the anatomical factors of personality.","[Lu, Fengmei; Huo, Yajun; Li, Meiling; Chen, Heng; Liu, Feng; Wang, Yifeng; Long, Zhiliang; Duan, Xujun; Zhang, Jiang; Zeng, Ling; Chen, Huafu] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Neuroinformat, Chengdu 610054, Sichuan, Peoples R China","Chen, HF (reprint author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Neuroinformat, Chengdu 610054, Sichuan, Peoples R China.","chenhf@uestc.edu.cn","","","973 project [2012CB517901]; Natural Science Foundation of China [61035006, 61125304, 81171406, 61273361]; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China [20120185110028]; Key Technology R&D Program of Sichuan Province [2012SZ0159]","This work was supported by the 973 project 2012CB517901; and Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 61035006, 61125304, 81171406 and 61273361), and the Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (Grant No. 20120185110028), and the Key Technology R&D Program of Sichuan Province (Grant No. 2012SZ0159).

Although dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) activity may support source memory among young and older adults, the extent to which one activates dorsal vs. ventral mPFC may reflect one's personal connection with incoming information. Because truth value may be one salient marker that impacts one's connection with information and allocation of attention toward incoming material, we investigated whether the perceived truth value of information differently impacts differences in mPFC activity associated with encoding source information, particularly with age. Twelve young (18-23 years) and 12 older adults (63-80 years) encoded true and false statements. Behavioral results showed similar memory performance between the age groups. With respect to neural activity associated with subsequent memory, young adults, relative to older adults, exhibited greater activity in dmPFC while older adults displayed enhanced ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and insula engagement relative to young. These results may potentially indicate that young adults focus on a general knowledge acquisition goal, while older adults focus on emotionally relevant aspects of the material. The findings demonstrate that age-related differences in recruitment of mPFC associated with encoding source information may in some circumstances underlie age-equivalent behavioral performance.","[Cassidy, Brittany S.; Gutchess, Angela H.] Brandeis Univ, Dept Psychol, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Hedden, Trey] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Athinoula A Martinos Ctr Biomed Imaging, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Yoon, Carolyn] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","Cassidy, BS (reprint author), Brandeis Univ, Dept Psychol, 415 South St,MS 062, Waltham, MA 02454 USA.","bcassidy@brandeis.edu","","","NIGMS NIH HHS [T32 GM084907]; NIA NIH HHS [K01 AG040197]","","","65","5","5","0","8","FRONTIERS RESEARCH FOUNDATION","LAUSANNE","PO BOX 110, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND","1664-1078","","","FRONT PSYCHOL","Front.

However, the neural bases of receiving an apology and forgiveness are still unknown. Hence, the aim of the present fMRI study was to investigate brain processes involved in receiving an apology and active forgiveness of an ambiguous offense. We asked one group of participants ( player A) to make decisions, which were either positive or negative for another group of participants ( player B). The intention of player A was ambiguous to player B. In case of a negative impact, participants in the role of player A could send an apology message to participants in the role of player B. Subsequently players B were asked whether they wanted to forgive player A for making a decision with negative consequences. We found that receiving an apology yielded activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus, the left middle temporal gyrus, and left angular gyrus.

Furthermore, we report an unexpected main effect of increased left parietal cortex activation associated with suppressed fearful faces compared to suppressed houses.

Furthermore, a double dissociation showed that Catholics recruited different areas for deontological (precuneus; temporoparietal junction) and utilitarian moral judgments [dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC); temporal poles], whereas Atheists did not (superior parietal gyrus for both types of judgment). Finally, we tested how both groups responded to personal and impersonal moral dilemmas: Catholics showed enhanced activity in DLPFC and posterior cingulate cortex during utilitarian moral judgments to impersonal moral dilemmas and enhanced responses in anterior cingulate cortex and superior temporal sulcus during deontological moral judgments to personal moral dilemmas. Our results indicate that moral judgment can be influenced by an acquired set of norms and conventions transmitted through religious indoctrination and practice.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we tested whether urgency traits and mood induction affected medial prefrontal responses to alcohol odors (AcO). MethodsTwenty-seven social drinkers (mean age=25.2, 14 males) had 6 fMRI scans while viewing negative, neutral, or positive mood images (3 mood conditions) during intermittent exposure to AcO and appetitive control (AppCo) aromas. ResultsVoxel-wise analyses (p<0.001) confirmed [AcO>AppCo] activation throughout medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) regions. Extracted from a priori mPFC and vmPFC regions and analyzed in Odor (AcO, AppCo)xMood factorial models, AcO activation was greater than AppCo in left vmPFC (p<0.001), left mPFC (p=0.002), and right vmPFC (p=0.01) regions. Mood did not interact significantly with activation, but the covariate of trait negative urgency accounted for significant variance in left vmPFC (p=0.01) and right vmPFC (p=0.01) [AcO>AppCo] activation. Negative urgency also mediated the relationship between vmPFC activation and both (i) subjective craving and (ii) problematic drinking. ConclusionsThe trait of negative urgency is associated with neural responses to alcohol cues in the vmPFC, a region involved in reward value and emotion-guided decision-making. This suggests that negative urgency might alter subjective craving and brain regions involved in coding reward value.","[Cyders, Melissa A.; Coskunpinar, Ayca; Karyadi, Kenny] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Dzemidzic, Mario; Eiler, William J.; Kareken, David A.] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA","Cyders, MA (reprint author), Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Psychol, 402 N Blackford St LD 124, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.","mcyders@iupui.edu","","","NIAAA [K01AA020102]; Indiana Alcohol Research Center at Indiana University School of Medicine","Supported by K01AA020102 from NIAAA awarded to MAC and the Indiana Alcohol Research Center at Indiana University School of Medicine.

Twenty-two scientifically novice participants (humanities and arts college students) were asked, in an fMR1 study, whether or not they thought the light bulbs in images presenting electric circuits were lighted up correctly, and if they were certain or uncertain of their answers. When participants reported that they were unsure of their responses, analyses revealed significant activations in brain areas typically involved in uncertainty (anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula cortex, and superior/dorsomedial frontal cortex) and in the left middle/superior temporal lobe. Certainty was associated with large bilateral activations in the occipital and parietal regions usually involved in visuospatial processing. Correct-and-certain answers were associated with activations that suggest a stronger mobilization of visual attention resources when compared to incorrect-and-certain answers. These findings provide insights into brainbased mechanisms of uncertainty that are activated when common misconceptions, identified as such by science education research literature, interfere in decision making in a school-like task.

To study this we examined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) differences during an investment game where subjects received differentially credible investment advice. Participants (n = 42; 32 males) played an investment game, in which they could Buy or Not Buy a sequence of stocks. The better they did, the more money they made. Participants received either ""Expert'' advice or ""Peer'' advice. Those receiving Expert advice were told the advice came from a certified financial ""Expert''. Those receiving Peer Advice were told the advice was that of the student administering the scans, who deliberately dressed and acted casually. Both streams of advice were predetermined and identical. The advice was scripted to be helpful initially, but progressively worse as the task continued, becoming 100% wrong by the end of the task. Subjects receiving Expert Advice followed the advice significantly longer on average, even though this was progressively worse advice. Thus, following Expert advice had poorer consequences for individuals, but this did not dissuade them from continuing to follow the advice. In contrast, when subjects disobeyed Expert advice they exhibited significant anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and superior frontal gyrus activation relative to those disobeying Peer advice. These findings may suggest that in subjects who defy authority, or believe they are doing so (in this case by disobeying an ""Expert'') there is increased activation of these two brain regions. This may have relevance to several areas of behavior, and the potential role of these two brain regions in regard to disobedience behavior requires further study.","[Suen, Victoria Y.

However, little is known about the changes in local synchronization of spontaneous activity in patients with OSA. The primary aim of the present study was to investigate spontaneous brain activity in patients with OSA compared with good sleepers (GSs) using regional homogeneity (ReHo) analysis based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods: Twenty-five untreated male patients with severe OSA and 25 male GSs matched for age and years of education were included in this study. The ReHo method was calculated to assess the strength of local signal synchrony and was compared between the two groups. The observed mean ReHo values were entered into Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software to assess their correlation with behavioral performance. Results: Compared with GSs, patients with OSA showed significantly lower ReHo in the right medial frontal gyrus (BA11), right superior frontal gyrus (BA10), right cluster of the precuneus and angular gyrus (BA39), and left superior parietal lobule (BA7), and higher ReHo in the right posterior lobe of the cerebellum, right cingulate gyrus (BA23), and bilateral cluster covering the lentiform nucleus, putamen, and insula (BA13). The lower mean ReHo value in the right cluster of the precuneus and angular gyrus had a significant negative correlation with sleep time (r=-0.430, P=0.032), and higher ReHo in the right posterior lobe of the cerebellum showed a significant positive correlation with stage 3 sleep (r=0.458, P=0.021) and in the right cingulate gyrus showed a significant positive correlation with percent rapid eye movement sleep (r=0.405, P=0.045). Conclusion: Patients with OSA showed significant regional spontaneous activity deficits in default mode network areas. The ReHo method is a useful noninvasive imaging tool for detection of early changes in cerebral ReHo in patients with OSA.","[Peng, De-Chang; Dai, Xi-Jian; Gong, Hong-Han; Li, Hai-Jun; Nie, Xiao] Nanchang Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Radiol, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Dai, Xi-Jian] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Prince Wales Hosp, Dept Imaging & Intervent Radiol, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Wei] Nanchang Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Pneumol, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi, Peoples R China","Zhang, W (reprint author), Nanchang Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Pneumol, 17 Yong Wai Zheng St, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.","zhangweiliuxin@163.com","","DAI, Xi-jian/0000-0001-5328-6522","Jiangxi Provincial Department of Science and Technology Support Program [20132BBG70061, 20141BBG70026]; Jiangxi Provincial Department of Natural Science Foundation Project [20132BAB205100]; Jiangxi Provincial Department of Graduate Innovation Foundation [YC2013-S007]; Chinese Department of National Innovation Experiment Program for University Students [201210403052, 2012181]","The authors are grateful to the subjects who participated in this research.

These limitations stem from a focus on a single emotion per study, minimal variation in amount of social context provided, and lack of prosocial motivation assessment. In the current investigation, 32 participants completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging session assessing empathic responses to individuals experiencing painful, anxious, and happy events that varied in valence and amount of social context provided. They also completed a 14-day experience sampling survey that assessed real-world helping behaviors. The results demonstrate that empathy for positive and negative emotions selectively activates regions associated with positive and negative affect, respectively. In addition, the mirror system was more active during empathy for context-independent events (pain), whereas the mentalizing system was more active during empathy for context-dependent events (anxiety, happiness). Finally, the septal area, previously linked to prosocial motivation, was the only region that was commonly activated across empathy for pain, anxiety, and happiness. Septal activity during each of these empathic experiences was predictive of daily helping. These findings suggest that empathy has multiple input pathways, produces affect-congruent activations, and results in septally mediated prosocial motivation.","[Morelli, Sylvia A.; Rameson, Lian T.; Lieberman, Matthew D.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Morelli, SA (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Franz Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.","sylviamorelli@gmail.com","","Morelli, Sylvia/0000-0002-3353-678X","UCLA Brain Mapping Center; National Science Foundation IGERT Interdisciplinary Relationship Science Program at the University of California, Los Angeles","We are grateful to Naomi Eisenberger for her helpful feedback and Robert Spunt for his advice on statistical issues.

However, actual fMRI signals are nonlinear and do not automatically meet with the requirement of sICA. To provide a better solution to this problem, we proposed a novel approach termed instantaneous power based fMRI (ip-fMRI) for regularization of fMRI data. Given that the instantaneous power of fMRI signals is a scalar value, it should be a linear mixture that naturally satisfies the ""latent variables"" model. Based on our simulated data, the curves of accuracy and resulting receiver-operating characteristic curves indicate that the proposed approach is superior to the traditional fMRI in terms of accuracy and specificity by using sICA. Experimental results from human subjects have shown that spatial components of a hand movement task-induced activation reveal a brain network more specific to motor function by ip-fMRI than that by the traditional fMRI. We conclude that ICA decomposition of ip-fMRI may be used to localize energy signal changes in the brain and may have a potential to be applied to detection of brain activity.","[Zhong, Yuan] Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Psychol, Nanjing 210097, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Yuan; Zheng, Gang; Lu, Guangming] Nanjing Univ, Sch Med, Jinling Hosp, Dept Med Imaging, Nanjing 210002, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yijun] Univ Florida, McKnight Brain Inst, Dept Psychiat, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA; [Liu, Yijun] Univ Florida, McKnight Brain Inst, Dept Neurosci, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA","Lu, GM (reprint author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Med, Jinling Hosp, Dept Med Imaging, Nanjing 210002, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.","cjr.luguangming@vip.163.com","","","Natural Scientific Foundation of China [81201077, 81101039]; MOE (Ministry of Education in China) [11YJC190039]; Natural Science Foundation of the Higher Education Institutions of Jiangsu Province, China [12kjb310002]; Chinese Key Grant for GML [BWS11J063, 10z026]","This work was supported by grants from the Natural Scientific Foundation of China (Grant no. 81201077 to Yuan Zhong and 81101039 to Gang Zheng), the MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences (Grant no. 11YJC190039 to Yuan Zhong), the Natural Science Foundation of the Higher Education Institutions of Jiangsu Province, China (Grant no. 12kjb310002 to Yuan Zhong), and a Chinese Key Grant for GML (Grant nos.

However, the nature of the STS preference for these 'social stimuli' remains unclear, as does the location within the STS for specific types of information processing. The aim of this study was to directly examine properties of the STS in terms of selective response to social stimuli. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to scan participants whilst they were presented with auditory, visual, or audiovisual stimuli of people or objects, with the intention of localising areas preferring both faces and voices (i.e., 'people-selective' regions) and audiovisual regions designed to specifically integrate person-related information. Results highlighted a 'people-selective, heteromodal' region in the trunk of the right STS which was activated by both faces and voices, and a restricted portion of the right posterior STS (pSTS) with an integrative preference for information from people, as compared to objects. These results point towards the dedicated role of the STS as a 'social-information processing' centre. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR) is working to address this challenge and establish test-retest reliability as a minimum standard for methods development in functional connectomics. Specifically, CoRR has aggregated 1,629 typical individuals' resting state fMRI (rfMRI) data (5,093 rfMRI scans) from 18 international sites, and is openly sharing them via the International Data-sharing Neuroimaging Initiative (INDI). To allow researchers to generate various estimates of reliability and reproducibility, a variety of data acquisition procedures and experimental designs are included. Similarly, to enable users to assess the impact of commonly encountered artifacts (for example, motion) on characterizations of inter-individual variation, datasets of varying quality are included.","[Zuo, Xi-Nian; Dong, Hao-Ming; Fu, Xiaolan; He, Ye; Hou, Xiao-Hui; Jiang, Yi; Li, Hui-Jie; Liu, Xun; Nan, Weizhi; Wang, Kai; Wei, Gao-Xia; Xu, Ting; Yang, Ning; Yang, Zhi; Zhang, Lei; Zhang, Zhe; Zhao, Ke; Zhou, Yuan; Zhu, Xing-Ting] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Psychol, Key Lab Behav Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zuo, Xi-Nian; Dong, Hao-Ming; Fu, Xiaolan; He, Ye; Hou, Xiao-Hui; Jiang, Yi; Li, Hui-Jie; Liu, Xun; Nan, Weizhi; Wang, Kai; Wei, Gao-Xia; Xu, Ting; Yang, Ning; Yang, Zhi; Zhang, Lei; Zhang, Zhe; Zhao, Ke; Zhou, Yuan; Zhu, Xing-Ting] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Psychol, Magnet Resonance Imaging Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zuo, Xi-Nian; Chen, Antao; Chen, Jiangtao; Chen, Xu; Lei, Xu; Liu, Yijun; Qiu, Jiang; Wei, Dongtao; Zhang, Qinglin] Southwest Univ, Fac Psychol, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China; [Anderson, Jeffrey S.; Nielsen, Jared A.] Univ Utah, Div Neuroradiol, Salt Lake City, UT 84132 USA; [Bellec, Pierre] Univ Montreal, Unite Neuroimagerie Fonct, Ctr Rech, Inst Univ Geriatrie Montreal, Montreal, PQ H3W 1W5, Canada; [Birn, Rasmus M.; Lainhart, Janet E.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychiat, Madison, WI 53719 USA; [Biswal, Bharat B.] New Jersey Inst Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Blautzik, Janusch; Meindl, Thomas] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Inst Clin Radiol, D-80336 Munich, Germany; [Breitner, John C.

Because of the sensitiveness to the phase shift and length of time courses of the BOLD recordings, region of interest based conventional correlation and coherence methods are no longer suitable for rs-fMRI analyses. In this paper, we propose a more robust and consistent method, dominant frequency mapping, to analyze rs-fMRI data. We found a dominant frequency of BOLD recordings, 0.0137Hz, in resting human brains that is consistent across participants and brain regions. This frequency is detected mainly in Gyrus Rectus, Frontal Medial Orbital, Frontal Superior Orbital and Olfactory Sulcus, which control the human social behavior, emotion, and decision making. In the meantime, we found that BOLD frequencies are most inconsistent in the brain regions of PrecentralGyrus, Superior Frontal gyrus, Insula, Caudate nucleus, Putamen, and part of the cerebellum, whose functions are about motor.","[He, Lianghua] Tongji Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Embedded Syst & Serv Comp, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [He, Lianghua] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Software Engn, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Hu, Die] Fudan Univ, Dept Commun Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Wan, Meng] Minist Educ, Ctr Sci & Technol Dev, Beijing 10080, Peoples R China; [Wen, Ying] E China Normal Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China","Hu, D (reprint author), Fudan Univ, Dept Commun Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.","hudie@fudan.edu.cn","","","","","","13","4","5","1","26","IOS PRESS","AMSTERDAM","NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0959-2989","1878-3619","","BIO-MED MATER ENG","Bio-Med.

Results showed that participants changed their choices when these choices conflicted with the normative opinion of the group they were members of, especially in conditions of unfair treatment. The fMRI data revealed that a conflict with group norms activated the brain regions involved in norm violations and behavioral adjustment. Furthermore, in the reject-unfair condition, we observed that a conflict with group norms activated the medial frontal gyrus.

Behaviorally, we find a model-based algorithm characterized subject predictions better than several alternative models. Notably, when the agent's prediction was concordant rather than discordant with the subject's own likely prediction, participants credited people more than algorithms for correct predictions and penalized them less for incorrect predictions. Neurally, many components of the mentalizing network medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, temporoparietal junction, and precuneus represented or updated expertise beliefs about both people and algorithms. Moreover, activity in lateral orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal cortex reflected behavioral differences in learning about people and algorithms.

We have previously demonstrated enhanced fMRI activation in experts in the motor components of an action observation network (AON) during sports anticipation tasks. Soccer players often need to prevent opponents from successfully predicting their line of attack, and consequently may try to deceive them; for example, by performing a step-over. We examined how AON activations and expertise effects are modified by the presence of deception. Three groups of participants; higher-skilled males, lower-skilled males, and lower-skilled females, viewed video clips in point-light format, from a defender's perspective, of a player approaching and turning with the ball. The observer's task in the scanner was to determine whether the move was normal or deceptive (involving a step-over), while whole-brain functional images were acquired. In a second counterbalanced block with identical stimuli the task was to predict the direction of the ball. Activations of AON for identification of deception overlapped with activations from the direction identification task. Higher-skilled players showed significantly greater activation than lower-skilled players in a subset of AON areas; and lower-skilled males in turn showed greater activation than lower-skilled females, but females showed more activation in visual cortex. Activation was greater for deception identification than for direction identification in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, medial frontal cortex, anterior insula, cingulate gyrus, and premotor cortex. Conversely, greater activation for direction than deception identification was found in anterior cingulate cortex and caudate nucleus. Results are consistent with the view that explicit identification of deceptive moves entails cognitive effort and also activates limbic structures associated with social cognition and affective responses.","[Wright, Michael J.; Bishop, Daniel T.] Brunel Univ, Dept Psychol, Ctr Cognit & Neuroimaging, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Bishop, Daniel T.; Jackson, Robin C.] Brunel Univ, Ctr Sports Med & Human Performance, Sch Sport Sci & Educ, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Abernethy, Bruce] Univ Queensland, Fac Hlth Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Abernethy, Bruce] Univ Hong Kong, Inst Human Performance, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Wright, MJ (reprint author), Brunel Univ, Dept Psychol, Ctr Cognit & Neuroimaging, Kingston Lane, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.","michael.wright@brunel.ac.uk","","Jackson, Robin/0000-0001-7983-3870; Wright, Michael/0000-0001-8969-6830","Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China [HKU 7400/05H]","Supported by the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.

In the present study, we examined the brain correlates of forgiveness using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Healthy participants were induced to imagine social scenarios that described emotionally hurtful events followed by the indication to either forgive the imagined offenders, or harbor a grudge toward them. Subjects rated their imaginative skills, levels of anger, frustration, and/or relief when imagining negative events as well as following forgiveness. Forgiveness was associated with positive emotional states as compared to unforgiveness. Granting forgiveness was associated with activations in a brain network involved in theory of mind, empathy, and the regulation of affect through cognition, which comprised the precuneus, right inferior parietal regions, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Our results uncovered the neuronal basis of reappraisal-driven forgiveness, and extend extant data on emotional regulation to the resolution of anger and resentment following negative interpersonal events.","[Ricciardi, Emiliano; Rota, Giuseppina; Sani, Lorenzo; Gaglianese, Anna; Pietrini, Pietro] Univ Pisa, Lab Clin Biochem & Mol Biol, Dept Surg Med Mol & Crit Area Pathol, I-56126 Pisa, Italy; [Ricciardi, Emiliano; Sani, Lorenzo; Gentili, Claudio] CNR, Fdn G Monasterio Reg Toscana, MRI Lab, I-56100 Pisa, Italy; [Gentili, Claudio; Guazzelli, Mario; Pietrini, Pietro] Pisa Univ Hosp, Clin Psychol Branch, Pisa, Italy","Pietrini, P (reprint author), Univ Pisa, Clin Psychol Branch, Sch Med, Via Roma 67, I-56126 Pisa, Italy.","pietro.pietrini@med.unipi.it","Ricciardi, Emiliano/E-6929-2011","Ricciardi, Emiliano/0000-0002-7178-9534; Gentili, Claudio/0000-0002-2579-8755; Gaglianese, Anna/0000-0002-3660-8654; Pietrini, Pietro/0000-0002-6768-5556","Campaign for Forgiveness Research, John Templeton Foundation, U.S.A [CFR-5130]","Supported by the Campaign for Forgiveness Research, John Templeton Foundation (CFR-5130 grant to Pietro Pietrini), U.S.A.

Experiencing humor not only encourages social interactions, but also produces positive physiological effects on the human body, such as lowering blood pressure. Recent neuro-imaging studies have shown evidence for distinct mental state changes at work in people experiencing humor. However, the temporal characteristics of these changes remain elusive. In this paper, we objectively measured humor-related mental states from single-trial functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data obtained while subjects viewed comedy TV programs. Measured fMRI data were labeled on the basis of the lag before or after the viewer's perception of humor (humor onset) determined by the viewer-reported humor experiences during the fMRI scans. We trained multiple binary classifiers, or decoders, to distinguish between fMRI data obtained at each lag from ones obtained during a neutral state in which subjects were not experiencing humor. As a result, in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the right temporal area, the decoders showed significant classification accuracies even at two seconds ahead of the humor onsets. Furthermore, given a time series of fMRI data obtained during movie viewing, we found that the decoders with significant performance were also able to predict the upcoming humor events on a volume-by-volume basis. Taking into account the hemodynamic delay, our results suggest that the upcoming humor events are encoded in specific brain areas up to about five seconds before the awareness of experiencing humor. Our results provide evidence that there exists a mental state lasting for a few seconds before actual humor perception, as if a viewer is expecting the future humorous events.","[Sawahata, Yasuhito; Komine, Kazuteru; Morita, Toshiya; Hiruma, Nobuyuki] NHK Japan Broadcasting Corp, Sci & Tech Res Labs, Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 157, Japan","Sawahata, Y (reprint author), NHK Japan Broadcasting Corp, Sci & Tech Res Labs, Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 157, Japan.","sawahata.y-jq@nhk.or.jp","","","","","","34","4","4","2","19","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","SAN FRANCISCO","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","1932-6203","","","PLOS ONE","PLoS One","DEC 4","2013","8","12","","","","","","","e81009","10.1371/journal.pone.0081009","","","","9","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science & Technology - Other Topics","265KD","WOS:000327949300065","24324656","DOAJ Gold, Green Published","","","2019-02-21","searchterm","searchterm_records_3001-3500.txt"

Moreover, these differences were mainly due to the amount and pervasiveness of category information linguistically embedded in the everyday names of the items in the respective languages, with important differences across languages in how pervasive category labels are embedded in item-level terms. Nonetheless, the left inferior frontal gyrus and the bilateral medial frontal gyrus are the most consistent neural correlates of category typicality that persist across languages and linguistic cues.

We reveal a neural mechanism for UT in decision making using blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants (N = 33) encoded information on a set of consumer products (e.g. 48 attributes describing four different cars), and we manipulated whether participants (i) consciously thought about this information (conscious thought), (ii) completed a difficult 2-back working memory task (UT) or (iii) made an immediate decision about the consumer products (ID) in a within-subjects blocked design. To differentiate UT neural activity from 2-back working memory neural activity, participants completed an independent 2-back task and this neural activity was subtracted from neural activity occurring during the UT 2-back task. Consistent with a neural reactivation account, we found that the same regions activated during the encoding of complex decision information (right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left intermediate visual cortex) continued to be activated during a subsequent 2-min UT period. Moreover, neural reactivation in these regions was predictive of subsequent behavioral decision-making performance after the UT period.

Two well-investigated emotion-regulation strategies (ERSs), cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, are associated with overlapping prefrontal neural correlates, but differ temporally during the emotion-generation process. Although functional imaging studies have mainly investigated these ERS as a reaction to an emotion-inducing event, the intention to regulate upcoming negative emotions might already be associated with differences in neural activity. Hence, event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging was recorded in 42 participants while they completed an emotion-regulation paradigm. During this task, participants were instructed to proactively prepare to use a specific ERS knowing that a negative, high-arousing image would appear after the preparation period. As expected, the results demonstrated prefrontal and parietal activation while participants were suppressing or reappraising their emotions (family-wise error (FWE)-corrected). The intention to suppress emotions was associated with increased activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral putamen, pre-supplementary motor area and right supramarginal gyrus (FWE-corrected). This enhanced proactive inhibitory control: (i) predicted decreased motoric activity during the actual suppression of emotional expressions and (2) trended toward a significant association with how successfully participants suppressed their emotions. However, neural correlates of preparatory control for cognitive reappraisal were not observed, possibly because contextual cues about the upcoming emotional stimulus are necessary to proactively start to cognitively reinterpret the situation.","[Vanderhasselt, Marie-Anne; Kuehn, Simone; De Raedt, Rudi] Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Clin & Hlth Psychol, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Kuehn, Simone] Charite, Clin Psychiat & Psychotherapy, D-13353 Berlin, Germany","Vanderhasselt, MA (reprint author), Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Clin & Hlth Psychol, Henri Dunantlaan 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.","MarieAnne.Vanderhasselt@Ugent.be","De Raedt, Rudi/A-3269-2012; Kuhn, Simone/P-6145-2014","De Raedt, Rudi/0000-0001-6781-4808; "," [FWO08/PDO/168];  [BOF10/GOA/014]","M.A.V.

Although several regions commonly observed in social tasks have been shown to be involved in imitation control, there is little work exploring how these regions interact with one another. We used tMRI and dynamic causal modeling to identify imitation-specific control mechanisms and examine functional interactions between regions. Participants performed a pre-specified action (lifting their index or middle finger) in response to videos depicting the same two actions (biological cues) or dots moving with similar trajectories (non-biological cues). On congruent trials, the stimulus and response were similar (e.g. index finger response to index finger or left side dot stimulus), while on incongruent trials the stimulus and response were dissimilar (e.g. index finger response to middle finger or right side dot stimulus). Reaction times were slower on incongruent compared to congruent trials for both biological and non-biological stimuli, replicating previous findings that suggest the automatic imitative or spatially compatible (congruent) response must be controlled on incongruent trials. Neural correlates of the congruency effects were different depending on the cue type. The medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, inferior frontal gyrus pars opercularis (IFGpo) and the left anterior insula were involved specifically in controlling imitation. In addition, the IFGpo was also more active for biological compared to non-biological stimuli, suggesting that the region represents the frontal node of the human mirror neuron system (MNS). Effective connectivity analysis exploring the interactions between these regions, suggests a role for the mPFC and ACC in imitative conflict detection and the anterior insula in conflict resolution processes, which may occur through interactions with the frontal node of the MNS. We suggest an extension of the previous models of imitation control involving interactions between imitation-specific and general cognitive control mechanisms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The present research addresses this question by combining recent neuroscientific insights with ecologically meaningful behavioral methods. Participants formed impressions of real people whom they met in a personally involving situation. fMRI and supporting behavioral data revealed that outcome dependency (i.e., depending on another person for a desired outcome) alters previously identified neural dynamics of impression formation. Consistent with past research, a functional localizer identified a region of dorsomedial PFC previously linked to social impression formation. In the main task, this ROI revealed the predicted patterns of activity across outcome dependency conditions: greater BOLD response when information confirmed (vs. violated) social expectations if participants were outcome-independent and the reverse pattern if participants were outcome-dependent. We suggest that, although social perceivers often discount expectancy-disconfirming information as noise, being dependent on another person for a desired outcome focuses impression-formation processing on the most diagnostic information, rather than on the most tractable information.

Since connectivity between distant brain regions strengthens during childhood, it is unclear when in the course of development this relationship emerges. Thus, the goal of this study was to determine whether parietal-frontal functional connectivity is associated with intelligence in young children. We performed independent component analyses on resting-state fMRI data of 115 children (6-8 years old) to select seed and target regions for a seed/target region correlation analysis. We found that higher nonverbal intelligence was associated with increased functional connectivity between right parietal and right frontal regions, and between right parietal and dorsal anterior cingulate regions. The association between intelligence and functional connectivity between certain brain regions was stronger in girls than boys.

In order to determine the effects of alphabetic and nonalphabetic writing systems, the current study examined the influence of learning to read on oral language in English and Chinese speakers. Children (8-12 years olds) and adults made rhyming judgments to pairs of spoken words during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Developmental increases were seen only for English speakers in the left hemisphere phonological network (superior temporal gyrus (STG), inferior parietal lobule, and inferior frontal gyrus). The increase in the STG was more pronounced for words with conflicting orthography (e.g. pint-mint; jazz-has) even though access to orthography was irrelevant to the task. Moreover, higher reading skill was correlated with greater activation in the STG only for English speaking children. The effects suggest that learning to read reorganizes the phonological awareness network only for alphabetic and not logographic writing systems because of differences in the principles for mapping between orthographic and phonological representations. The reorganization of the auditory cortex may result in better phonological awareness skills in alphabetic readers. Hum Brain Mapp 34:3354-3368, 2013.

The ageing process brings changes in both perceptual and motor abilities, yet little is known about how these changes may affect the ability to accurately interpret other people's actions. Here we investigated the effect of ageing on the ability to discriminate the weight of objects based on the movements of actors lifting these objects. Stimuli consisted of videos of an actor lifting a small box weighing 0.05-0.9 kg or a large box weighting 3-18 kg. In a four-alternative forced-choice task, younger and older participants reported the perceived weight of the box in each video. Overall, older participants were less sensitive than younger participants in discriminating the perceived weight of lifted boxes, an effect that was especially pronounced in the small box condition. Weight discrimination performance was better for the large box compared to the small box in both groups, due to greater saliency of the visual cues in this condition. These results suggest that older adults may require more salient visual cues to interpret the actions of others accurately. We discuss the potential contribution of age-related changes in visual and motor function on the observed effects and suggest that older adults' decline in the sensitivity to subtle visual cues may lead to greater reliance on visual analysis of the observed scene and its semantic context.","[Maguinness, Corrina] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Sch Psychol, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Maguinness, Corrina; Roudaia, Eugenie; Kenny, Rose Anne] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Inst Neurosci, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Setti, Annalisa; Kenny, Rose Anne] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Irish Longitudinal Study Ageing, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Setti, Annalisa] Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Sch Appl Psychol, Cork, Ireland","Setti, A (reprint author), Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Sch Psychol, Irish Longitudinal Study Ageing, Dublin 2, Ireland.","asetti@tcd.ie","","Roudaia, Eugenie/0000-0002-1901-9719; Setti, Annalisa/0000-0002-9741-2559; Maguinness, Corrina/0000-0002-6200-4109","Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA)","We would like to thank Simone Schutz-Bosbach for providing us with the videos used in the present work.

In this fMRI study, adolescents (N = 27, 14 male, 14-17 years-old) completed a series of tasks in the scanner assessing risky decision-making before and after an episode of social exclusion. In this particular context, exclusion was associated with greater behavioral risk-taking among adolescents with low self-reported resistance to peer influence (RN). When making risky decisions after social exclusion, adolescents who had lower RPI exhibited higher levels of activity in the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ), and this response in rTPJ was a significant mediator of the relationship between RPI and greater risk-taking after social exclusion. Lower RPI was also associated with lower levels of activity in IPFC during crashes following social exclusion, but unlike rTPJ this response in IPFC was not a significant mediator of the relationship between RPI and greater risk-taking after social exclusion. The results suggest that mentalizing and/or attentional mechanisms have a unique direct effect on adolescents' vulnerability to peer influence on risk-taking. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Although direct comparisons demonstrated advantages concerning blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal response and spatial specificity, these mostly focused on single brain regions with rather simple tasks. Considering that physiological noise also increases with higher field strength, it is not entirely clear whether the advantages of 7 T translate equally to the entire brain during tasks which elicit more complex neuronal processing. Therefore, we investigated the difference between 3 T and 7 Tin response to transcutaneous electrical painful and non-painful stimulation in 22 healthy subjects. For painful stimuli vs. baseline, stronger activations were observed at 7 Tin several brain regions including the insula and supplementary motor area, but not the secondary somatosensory cortex (p < 0.05 FWE-corrected). Contrasting painful vs. non-painful stimulation limited the differences between the field strengths to the periaqueductal gray (PAG, p < 0.001 uncorrected) due to a similar signal increase at 7 T for both the target and specific control condition in most brain regions. This regional specificity obtained for the PAG at higher field strengths was confirmed by an additional spatial normalization strategy optimized for the brainstem. Here, robust BOLD responses were obtained in the dorsal PAG at 7 T (p < 0.05 FWE-corrected), whereas at 3 T activation was completely missing for the contrast against non-painful stimuli. To summarize, our findings support previously reported benefits obtained at ultra-high field strengths also for complex activation patterns elicited by painful electrical stimulation. However, this advantage depends on the region and even more on the contrast of interest The greatest gain at 7 T was observed within the small brainstem region of the PAG, where the increased field strength offered marked improvement for the localization of activation foci with high spatial specificity.

Specifically, we compared brain activation for visual-perspective taking to activation for false belief reasoning, which requires awareness of perspective to understand someone's mistaken belief about the world which contrasts with reality. In support of a previous account by Perner and Leekam (2008), our meta-analytic conjunction analysis found common activation for false belief reasoning and visual perspective taking in the left but not the right dorsal temporo-parietal junction (TPJ). This fits with the idea that the left dorsal TPJ is responsible for representing different perspectives in a domain-general fashion. Moreover, our conjunction analysis found activation in the precuneus and the left middle occipital gyrus close to the putative Extrastriate Body Area (EBA). The precuneus is linked to mental-imagery which may aid in the construction of a different perspective. The EBA may be engaged due to imagined body-transformations when another's viewpoint is adopted.","[Schurz, Matthias; Aichhorn, Markus; Martin, Anna; Perner, Josef] Salzburg Univ, Ctr Neurocognit Res, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria; [Schurz, Matthias; Aichhorn, Markus; Martin, Anna; Perner, Josef] Salzburg Univ, Dept Psychol, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria","Schurz, M (reprint author), Salzburg Univ, Ctr Neurocognit Res, Hellbrunnerstr 34, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria.","matthias.schurz@sbg.ac.at","Cognitive Neuroscience, Centre for/C-7888-2011","","","","","99","46","46","1","52","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","1662-5161","","","FRONT HUM NEUROSCI","Front.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a paradigm in which an adaptive pacing signal simulates a virtual partner, we examined the neural substrates underlying dynamic joint action. A single parameter controlled the degree to which the virtual partner adapted its behavior in relation to participant taps, thus simulating varying degrees of cooperativity. Analyses of fMRI data using objective and subjective measures of synchronization quality found the relative balance of activity in two distinct neural networks to depend on the degree of the virtual partners adaptivity. At lower degrees of adaptivity, when the virtual partner was easier to synchronize with, cortical midline structures were activated in conjunction with premotor areas, suggesting a link between the action and socio-affective components of cooperation. By contrast, right lateral prefrontal areas associated with central executive control processes were recruited during more cognitively challenging interactions while synchronizing with an overly adaptive virtual partner. Together, the reduced adaptive sensorimotor synchronization paradigm and pattern of results illuminate neural mechanisms that may underlie the socio-emotional consequences of different degrees of entrainment success.","[Fairhurst, Merle T.; Keller, Peter E.] Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Leipzig, Germany; [Janata, Petr] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Psychol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Janata, Petr] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Mind & Brain, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Keller, Peter E.] Univ Western Sydney, MARCS Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Fairhurst, MT (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Leipzig, Germany.","fairhurst@cbs.mpg.de","","Keller, Peter/0000-0001-7579-6515","Max Planck Society; Metanexus Institute","This research was supported by the Max Planck Society.

Studies on neural correlates of music-evoked fear are scant, and there are only a few studies on neural correlates of joy in general. Eighteen individuals listened to excerpts of fear-evoking, joy-evoking, as well as neutral music and rated their own emotional state in terms of valence, arousal, fear, and joy. Results show that BOLD signal intensity increased during joy, and decreased during fear (compared to the neutral condition) in bilateral auditory cortex (AC) and bilateral superficial amygdala (SF). In the right primary somatosensory cortex (area 3b) BOLD signals increased during exposure to fear-evoking music. While emotion-specific activity in AC increased with increasing duration of each trial, SF responded phasically in the beginning of the stimulus, and then SF activity declined. Psychophysiological Interaction (PPI) analysis revealed extensive emotion-specific functional connectivity of AC with insula, cingulate cortex, as well as with visual, and parietal attentional structures. These findings show that the auditory cortex functions as a central hub of an affective-attentional network that is more extensive than previously believed. PPI analyses also showed functional connectivity of SF with AC during the joy condition, taken to reflect that SF is sensitive to social signals with positive valence. During fear music, SF showed functional connectivity with visual cortex and area 7 of the superior parietal lobule, taken to reflect increased visual alertness and an involuntary shift of attention during the perception of auditory signals of danger.

Inference of finding implicated meanings is based on the listener's assumption that the conversational partner says only relevant matters according to the maxim of relevance in Grice's theory of conversational implicature. To investigate the neural correlates of comprehending implicated meanings under the maxim of relevance, a total of 23 participants underwent an fMRI task with a series of conversational pairs, each consisting of a question and an answer. The experimental paradigm was composed of three conditions: explicit answers, moderately implicit answers, and highly implicit answers. Participants were asked to decide whether the answer to the Yes/No question meant 'Yes' or 'No'. Longer reaction time was required for the highly implicit answers than for the moderately implicit answers without affecting the accuracy. The fMRI results show that the left anterior temporal lobe, left angular gyrus, and left posterior middle temporal gyrus had stronger activation in both moderately and highly implicit conditions than in the explicit condition. Comprehension of highly implicit answers had increased activations in additional regions including the left inferior frontal gyrus, left medial prefrontal cortex, left posterior cingulate cortex and right anterior temporal lobe. The activation results indicate involvement of these regions in the inference process to build coherence between literally irrelevant but pragmatically associated utterances under the maxim of relevance. Especially, the left anterior temporal lobe showed high sensitivity to the level of implicitness and showed increased activation for highly versus moderately implicit conditions, which imply its central role in inference such as semantic integration. The right hemisphere activation, uniquely found in the anterior temporal lobe for highly implicit utterances, suggests its competence for integrating distant concepts in implied utterances under the relevance principle.

The ventral temporal fusiform face area showed sensitivity to fearful expressions in static faces. However, for dynamic faces, we found fear sensitivity in dorsal motion-sensitive areas within hMT+/V5 and superior temporal sulcus. The model with the greatest evidence included connections modulated by dynamic and static fear from amygdala to dorsal and ventral temporal areas, respectively.

While social bonds are built through sharing the plight and pain of others in the name of empathy, viewing a hateful person in pain also has many potential ramifications. In this functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study, Caucasian Jewish male participants viewed videos of (1) disliked, hateful, anti-Semitic individuals, and (2) liked, non-hateful, tolerant individuals in pain. The results showed that, compared with viewing liked people, viewing hateful people in pain elicited increased responses in regions associated with observation of physical pain (the insular cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the somatosensory cortex), reward processing (the striatum), and frontal regions associated with emotion regulation. Functional connectivity analyses revealed connections between seed regions in the left ACC and right insular cortex with reward regions, the amygdala, and frontal regions associated with emotion regulation. These data indicate that regions of the brain active while viewing someone in pain may be more active in response to the danger or threat posed by witnessing the pain of a hateful individual more so than the desire to empathize with a likable person's pain.","[Fox, Glenn R.; Sobhani, Mona; Aziz-Zadeh, Lisa] Univ So Calif, Grad Program Neurosci, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Fox, Glenn R.; Sobhani, Mona; Aziz-Zadeh, Lisa] Brain & Creat Inst, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Aziz-Zadeh, Lisa] Div Occupat Sci & Occupat Therapy, Los Angeles, CA USA","Fox, GR (reprint author), Univ So Calif, Brain & Creat Inst, 3620A McClintock Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.","glennfox@usc.edu","","","","","","65","11","11","1","15","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","PO BOX 110, EPFL INNOVATION PARK, BUILDING I, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND","1664-1078","","","FRONT PSYCHOL","Front.

Notably, PEs at different hierarchical levels may be encoded by different neuromodulatory transmitters. Here, we tested this possibility in computational fMRI studies of audio-visual learning. Using a hierarchical Bayesian model, we found that low-level PEs about visual stimulus outcome were reflected by widespread activity in visual and supra-modal areas but also in the midbrain. In contrast, high-level PEs about stimulus probabilities were encoded by the basal forebrain. These findings were replicated in two groups of healthy volunteers. While our fMRI measures do not reveal the exact neuron types activated in midbrain and basal forebrain, they suggest a dichotomy between neuromodulatory systems, linking dopamine to low-level PEs about stimulus outcome and acetylcholine to more abstract PEs about stimulus probabilities.","[Iglesias, Sandra; Mathys, Christoph; Brodersen, Kay H.; Kasper, Lars; Stephan, Klaas E.] Univ Zurich, Inst Biomed Engn, TNU, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Iglesias, Sandra; Mathys, Christoph; Brodersen, Kay H.; Kasper, Lars; Stephan, Klaas E.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Iglesias, Sandra; Mathys, Christoph; Brodersen, Kay H.; Kasper, Lars; Piccirelli, Marco; Stephan, Klaas E.] Univ Zurich, Lab Social & Neural Syst Res SNS, CH-8091 Zurich, Switzerland; [den Ouden, Hanneke E.

This functional MRI study investigated how brain activation related to two components of reward processing (Reward Anticipation and Reward Outcome) changes with age in a sample of 39 children, adolescents and young adults aged 10-25. Our data revealed age-related changes in brain activity during both components of reward processing. Activation related to Reward Anticipation increased with age, while activation related to Reward Outcome decreased in various regions of the reward network. This shift from outcome to anticipation was confirmed by subsequent analyses showing positive correlations between age and the difference in activation between Reward Anticipation and Reward Outcome. The shift was predominantly present in striatal regions and was accompanied by a significant effect of age on behaviour, with older participants showing more response speeding on potentially rewarding trials than younger participants. This study provides evidence for functional changes in the reward system which may underlie typical adolescent behaviour. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In prior work, where aesthetic preference is quantified using visual conjoint methods, aesthetic preference and functional preference were handled separately. Here, we introduce a new methodology, metaconjoint analysis, for testing the hypothesis that when consumers make decisions taking into account both a product's form and its function they employ a more complex decision-making strategy than when basing their decisions on form or function alone. We anticipate that this strategy will involve both analytical and emotional processes. When compared with participant ratings of form and function combinations across 28 subjects, the metaconjoint model is shown to have a correlation that was not statistically different from an additive model of form and function. However, unlike the additive model, the metaconjoint model gave additional information about how participants make tradeoffs between form and function. Next, we developed a novel paradigm using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine what parts of the brain are primarily involved with a given tradeoff between form and function. While in the scanner, study participants were asked to make decisions in trials where only form varied, where only function varied, and where both form and function varied. Results from 14 participants suggest that choices based on products that vary in both form and function involve some unique and some common brain networks as compared to choices based on form or function alone; notably, emotion-related regions are activated during these complex decisions where form and function are in conflict. These results are consistent with the inclusion of emotion in decision-making with regards to product choice and demonstrate the feasibility of using fMRI to address questions about the mental processes underlying consumer decisions. Studying preference decisions together with their accompanying neurological activity will give engineers and designers greater insight into the consumer decision-making process.","[Sylcott, Brian; Cagan, Jonathan] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Tabibnia, Golnaz] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Social & Decis Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Sylcott, B (reprint author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.","sylcott@alumni.cmu.edu; cagan@cmu.edu; tabibnia@uci.edu","","Sylcott, Brian/0000-0002-4225-2105","National Science Foundation [SBE0738058]; Pittsburgh Life Sciences Greenhouse","The authors would like to thank the National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship program and grant (SBE0738058) and Pittsburgh Life Sciences Greenhouse for funding this research.

To explore this principle, we examined the cognitive process relational complexity (RC), defined as the number of visual dimensions considered during problem solving on a matrix reasoning task and a well-documented measure of mature reasoning capacity. We sought to determine how the visual environment influences RC by examining the influence of color and visual contrast on RC in a neuroimaging task. To specify the contributions of sensory demand and relational integration to reasoning, our participants performed a non-verbal matrix task comprised of color, no-color line, or black-white visual contrast conditions parametrically varied by complexity (relations 0, 1, 2). The use of matrix reasoning is ecologically valid for its psychometric relevance and for its potential to link the processing of psychophysically specific visual properties with various levels of RC during reasoning. The role of these elements is important because matrix tests assess intellectual aptitude based on these seemingly context-less exercises. This experiment is a first step toward examining the psychophysical underpinnings of performance on these types of problems. The importance of this is increased in light of recent evidence that intelligence can be linked to visual discrimination. We submit three main findings. First, color and black-white visual contrast (BWVC) add demand at a basic sensory level, but contributions from color and from BWVC are dissociable in cortex such that color engages a ""reasoning heuristic"" and BWVC engages a ""sensory heuristic."" Second, color supports contextual sense-making by boosting salience resulting in faster problem solving. Lastly, when visual complexity reaches 2-relations, color and visual contrast relinquish salience to other dimensions of problem solving.","[Kalbfleisch, M.

During scanning, 17 younger and 16 older adults judged whether words stereotypical of aging and control words described them. Judging stereotype words versus control words revealed higher activations in posterior midline regions associated with self-referencing, including the precuneus, for older adults compared to younger adults. While heightening salience of stereotypes can evoke a threat response, detrimentally affecting performance, invoking stereotypes canal so lead to a phenomenon called resilience, where older adults use those stereotypes to create downward social comparisons to ""other"" older adults and elevate their own self-perception. In an exploration of brain regions underlying stereotype threat responses as well as resilience responses, we found significant activation in older adults for threat over resilient responses in posterior midline regions including the precuneus, associated with self-reflective thought, and parahippocampal gyrus, implicated in autobiographical memory. These findings have implications for understanding how aging stereotypes may affect the engagement of regions associated with contextual and social processing of self-relevant information, indicating ways in which stereotype threat can affect the engagement of neural resources with age.","[Colton, Gabriel; Leshikar, Eric D.; Gutchess, Angela H.] Brandeis Univ, Dept Psychol, Waltham, MA 02453 USA","Gutchess, AH (reprint author), Brandeis Univ, Dept Psychol, 415 South St, Waltham, MA 02453 USA.","gutchess@brandeis.edu","","","National Institute on Aging [R21 AG032382]; National Institutes on Health [T90 DA032435-02, T32 AG000204-21]; Biomedical Technology Program of the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), National Institutes of Health [P41RR14075]","This work was supported by the National Institute on Aging grant R21 AG032382 (to Angela H.

This has been shown for judgement of faces, architecture, artworks and body movements. In contrast, other evidence suggests that this relationship can also work in the inverse direction, at least in the domain of watching dance. Specifically, it has been shown that in certain contexts, people derive greater pleasure from watching unfamiliar movements they would not be able to physically reproduce compared to simpler, familiar actions they could physically reproduce. It remains unknown, however, how different kinds of experience with complex actions, such as dance, might change observers' affective judgements of these movements. Our aim was to clarify the relationship between experience and affective evaluation of whole body movements. In a between-subjects design, participants received either physical dance training with a video game system, visual and auditory experience or auditory experience only. Participants' aesthetic preferences for dance stimuli were measured before and after the training sessions. Results show that participants from the physical training group not only improved their physical performance of the dance sequences, but also reported higher enjoyment and interest in the stimuli after training. This suggests that physically learning particular movements leads to greater enjoyment while observing them. These effects are not simply due to increased familiarity with audio or visual elements of the stimuli, as the other two training groups showed no increase in aesthetic ratings post-training. We suggest these results support an embodied simulation account of aesthetics, and discuss how the present findings contribute to a better understanding of the shaping of preferences by sensorimotor experience.","[Kirsch, Louise P.; Cross, Emily S.] Bangor Univ, Sch Psychol, Wales Inst Cognit Neurosci, Bangor LL57 2AS, Gwynedd, Wales; [Drommelschmidt, Kim A.; Cross, Emily S.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, Inst Behav Sci, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands","Cross, ES (reprint author), Bangor Univ, Sch Psychol, Wales Inst Cognit Neurosci, Bangor LL57 2AS, Gwynedd, Wales.","e.cross@bangor.ac.uk","","Kirsch, Louise/0000-0002-8418-776X","Bangor University; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research [NWO Veni 451-11-002]; Economic and Social Research Council [F003639]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K001892/1]","The authors would like to thank Nadine Diersch, Richard Ramsey, and Alison J.

Here, we present the first investigation of the neural mechanisms underlying aversive Pavlovian-instrumental transfer using fMRI in humans. Recent evidence indicates that these Pavlovian influences on instrumental actions are action-specific: Instrumental approach is invigorated by appetitive Pavlovian cues but inhibited by aversive Pavlovian cues. Conversely, instrumental withdrawal is inhibited by appetitive Pavlovian cues but invigorated by aversive Pavlovian cues. We show that BOLD responses in the amygdala and the nucleus accumbens were associated with behavioral inhibition by aversive Pavlovian cues, irrespective of action context. Furthermore, BOLD responses in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex differed between approach and withdrawal actions. Aversive Pavlovian conditioned stimuli modulated connectivity between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the caudate nucleus. These results show that actionspecific aversive control of instrumental behavior involves the modulation of fronto-striatal interactions by Pavlovian conditioned stimuli.","[Geurts, Dirk E.

As facial expressions widely differ in their duration and degree of expressiveness, they often manifest with short and transient expressions below the level of awareness. In this combined behavioral and fMRI study, we aimed at examining whether or not consciously accessible (subliminal) emotional facial expressions influence empathic judgments and which brain activations are related to it. We hypothesized that subliminal facial expressions of emotions masked with neutral expressions of the same faces induce an empathic processing similar to consciously accessible (supraliminal) facial expressions. Our behavioral data in 23 healthy subjects showed that subliminal emotional facial expressions of 40 ms duration affect the judgments of the subsequent neutral facial expressions. In the fMRI study in 12 healthy subjects it was found that both, supra- and subliminal emotional facial expressions shared a widespread network of brain areas including the fusiform gyrus, the temporo-parietal junction, and the inferior, dorsolateral, and medial frontal cortex. Compared with subliminal facial expressions, supraliminal facial expressions led to a greater activation of left occipital and fusiform face areas. We conclude that masked subliminal emotional information is suited to trigger processing in brain areas which have been implicated in empathy and, thereby in social encounters","[Prochnow, D.; Kossack, H.; Brunheim, S.; Mueller, K.; Seitz, R.

Emotion work illustrates selective mPFC response dependent on valence, such that negative emotional images evoke increased ventral mPFC activity for younger adults, while older adults recruit vmPFC more for positive material. By testing whether this differential age-related response toward valenced material is also present for the social task of forming impressions, we may begin to understand inconsistencies regarding when age differences are present vs. absent in the literature. Using fMRI, participants intentionally formed impressions of positive and negative face-behavior pairs in anticipation of a memory task. Extending previous findings to a social task, valence-based reversals were present in dorsal and ventral mPFC, and posterior cingulate cortex. Younger adults elicited increased activity when forming negative impressions, while older adults had more recruitment when forming positive impressions. This suggests an age-related shift toward emphasizing positive social information may be reflected in the recruitment of regions supporting forming impressions. Overall, the results indicate an age-related shift in neural response to socio-cognitive stimuli that is valence dependent rather than a general age-related reduction in activity, in part informing prior inconsistencies within the literature.","[Cassidy, Brittany S.; Leshikar, Eric D.; Shih, Joanne Y.; Aizenman, Avigael; Gutchess, Angela H.] Brandeis Univ, Waltham, MA 02454 USA","Cassidy, BS (reprint author), Brandeis Univ, 415 South St,MS 062, Waltham, MA 02454 USA.","bcassidy@brandeis.edu","","","National Institute on Aging [R21 AG032382]; National Science Foundation graduate fellowship; National Institutes on Health [T32 AG000204-21]; Biomedical Technology Program of the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), National Institutes of Health","This work was supported by the National Institute on Aging grant [R21 AG032382] (to A.

Currently, there are two empirical research disciplines tackling human volition: cognitive neuroscience and social psychology. To date, there is little interaction between the two disciplines in terms of the investigation of human volition. The aim of the current article is to highlight recent brain imaging work on human volition and to relate social psychological concepts of volition to the functional neuroanatomy of intentional action. A host of studies indicate that the medial prefrontal cortex plays a crucial role in voluntary action. Accordingly, we postulate that social psychological concepts of volition can be investigated using neuroimaging techniques, and propose that by developing a social cognitive neuroscience of human volition, we may gain a deeper understanding of this fascinating and complex aspect of the human mind.","[Brass, Marcel; Lynn, Margaret T.; Demanet, Jelle; Rigoni, Davide] Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Psychol, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Brass, Marcel] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Behav Sci, Nijmegen, Netherlands","Brass, M (reprint author), Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Psychol, Henri Dunantlaan 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.","marcel.brass@ugent.be","Lynn, Margaret/O-8723-2016","Lynn, Margaret/0000-0003-2741-2067; Brass, Marcel/0000-0002-3364-4019; Rigoni, Davide/0000-0001-9045-3190","","","","117","28","29","3","58","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","0014-4819","1432-1106","","EXP BRAIN RES","Exp.

Studying the brain processes that underlie such in-group biases is important for a wider understanding of the potential influence of social factors on basic perceptual processes. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how people perceive the actions of in-group and out-group members, and how their biased view in favor of own team members manifests itself in the brain. We divided participants into two teams and had them judge the relative speeds of hand actions performed by an in-group and an out-group member in a competitive situation. Participants judged hand actions performed by in-group members as being faster than those of out-group members, even when the two actions were performed at physically identical speeds. In an additional fMRI experiment, we showed that, contrary to common belief, such skewed impressions arise from a subtle bias in perception and associated brain activity rather than decision-making processes, and that this bias develops rapidly and involuntarily as a consequence of group affiliation. Our findings suggest that the neural mechanisms that underlie human perception are shaped by social context. Hum Brain Mapp 34:2055-2068, 2013.

To identify the specific neural circuits involved in the perception of violent videos, forty-nine male participants were scanned with functional MRI while watching video-clips depicting Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) and Capoeira as a baseline. Prior to scanning, a self-report measure of pleasure or displeasure when watching MMA was collected. Watching MMA was associated with activation of the anterior insula (AI), brainstem, ventral tegmental area (VTA), striatum, medial, and lateral prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, somatosensory cortex, and supramarginal gyrus. While this pattern of brain activation was not related to participants' reported experience of pleasure or displeasure, pleasurable ratings of MMA predicted increased functional connectivity (FC) seeded in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) (a structure known to be responsive to anticipating both positive and negative outcomes) with the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insular cortex (AIC) (regions involved in positive feelings and visceral somatic representations). Displeasure ratings of MMA were related to increased FC with regions of the prefrontal cortex and superior parietal lobule, structures implicated in cognitive control and executive attention. These data suggest that functional connectivity is an effective approach to investigate the relationship between subjective feelings of pleasure and pain of neural structures known to respond to both the anticipation of positive and negative outcomes.","[Porges, Eric C.; Decety, Jean] Univ Chicago, Dept Psychol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Porges, EC (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Psychol, 5848 S Univ Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.","eporges@uchicago.edu","","","National Science Foundation [BCS-0718480]; NIH/NIMH [MH84934-01A1]","This study was supported by a grant (# BCS-0718480) from the National Science Foundation and a grant from NIH/NIMH (# MH84934-01A1) to Dr. Jean Decety.

Digital and social media text is conversational text that fulfills the phatic needs of typical social interaction: 'keeping in touch' does not in any way constitute a cultural regression but represents the fundamental ground of human cognition, which is inescapably both social and technologically dependent. An analysis of examples from the popular microblogging service Twitter serves to illustrate the gestural functions of digital media text, including the enactment of mediated social 'spaces'. The closing section explores the theoretical implications for identity and agency of connecting embodied nonverbal communication to digital media communication that is all too often erroneously understood to be or implicitly approached as 'disembodied'.","[Schandorf, Michael] Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60607 USA","Schandorf, M (reprint author), Univ Illinois, Dept Commun MC132, 1007 West Harrison St,1140 BSB, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.","mschandorf@yahoo.com","","","","","","108","8","8","0","10","SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","THOUSAND OAKS","2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","1354-8565","1748-7382","","CONVERGENCE-US","Convergence","AUG","2013","19","3","","","","","319","344","","10.1177/1354856512439501","","","","26","Communication","Communication","AJ4VX","WOS:000337677900008","","","","","2019-02-21","searchterm","searchterm_records_3501-4000.txt"

Results demonstrate that participants displayed meaningful subjective stress responses, as well as significant increases in salivary alpha-amylase and cortisol levels.

Moreover, previous research has shown that affective judgments are mediated by the task they have to perform. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging in 21 healthy participants, we focus this study on the cerebral activity patterns triggered by neutral and emotional faces in two different tasks (social or gender judgments). Results obtained, using conjunction analyses, indicated that viewing both emotional and neutral faces evokes activity in several similar brain areas indicating a common neural substrate. Moreover, neutral faces specifically elicit activation of cerebellum, frontal and temporal areas, while emotional faces involve the cuneus, anterior cingulated gyrus, medial orbitofrontal cortex, posterior superior temporal gyrus, precentral/postcentral gyrus and insula. The task selected was also found to influence brain activity, in that the social task recruited frontal areas while the gender task involved the posterior cingulated, inferior parietal lobule and middle temporal gyrus to a greater extent. Specifically, in the social task viewing neutral faces was associated with longer reaction times and increased activity of left dorsolateral frontal cortex compared with viewing facial expressions of emotions. In contrast, in the same task emotional expressions distinctively activated the left amygdale. The results are discussed taking into consideration the fact that, like other facial expressions, neutral expressions are usually assigned some emotional significance. However, neutral faces evoke a greater activation of circuits probably involved in more elaborate cognitive processing.","[Carvajal, Fernando; Rubio, Sandra; Serrano, Juan M.; Pacheco, Lara; Martin, Pilar] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Dept Biol Psychol & Hlth, Fac Psicol, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Rios-Lago, Marcos] UNED, Fac Psicol, Dept Psicol Basica 2, Madrid, Spain; [Rios-Lago, Marcos; Alvarez-Linera, Juan] Fdn Reina Sofia, UIPA, Fdn CIEN, Madrid, Spain; [Alvarez-Linera, Juan] Hosp Ruber Int, Secc Neurorradiol, Madrid 28034, Spain","Carvajal, F (reprint author), Autonomous Univ Madrid, Dept Biol Psychol & Hlth, Fac Psicol, Ciudad Univ Cantoblanco S-N, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.","fernando.carvajal@uam.es; sandra.rubio@uam.es; juanmanuel.serrano@uam.es; mrios@psi.uned.es; jalinera@ruberinternacional.es; lara.pacheco@estudiante.uam.es; pilar.martin@uam.es","Rios-Lago, Marcos/C-9568-2012; Serrano, Juan Manuel/B-7149-2011","Rios-Lago, Marcos/0000-0003-0187-5047; Serrano, Juan Manuel/0000-0002-0708-568X","Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia, Spain [MICINN-PSI-2009-09067]","This research was supported by a grant from Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia, Spain (MICINN-PSI-2009-09067).","","70","12","12","0","16","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","0014-4819","","","EXP BRAIN RES","Exp.

Assessing the utility of a classifier in application domains such as cognitive neuroscience, brain-computer interfaces, or clinical diagnostics necessitates inference on classification performance at more than one level, i.e., both in individual subjects and in the population from which these subjects were sampled. Such inference requires models that explicitly account for both fixed-effects (within-subjects) and random-effects (between-subjects) variance components. While models of this sort are standard in mass-univariate analyses of fMRI data, they have not yet received much attention in multivariate classification studies of neuroimaging data, presumably because of the high computational costs they entail. This paper extends a recently developed hierarchical model for mixed-effects inference in multivariate classification studies and introduces an efficient variational Bayes approach to inference. Using both synthetic and empirical fMRI data, we show that this approach is equally simple to use as, yet more powerful than, a conventional t-test on subject-specific sample accuracies, and computationally much more efficient than previous sampling algorithms and permutation tests. Our approach is independent of the type of underlying classifier and thus widely applicable. The present framework may help establish mixed-effects inference as a future standard for classification group analyses. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In our first experiment we used self-specific stimuli comprised of the subjects own name and non-self-specific stimuli comprised of a friends name and an unknown name, presented during EO versus EC baselines in a 3 name condition x 2 baseline design. In Experiment 2 we directly measured spontaneous activity in the absence of stimuli during EO versus EC to confirm a modulatory effect of the two baseline conditions in the regions found to show an interaction effect in Experiment 1. Spontaneous activity during EO was significantly higher than during EC in bilateral auditory cortex and non-self-specific names yielded stronger signal changes relative to EO baseline than to EC. In contrast, there was no difference in response to self-specific names relative to EO baseline than to EC despite the difference between spontaneous activity levels.

However, most of these studies used fewer than 40 participants. Methodology: After extracting data (number of subjects, condition studied, number of foci identified and threshold) from 94 brain fMRI meta-analyses (k = 1,788 unique datasets) published through December of 2011, we analyzed the correlation between individual study sample sizes and number of significant foci reported. We also performed an analysis where we evaluated each meta-analysis to test whether there was a correlation between the sample size of the meta-analysis and the number of foci that it had identified. Correlation coefficients were then combined across all meta-analyses to obtain a summary correlation coefficient with a fixed effects model and we combine correlation coefficients, using a Fisher's z transformation. Principal Findings: There was no correlation between sample size and the number of foci reported in single studies (r = 0.0050) but there was a strong correlation between sample size and number of foci in meta-analyses (r = 0.62, p<0.001). Only studies with sample sizes <45 identified larger (>40) numbers of foci and claimed as many discovered foci as studies with sample sizes >= 45, whereas meta-analyses yielded a limited number of foci relative to the yield that would be anticipated from smaller single studies. Conclusions: These results are consistent with possible reporting biases affecting small fMRI studies and suggest the need to promote standardized large-scale evidence in this field. It may also be that small studies may be analyzed and reported in ways that may generate a larger number of claimed foci or that small fMRI studies with inconclusive, null, or not very promising results may not be published at all.","[David, Sean P.; Chu, Isabella M.; Loftus, Pooja D.] Stanford Univ, Dept Med, Sch Med, Div Gen Med Disciplines, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [David, Sean P.] SRI Int, Ctr Hlth Sci, Policy Div, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [David, Sean P.; Ware, Jennifer J.; Munafo, Marcus R.] Univ Bristol, Dept Expt Psychol, Bristol, Avon, England; [Ware, Jennifer J.] Cardiff Univ, Inst Psychol Med & Clin Neurosci, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Fusar-Poli, Paolo; Radua, Joaquim] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat, Dept Psychosis Studies, London, England; [Fusar-Poli, Paolo; Radua, Joaquim] South London & Maudsley NHS Fdn Trust, OASIS Team, London, England; [Ioannidis, John P.

But willpower can be disrupted by emotions and depleted over time. Luckily, humans can deploy alternative self-control strategies like precommitment, the voluntary restriction of access to temptations. Here, we examined the neural mechanisms of willpower and precommitment using fMRI. Behaviorally, precommitment facilitated choices for large delayed rewards, relative to willpower, especially in more impulsive individuals. While willpower was associated with activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and inferior frontal gyrus, precommitment engaged lateral frontopolar cortex (LFPC). During precommitment, LFPC showed increased functional connectivity with DLPFC and PPC, especially in more impulsive individuals, and the relationship between impulsivity and LFPC connectivity was mediated by value-related activation in ventromedial PFC. Our findings support a hierarchical model of self-control in which LFPC orchestrates precommitment by controlling action plans in more caudal prefrontal regions as a function of expected value.","[Crockett, Molly J.; Clark, Luke; Robbins, Trevor W.] Univ Cambridge, Behav & Clin Neurosci Inst, Cambridge CB1 3EB, England; [Crockett, Molly J.; Clark, Luke; Robbins, Trevor W.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Psychol, Cambridge CB1 3EB, England; [Crockett, Molly J.; Tobler, Philippe N.] Univ Zurich, Lab Social & Neural Syst Res, Dept Econ, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Crockett, Molly J.] UCL, Wellcome Trust Ctr Neuroimaging, London WC1N 3BG, England; [Braams, Barbara R.] Leiden Univ, Inst Psychol, NL-2311 EZ Leiden, Netherlands; [Kalenscher, Tobias] Univ Dusseldorf, Inst Expt Psychol, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany; [Kalenscher, Tobias] Univ Amsterdam, Swammerdam Inst Life Sci, NL-1098 XH Amsterdam, Netherlands","Crockett, MJ (reprint author), Univ Cambridge, Behav & Clin Neurosci Inst, Cambridge CB1 3EB, England.","molly.crockett@ucl.ac.uk","Crockett, Molly/F-8217-2014","Crockett, Molly/0000-0001-8800-410X; Clark, Luke/0000-0003-1103-2422; Tobler, Philippe/0000-0002-4915-9448; Robbins, Trevor/0000-0003-0642-5977","Sir Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral Fellowship; VENI grant from the Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NWO) [016.081.144]; Amsterdam graduate school for the neurosciences (ONWA); University Research Fellowship of the Royal Society [UF080591]; Swiss National Science Foundation [PP00P1_128574, CRSII3_141965]; Medical Research Council [G00001354]; Wellcome Trust [G00001354]; Medical Research Council [G1000183, G0001354B, G1000183B, G0001354]","M.J.C. is supported by the Sir Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral Fellowship.

Reinforcement learning theories formalize this map as a set of stochastic relationships between actions and states, such that for any given action considered in a current state, a probability distribution is specified over possible outcome states. Here, we show that activity in the human inferior parietal lobule correlates with the divergence of such outcome distributions-a measure that reflects whether discrimination between alternative actions increases the controllability of the future-and, further, that this effect is dissociable from those of other information theoretic and motivational variables, such as outcome entropy, action values, and outcome utilities.

One of the most consistent findings has been that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC) is activated when people contemplate various aspects of themselves and their life, such their traits, experiences, preferences, abilities, and goals. Recent evidence suggests that this region may not support the act of self-reflection per se, but its precise function in self-processing remains unclear. In this article, I examine the hypothesis that the vMPFC may contribute to assign personal value or significance to self-related contents: stimuli and mental representations that refer or relate to the self tend to be assigned unique value or significance, and the function of the vMPFC may precisely be to evaluate or represent such significance. Although relatively few studies to date have directly tested this hypothesis, several lines of evidence converge to suggest that vMPFC activity during self-processing depends on the personal significance of self-related contents. First, increasing psychological distance from self-representations leads to decreased activation in the vMPFC. Second, the magnitude of vMPFC activation increases linearly with the personal importance attributed to self-representations. Third, the activity of the vMPFC is modulated by individual differences in the interest placed on self-reflection. Finally, the evidence shows that the vMPFC responds to outer aspects of self that have high personal value, such as possessions and close others. By assigning personal value to self-related contents, the vMPFC may play an important role in the construction, stabilization, and modification of self-representations, and ultimately in guiding our choices and decisions.","[D'Argembeau, Arnaud] Univ Liege, Dept Psychol Cognit & Behav, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [D'Argembeau, Arnaud] Univ Liege, Cyclotron Res Ctr, B-4000 Liege, Belgium","D'Argembeau, A (reprint author), Univ Liege, Dept Psychol Cognit & Behav, Blvd Rectorat 3 B33, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.","a.dargembeau@ulg.ac.be","","D'Argembeau, Arnaud/0000-0003-3618-9768","","","","163","65","65","3","59","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","1662-5161","","","FRONT HUM NEUROSCI","Front.

According to one account, the rTPJ initiates a ""circuit-breaking"" signal that interrupts ongoing attentional processes, effectively reorienting attention. It is argued this primary function of the rTPJ has been extended beyond attention, through a process of evolutionarily cooption, to play a role in social cognition. We propose an alternative account, according to which the capacity for social cognition depends on a network which is both distinct from and in tension with brain areas involved in focused attention and target detection: the default mode network (DMN). Theory characterizing the rTPJ based on the area's purported role in reorienting may be falsely guided by the co-occurrence of two distinct effects in contiguous regions: activation of the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), associated with its functional role in target detection; and the transient release, during spatial reorienting, of suppression of the angular gyrus (AG) associated with focused attention. Findings based on meta-analysis and resting functional connectivity are presented which support this alternative account. We find distinct regions, possessing anti-correlated patterns of resting connectivity, associated with social reasoning (AG) and target detection (SMG) at the rTPJ. The locus for reorienting was spatially intermediate between the AG and SMG and showed a pattern of connectivity with similarities to social reasoning and target detection seeds. These findings highlight a general methodological concern for brain imaging. Given evidence that certain tasks not only activate some areas but also suppress activity in other areas, it is suggested that researchers need to distinguish two distinct putative mechanisms, either of which may produce an increase in activity in a brain area: functional engagement in the task vs. release of suppression.","[Kubit, Benjamin] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Psychol, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Jack, Anthony I.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Brain Mind & Consciousness Lab, Dept Cognit Sci, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Jack, AI (reprint author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Brain Mind & Consciousness Lab, Dept Cognit Sci, Crawford 617 E,10900 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.","tony.jack@gmail.com","Jack, Anthony/A-8929-2008","Jack, Anthony/0000-0001-9613-3964","Leonard Krieger Fund; University Hospitals Case Medical Center Spitz Brain Health fund","The authors would like to thank Brian Hysell and Scott Tillem for help with the meta-analysis; Kevin Barry and Avi Snyder for help with the connectivity analysis; and Karl Friston, Joy Geng Emiliano Macaluso, Avi Snyder, and two anonymous reviewers for comments on earlier versions of the manuscript.

Such effects of stress may depend on processes that are engaged during resting-state, through active recollection of past experiences and anticipation of future events, all known to involve the default mode network (DMN). By inducing social stress and acquiring resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before stress, immediately following it, and 2 h later, we expanded the time-window for examining the trajectory of the stress response. Throughout the study repeated cortisol samplings and self-reports of stress levels were obtained from 51 healthy young males. Post-stress alterations were investigated by whole brain resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of two central hubs of the DMN: the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and hippocampus. Results indicate a 'recovery' pattern of DMN connectivity, in which all alterations, ascribed to the intervening stress, returned to pre-stress levels. The only exception to this pattern was a stress-induced rise in amygdala-hippocampal connectivity, which was sustained for as long as 2 h following stress induction. Furthermore, this sustained enhancement of limbic connectivity was inversely correlated to individual stress-induced cortisol responsiveness (AUCi) and characterized only the group lacking such increased cortisol (i.e., non-responders). Our observations provide evidence of a prolonged post-stress response profile, characterized by both the comprehensive balance of most DMN functional connections and the distinct time and cortisol dependent ascent of intra-limbic connectivity. These novel insights into neuro-endocrine relations are another milestone in the ongoing search for individual markers in stress-related psychopathologies.","[Vaisvaser, Sharon; Lin, Tamar; Podlipsky, Ilana; Hendler, Talma] Sourasky Med Ctr, Wohl Inst Adv Imaging, Funct Brain Ctr, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Vaisvaser, Sharon; Greenman, Yona; Stern, Naftali; Hendler, Talma] Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Fac Med, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Vaisvaser, Sharon; Tarrasch, Ricardo; Bar-Haim, Yair; Hendler, Talma] Tel Aviv Univ, Sagol Sch Neurosci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Lin, Tamar; Wald, Ilan; Bar-Haim, Yair; Hendler, Talma] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Psychol Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Admon, Roee] Harvard Univ, McLean Hosp, Sch Med, Ctr Depress Anxiety & Stress Res, Belmont, MA USA; [Greenman, Yona; Stern, Naftali] Sourasky Med Ctr, Inst Endocrinol Metab & Hypertens, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Fruchter, Eyal] IDF, Med Corps, Div Mental Hlth, Tel Hashomer, Israel; [Pine, Daniel S.] NIMH, Sect Dev & Affect Neurosci, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Tarrasch, Ricardo] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Educ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Hendler, T (reprint author), Tel Sourasky Med Ctr, Wohl Inst Adv Imaging, 6 Weizman St, IL-64239 Tel Aviv, Israel.","ysharonv@gmail.com; talma@tasmc.health.gov.il","","Vaisvaser, Sharon/0000-0003-0156-2243; Tarrasch, Ricardo/0000-0003-1677-6615; Bar-Haim, Yair/0000-0002-4630-9180","U.S. Department of Defense [W81XWH-11-2-0008]; Israel Ministry of Defense; Tel-Aviv University; I-CORE Program of the Planning and Budgeting Committee; Israel Science Foundation [51/11]","This research was supported by the U.S. Department of Defense award number W81XWH-11-2-0008, Israel Ministry of Defense, Tel-Aviv University, and the I-CORE Program of the Planning and Budgeting Committee and The Israel Science Foundation (Grant No. 51/11).

Coaching and mentoring to the Positive Emotional Attractor (PEA) emphasizes compassion for the individual's hopes and dreams and has been shown to enhance a behavioral change. In contrast, coaching to the Negative Emotional Attractor (NEA), by focusing on externally defined criteria for success and the individual's weaknesses in relation to them, does not show sustained change. We used fMRI to measure BOLD responses associated with these two coaching styles. We hypothesized that PEA coaching would be associated with increased global visual processing and with engagement of the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), while the NEA coaching would involve greater engagement of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Regions showing more activity in PEA conditions included the lateral occipital cortex, superior temporal cortex, medial parietal, subgenual cingulate, nucleus accumbens, and left lateral prefrontal cortex. We relate these activations to visioning, PNS activity, and positive affect. Regions showing more activity in NEA conditions included medial prefrontal regions and right lateral prefrontal cortex.

The aim of this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was to investigate if COC use would induce more pronounced mood symptoms than placebo in women with previous history of COC-induced adverse mood. A second aim was to determine if COC use is associated with changes in brain reactivity in regions previously associated with emotion processing. Methods: Thirty-four women with previous experience of mood deterioration during COC use were randomized to one treatment cycle with a levonorgestrel-containing COC or placebo. An emotional face matching task (vs. geometrical shapes) was administered during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) prior to and during the COC treatment cycle. Throughout the trial, women recorded daily symptom ratings on the Cyclicity Diagnoser (CD) scale. Results: During the last week of the treatment cycle COC users had higher scores of depressed mood, mood swings, and fatigue than placebo users. COC users also had lower emotion-induced reactivity in the left insula, left middle frontal gyrus, and bilateral inferior frontal gyri as compared to placebo users. In comparison with their pretreatment cycle, the COC group had decreased emotion-induced reactivity in the bilateral inferior frontal gyri, whereas placebo users had decreased reactivity in the right amygdala. Conclusion: COC use in women who previously had experienced emotional side effects resulted in mood deterioration, and COC use was also accompanied by changes in emotional brain reactivity. These findings are of relevance for the understanding of how combined oral contraceptives may influence mood. Placebo-controlled fMRI studies in COC sensitive women could be of relevance for future testing of adverse mood effects in new oral contraceptives. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, this review has not yet been examined in logographic scripts such as Chinese, in which action verbs can provide explicit linguistic cues to the effectors (arm, leg, mouth) that conduct the action (hit, jump, drink). We compared the somatotopic representation of Chinese verbs that contain such effector cues and those that do not. The results showed that uncued verbs elicited similar somatotopic representation in the motor and premotor cortex as found in alphabetic scripts. However, effector-cued verbs demonstrated an inverse somatotopic pattern by showing reduced activation in corresponding motor areas, despite that effector-cued verbs actually are rated higher in imageability than uncued verbs.

The human brain contains temporal voice areas (TVA) [1] involved in an acoustic-based representation of voice identity [2-6], but the underlying coding mechanisms remain unknown. Indirect evidence suggests that identity representation in these areas could rely on a norm-based coding mechanism [4, 7-11]. Here, we show by using fMRI that voice identity is coded in the TVA as a function of acoustical distance to two internal voice prototypes (one male, one female)-approximated here by averaging a large number of same-gender voices by using morphing [12]. Voices more distant from their prototype are perceived as more distinctive and elicit greater neuronal activity in voice-sensitive cortex than closer voices-a phenomenon not merely explained by neuronal adaptation [13, 14]. Moreover, explicit manipulations of distance-to-mean by morphing voices toward (or away from) their prototype elicit reduced (or enhanced) neuronal activity. These results indicate that voice-sensitive cortex integrates relevant acoustical features into a complex representation referenced to idealized male and female voice prototypes. More generally, they shed light on remarkable similarities in cerebral representations of facial and vocal identity.","[Latinus, Marianne; McAleer, Phil; Bestelmeyer, Patricia E.

In social psychology, inferences about states and traits of others as well as activations of semantic categories and corresponding stereotypes have attracted great interest. On the other hand, research on emotion and reward demonstrated affective and motivational influences of social cues on the observer, which in turn modulate attention, categorization, evaluation, and decision processes. While inferential and categorical social processes have been shown to recruit a network of cortical brain regions associated with mentalizing and evaluation, the affective influence of social cues has been linked to subcortical areas that play a central role in detection of salient sensory input and reward processing. In order to extend existing integrative approaches to person perception, both the inferential-categorical processing of information about others, and affective and motivational influences of this information on the beholder should be taken into account.","[Kuzmanovic, Bojana; Jefferson, Anneli] Res Ctr Juelich, Inst Neurosci & Med Eth Neurosci INM 8, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Kuzmanovic, Bojana; Vogeley, Kai] Univ Hosp Cologne, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Cologne, Germany; [Bente, Gary] Univ Cologne, Dept Psychol, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Vogeley, Kai] Res Ctr Juelich, Inst Neurosci & Med Cognit Neurol INM 3, D-52425 Julich, Germany","Kuzmanovic, B (reprint author), Res Ctr Juelich, Inst Neurosci & Med Eth Neurosci INM 8, D-52425 Julich, Germany.","b.kuzmanovic@fz-juelich.de","Vogeley, K/E-4860-2012","Vogeley, K/0000-0002-5891-5831; Jefferson, Anneli/0000-0002-1870-1361","","","","67","2","3","2","32","FRONTIERS RESEARCH FOUNDATION","LAUSANNE","PO BOX 110, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND","1662-5161","","","FRONT HUM NEUROSCI","Front.

The results showed common activation in areas related to mentalizing, across all types of causes or instructions (posterior superior temporal sulcus, temporo-parietal junction, precuneus). However, the medial prefrontal cortex was activated only under spontaneous instructions, but not under intentional instruction. This suggests a bias toward person attributions (e.g. fundamental attribution bias).

Present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study explores the common and distinct neural activity of counterfactual and episodic thinking by directly comparing the imagining of upward counterfactuals (creating better outcomes for negative past events) with the re-experiencing of negative past events and the imagining of positive future events. Results confirm that episodic and counterfactual thinking share a common brain network, involving a core memory network (hippocampal area, temporal lobes, midline, and lateral parietal lobes) and prefrontal areas that might be related to mentalizing (medial prefrontal cortex) and performance monitoring (right prefrontal cortex). In contrast to episodic past and future thinking, counterfactual thinking recruits some of these areas more strongly and extensively, and additionally activates the bilateral inferior parietal lobe and posterior medial frontal cortex.

Using fMRI we took one step in that direction and examined the neural mechanisms underlying enhanced attachment security. Participants were exposed to explicit and implicit security- and insecurity-related words. Security priming led to co-occurring activation in brain areas reflective of cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes (e.g., medial frontal cortex, parahippocampus, BA 6). There were activation differences based on attachment style. This research serves as an important step in mapping out the security process and supports a conceptualization of security as part of a behavioral system with multiple components.

To better understand how cooperation both succeeds and fails, recent research in cognitive neuroscience has begun to explore novel paradigms to examine how cooperative mechanisms may be encoded in the brain. By combining functional neuroimaging techniques with simple but realistic tasks adapted from experimental economics, this approach allows for the discrimination and modeling of processes that are important in cooperative behavior. Here, we review evidence demonstrating that many of the processes underlying cooperation overlap with rather fundamental brain mechanisms, such as, for example, those involved in reward, punishment and learning. In addition, we review how social expectations induced by an interactive context and the experience of social emotions may influence cooperation and its associated underlying neural circuitry, and we describe factors that appear important for generating cooperation, such as the provision of incentives. These findings illustrate how cognitive neuroscience can contribute to the development of more accurate, brain-based, models of cooperative decision making.","[Stallen, Mirre] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Stallen, Mirre; Sanfey, Alan G.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Sanfey, Alan G.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Behav Sci Inst, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands","Stallen, M (reprint author), Erasmus Univ, Kapittelweg 29, NL-6525 EN Nijmegen, Netherlands.","m.stallen@donders.ru.nl","Sanfey, Alan/D-2350-2010","","","","","63","11","13","1","63","SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC","THOUSAND OAKS","2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA","1073-8584","1089-4098","","NEUROSCIENTIST","Neuroscientist","JUN","2013","19","3","","","","","292","303","","10.1177/1073858412469728","","","","12","Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences","Neurosciences & Neurology","143IL","WOS:000318860800011","23300215","","","","2019-02-21","searchterm","searchterm_records_3501-4000.txt"

In a novel neuroimaging paradigm, participants processed two abstract concepts (convince, arithmetic) and two concrete concepts (rolling, red) deeply and repeatedly during a concept-scene matching task that grounded each concept in typical contexts. Using a catch trial design, neural activity associated with each concept word was separated from neural activity associated with subsequent visual scenes to assess activations underlying the detailed semantics of each concept. We predicted that brain regions underlying mentalizing and social cognition (e. g., medial prefrontal cortex, superior temporal sulcus) would become active to represent semantic content central to convince, whereas brain regions underlying numerical cognition (e. g., bilateral intraparietal sulcus) would become active to represent semantic content central to arithmetic. The results supported these predictions, suggesting that the meanings of abstract concepts arise from distributed neural systems that represent concept-specific content.","[Wilson-Mendenhall, Christine D.] Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Simmons, W.

We assume that a profound examination of neural structures associated with decision-making processes is needed to learn more about Machiavellians' abilities in exploiting other people. More specifically, we predicted that high-Mach people would show elevated activity in the brain areas involved in reward-seeking, anticipation of risky situations, and inference making. To test this hypothesis, we used an fMRI technique to examine individuals as they played the Trust Game. In accordance with our predictions, we found consistent activation in high-Machs' thalamus and anterior cingulate cortex (player 1), and dorsal anterior insula/inferior frontal gyrus (player 2). We suggest that Machiavellians conduct specific neural operations in social dilemma situations that make them successful in exploiting others. Machiavellians may have cognitive heuristics that enable them to make predictions about the future reward in a basically risky and unpredictable situation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Only very recently, a role for somatosensation in social perception has been suggested. Numerous studies reported vicarious responses in the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) and other areas merely when seeing others being touched. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that these vicarious somatosensory responses can be linked with inter-individual differences in empathy. However, beyond empathy other personality traits have been shown to interact with social perception and behavior. Here we tested if personality traits according to the Five-Factor-Model interact with vicarious activation in somatosensory brain regions. We conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in which subjects viewed video clips showing simple non-painful touch to a hand and a control condition including the same visual and motion parts. Results revealed vicarious somatosensory activation when viewing the touched hand, as expected. Vicarious activation in SI showed a trend for a positive correlation with the personality trait openness to experience. Moreover, mirror-like responses in the insula were strongly correlated with the personality trait conscientiousness, suggesting links to processes of self-control. We conclude that vicarious brain responses to seen touch seem to interact with personality traits.","[Schaefer, Michael; Rotte, Michael; Heinze, Hans-Jochen] Univ Magdeburg, Dept Neurol, D-39120 Magdeburg, Germany; [Denke, Claudia] Charite, Dept Anesthesiol & Intens Care Med, D-13353 Berlin, Germany","Schaefer, M (reprint author), Univ Magdeburg, Dept Neurol, Leipziger Str 44, D-39120 Magdeburg, Germany.","mischa@neuro2.med.uni-magdeburg.de","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Scha105/5-1]","Michael Schaefer was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Scha105/5-1).","","46","5","5","0","17","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","1662-5161","","","FRONT HUM NEUROSCI","Front.

Thus, a social view of rationality is suggested. The theory differentiates between two kinds of rationality, the emancipative communicative and the strategic or instrumental reasoning. Using experimental designs in an fMRI setting, recent studies explored similar questions of reasoning in the social world and linked them with a neural network including prefrontal and parietal brain regions. Here, we employed an fMRI approach to highlight brain areas associated with strategic and communicative reasoning according to the theory of communicative action. Participants were asked to assess different social scenarios with respect to communicative or strategic rationality. We found a network of brain areas including temporal pole, precuneus, and STS more activated when participants performed communicative reasoning compared with strategic thinking and a control condition. These brain regions have been previously linked to moral sensitivity. In contrast, strategic rationality compared with communicative reasoning and control was associated with less activation in areas known to be related to moral sensitivity, emotional processing, and language control. The results suggest that strategic reasoning is associated with reduced social and emotional cognitions and may use different language related networks. Thus, the results demonstrate experimental support for the assumptions of the theory of communicative action.","[Schaefer, Michael; Heinze, Hans-Jochen; Rotte, Michael] Univ Magdeburg, Dept Neurol, D-39106 Magdeburg, Germany; [Denke, Claudia] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Dept Anesthesiol & Intens Care Med, Berlin, Germany","Schaefer, M (reprint author), Univ Magdeburg, Dept Neurol, D-39106 Magdeburg, Germany.","mischa@neuro2.med.uni-magdeburg.de","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Scha105/6-2]","This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Scha105/6-2).

However, these languages also differ in orthographic transparency. To disentangle the effect of orthographic transparency from visual appearance, we trained subjects to read the same artificial script either as an alphabetic (i.e., transparent orthography) or a logographic (i.e., nontransparent orthography) language. Consistent with our previous results, both types of phonological training enhanced activations in the left fusiform gyrus. More interestingly, the laterality in the fusiform gyrus (especially the posterior region) was modulated by the orthographic transparency of the artificial script (more left-lateralized activation after alphabetic training than after logographic training).

Both the science and its possible use as courtroom evidence have spawned much scholarly discussion. This article contributes to the interdisciplinary debate by identifying the missing pieces of the scientific puzzle that need to be completed if fMRI-based lie detection is to meet the standards of either legal reliability or general acceptance. The article provides a balanced analysis of the current science and the cases in which litigants have sought to introduce fMRI-based lie detection. Identifying the key limitations of the science as expert evidence, the article explores the problems that arise from using scientific evidence before it is proven valid and reliable.

One problem is that the spontaneous onset of self-generated mental activity makes it hard to distinguish the events that control the occurrence of the experience from those processes that ensure the continuity of an internal train of thought once initiated. This review demonstrates that a distinction between process and occurrence (a) provides theoretical clarity that has been absent from current discussions of self-generated mental activity, (b) affords conceptual leverage on seemingly disparate results associating the state with both domain-general processes and task error, and (c) draws attention to important questions for understanding unconstrained thought in contexts such as psychopathology and education. It is suggested that identifying the moment that self-generated mental events begin is a necessary next step in moving toward a testable account of why the mind has evolved to neglect the present in favor of ruminations on the past or imaginary musings of what may yet come to pass.","[Smallwood, Jonathan] Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Leipzig, Germany","Smallwood, J (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Dept Social Neurosci, Stephanstr 1A, Leipzig, Germany.","smallwood@cbs.mpg.de","","Smallwood, Jonathan/0000-0002-7298-2459","","","","110","183","188","3","149","AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","WASHINGTON","750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","0033-2909","1939-1455","","PSYCHOL BULL","Psychol.

Important activation differences exist, however, depending upon the perceived competence of the advisor. Consistently, additional analyses demonstrate that integrating others' advice, i.e., how much participants actually adjust their initial estimate, correlates with neural activity in the centromedial amygdala in the case of a competent and with activity in visual cortex in the case of an incompetent advisor.

These abilities may be partially supported by a large capacity for maintaining and manipulating social information. Efficient social working memory might arise from two different sources: chunking of social information or a domain-specific buffer. We test these hypotheses with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) by manipulating sociality and working memory load in an n-back paradigm. We observe (i) an effect of load in the frontoparietal control network, (ii) an effect of sociality in regions associated with social cognition and face processing, and (iii) an interaction within the frontoparietal network such that social load has a smaller effect than nonsocial load. These results support the hypothesis that working memory is more efficient for social information than for nonsocial information, and suggest that chunking, rather than a domain-specific buffer, is the mechanism of this greater efficiency.

These shared representations have been assumed to provide indirect evidence for a human mirror neuron system, which is suggested to be a prerequisite of action comprehension. We aimed at clarifying whether shared representations in and beyond human mirror areas are specifically activated by affective facial expressions or whether they are activated by facial expressions independent of the emotional meaning. During neuroimaging, participants observed and executed happy and non-emotional facial expressions. Shared representations were revealed for happy facial expressions in the pars opercularis, the precentral gyrus, in the superior temporal gyrus/medial temporal gyrus (MTG), in the pre-supplementary motor area and in the right amygdala. All areas showed less pronounced activation in the non-emotional condition. When directly compared, significant stronger neural responses emerged for happy facial expressions in the pre-supplementary motor area and in the MTG than for non-emotional stimuli. We assume that activation of shared representations depends on the affect and (social) relevance of the facial expression. The pre-supplementary motor area is a core-shared representation-structure supporting observation and execution of affective contagious facial expressions and might have a modulatory role during the preparation of executing happy facial expressions.","[Kircher, Tilo] Univ Marburg, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Marburg, Germany; [Pohl, Anna; Thimm, Markus; Mathiak, Klaus] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Pohl, Anna; Thimm, Markus; Schulte-Ruether, Martin; Mathiak, Klaus] Univ Marburg, JARA Translat Brain Med, Marburg, Germany; [Krach, Soeren] Univ Marburg, Dept Neurol, Marburg, Germany; [Schulte-Ruether, Martin] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Child Neuropsychol Sect, Dept Child & Adolescent Psychiat, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Schulte-Ruether, Martin] Res Ctr Julich, Cognit Neurol Sect INM 3, Inst Neurosci & Med, Julich, Germany; [Anders, Silke] Med Univ Lubeck, Neuroimage Nord, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany; [Anders, Silke] Med Univ Lubeck, Dept Neurol, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany; [Mathiak, Klaus] Res Ctr Julich, Struct & Funct Org Brain INM 1, Inst Neurosci & Med, Julich, Germany","Pohl, A (reprint author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Pauwelsstr 30, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.","anpohl@ukaachen.de","Schulte-Ruther, Martin/F-4784-2013","Schulte-Ruther, Martin/0000-0002-7198-9923; Kircher, Tilo/0000-0002-2514-2625","Federal Ministry of Education and Research [BMBF] [FKZ 01GW0751]; Interdisciplinary Centre for Clinical Research of the Medical Faculty of the RWTH Aachen University [IZKF] [N2, N4-2]","We thank Simon Eickhoff and Thilo Kellermann for their kind and knowledgeable assistance in methodologies and statistics.

Given the importance of such 'affective touch' in social relationships, the current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study aimed to replicate the finding of 'social brain' involvement in processing CT-targeted touch and to examine the relationship between the neural response and individuals' social abilities. During an fMRI scan, 19 healthy adults received alternating blocks of slow (CT-optimal) and fast (non-optimal) brushing to the forearm. Relative to fast touch, the slow touch activated contralateral insula, superior temporal sulcus (STS), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and amygdala. Connectivity analyses revealed co-activation of the mPFC, insula and amygdala during slow touch. Additionally, participants' autistic traits negatively correlated with the response to slow touch in the OFC and STS. The current study replicates and extends findings of the involvement of a network of 'social brain' regions in processing CT-targeted affective touch, emphasizing the multimodal nature of this system. Variability in the brain response to such touch illustrates a tight coupling of social behavior and social brain function in typical adults.","[Voos, Avery C.; Pelphrey, Kevin A.; Kaiser, Martha D.] Yale Univ, Yale Child Study Ctr, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Kaiser, MD (reprint author), Yale Univ, 230 South Frontage Rd, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.","martha.kaiser@yale.edu","","","Harris Professorship; Yale Autism Center for Excellence from NIH [P50 MH081756]","We are grateful to India Morrison for helpful discussions of the results of this study and to Danielle Bolling for comments on an earlier version of this article.

To address this question, we had participant's complete functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while observing a friend and stranger experience social exclusion. Observing a friend's exclusion activated affective pain regions associated with the direct (i.e. firsthand) experience of exclusion [dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and insula], and this activation correlated with self-reported self-other overlap with the friend. Alternatively, observing a stranger's exclusion activated regions associated with thinking about the traits, mental states and intentions of others ['mentalizing'; dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), precuneus, and temporal pole]. Comparing activation from observing friend's vs stranger's exclusion showed increased activation in brain regions associated with the firsthand experience of exclusion (dACC and anterior insula) and with thinking about the self [medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC)]. Finally, functional connectivity analyses demonstrated that MPFC and affective pain regions activated in concert during empathy for friends, but not strangers. These results suggest empathy for friends' social suffering relies on emotion sharing and self-processing mechanisms, whereas empathy for strangers' social suffering may rely more heavily on mentalizing systems.","[Meyer, Meghan L.; Eisenberger, Naomi I.] Vanderbilt Univ, UCLA Psychol Dept, Nashville, TN 37240 USA; [Masten, Carrie L.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Psychol Sci, Nashville, TN 37240 USA; [Ma, Yina; Wang, Chenbo; Shi, Zhenhao; Han, Shihui] Peking Univ, Dept Psychol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","Han, SH (reprint author), Peking Univ, Dept Psychol, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.","shan@pku.edu.cn","Ma, Yina/H-6203-2017","Ma, Yina/0000-0002-5457-0354","National Natural Science Foundation of China [30910103901, 91024032]; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) [2010CB833903]; NSF East Asia and Pacific Summer Institute for U.S. Graduate Students","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project 30910103901, 91024032), National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program 2010CB833903), as well as the NSF East Asia and Pacific Summer Institute for U.S. Graduate Students.","","61","61","66","2","94","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

Faces comprise the most abundantly encountered cue used to classify human gender. Considering the importance of facial information in gender perception, relatively little is known about the mechanisms involved in perceiving gender through human facial cues. We used an event-related fMRI repetition suppression paradigm to explore the neural circuitry underlying gender perception from facial information. Participants viewed brief consecutive images consisting of either gender-same face pairings (two male faces or two female faces) or images of gender-different face pairings (a male face preceded or followed by a female face), while attending to facial attractiveness in both conditions. Using a region-of-interest approach, we found repetition suppression on gender-same trials within the left ventral temporal fusiform gyrus and in the right collateral sulcus. Whole-brain voxel-wise analyses revealed selectivity for face gender again in the right collateral sulcus, in addition to the left cuneus and the right lateral occipital gyrus.

Study design Using a longitudinal sample of 5119 school age children in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, this study investigated specific reading skill outcomes in the area of speed, fluency, accuracy, spelling, and comprehension in relation to prenatal nicotine exposure, after adjusting for potential mediators and confounders. Prenatal nicotine exposure was divided into 3 categories: high (>17 mg per day), low (<= 17 mg per day), and no exposure. Results We found that prenatal nicotine exposure was associated with increased risk of underperformance in specific reading skill outcomes after adjusting for potential mediators and confounders (P = .006). The effect of poor performance in decoding single words was most pronounced among children with prenatal exposure to high levels of nicotine in conjunction with a phonological deficit. Overall, the results showed that maternal smoking has moderate to large associations with delayed or decreased reading skills of children in the Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Conclusions High prenatal nicotine exposure has a negative association with reading performance in school age children. In addition, modeling showed that environmental factors significantly moderated the interaction between prenatal nicotine exposure and reading skill outcomes.

Behavioral studies have shown that children take more than a decade of exposure and training to become proficient at processing faces at the individual level. The neurodevelopmental trajectories for different aspects of face-processing are still poorly understood. In this study, we used an fMR-adaptation design to investigate differential processing of three face aspects (identity, expression and gaze) in children, adolescents and adults. We found that, while all three tasks showed some overlap in activation patterns, there was a significant age effect in the occipital and temporal lobes and the inferior frontal gyrus. More importantly, the degree of adaptation differed across the three age groups in the inferior occipital gyrus, a core face processing area that has been shown in previous studies to be both integral and necessary for individual-level face processing. In the younger children, adaptation in this region seemed to suggest the use of a predominantly featural processing strategy, whereas adaptation effects in the adults exhibited a more strategic pattern that depended on the task. Interestingly, our sample of adolescents did not exhibit any differential adaptation effects: possibly reflecting increased heterogeneity in processing strategies in this age group. Our results support the notion that, in line with improving behavioral face-processing abilities, core face-responsive regions develop throughout the first two decades of life. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The sonification of otherwise mute movements by sounds based on kinematic parameters of the movement has been shown to improve motor performance and perception of movements. Results: Here we demonstrate in a group of healthy young non-athletes that congruently (sounds match visual movement kinematics) vs. incongruently (no match) sonified breaststroke movements of a human avatar lead to better perceptual judgement of small differences in movement velocity. Moreover, functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed enhanced activity in superior and medial posterior temporal regions including the superior temporal sulcus, known as an important multisensory integration site, as well as the insula bilaterally and the precentral gyrus on the right side. Functional connectivity analysis revealed pronounced connectivity of the STS with the basal ganglia and thalamus as well as frontal motor regions for the congruent stimuli. This was not seen to the same extent for the incongruent stimuli. Conclusions: We conclude that sonification of movements amplifies the activity of the human action observation system including subcortical structures of the motor loop.

A psychological definition states that adaptive social behaviors are ""self-performing"" and ""contain a solution."" The present study investigated the neural correlates of adaptive social responses to frustrating situations by assessing the dimension of causal attribution. Based on attribution theory, internal causality refers to one's aptitudes that cause natural responses in real-life situations, whereas external causality refers to environmental factors, such as experimental conditions, causing such responses. To investigate the issue, we developed a novel approach that assesses causal attribution under experimental conditions. During fMRI scanning, subjects were required to engage in virtual frustrating situations and play the role of protagonists by verbalizing social responses, which were socially adaptive or non-adaptive. After fMRI scanning, the subjects reported their causal attribution index of the psychological reaction to the experimental condition. We performed a correlation analysis between the causal attribution index and brain activity. We hypothesized that the brain region whose activation would have a positive and negative correlation with the self-reported index of the causal attributions would be regarded as neural correlates of internal and external causal attribution of social responses, respectively. Results: We found a significant negative correlation between external causal attribution and neural responses in the right anterior temporal lobe for adaptive social behaviors. Conclusion: This region is involved in the integration of emotional and social information. These results suggest that, particularly in adaptive social behavior, the social demands of frustrating situations, which involve external causality, may be integrated by a neural response in the right anterior temporal lobe.","[Sekiguchi, Atsushi] Tohoku Univ, Div Med Neuroimage Anal, Dept Community Med Supports, Tohoku Med Megabank Org,Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808575, Japan; [Sekiguchi, Atsushi; Sugiura, Motoaki; Yokoyama, Satoru; Kawashima, Ryuta] Tohoku Univ, IDAC, Dept Funct Brain Imaging, Sendai, Miyagi 9808575, Japan; [Sugiura, Motoaki] Tohoku Univ, Int Res Inst Disaster Sci, Sendai, Miyagi 9808575, Japan; [Sassa, Yuko; Kawashima, Ryuta] Tohoku Univ, IDAC, Div Dev Cognit Neurosci, Sendai, Miyagi 9808575, Japan; [Horie, Kaoru] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Language & Cultures, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Sato, Shigeru] Tohoku Univ, Sendai, Miyagi 9808575, Japan","Sekiguchi, A (reprint author), Tohoku Univ, Div Med Neuroimage Anal, Dept Community Med Supports, Tohoku Med Megabank Org,Aoba Ku, Seiryo Machi, Sendai, Miyagi 9808575, Japan.","asekiguchi@idac.tohoku.ac.jp","","xing zhi, shi zhi/0000-0003-3289-5681","International Research Institute of Disaster Science; MEXT [KAKENHI 22790611, 24790653]","We thank Drs.

We found that the olfactometer threshold test correlated highly with the staircase method, and that it possessed suitable test-retest reliability.

This study investigated the neural substrates involved in the effect of spontaneous verbal labeling on memorizing increasingly complex sequences of hand movements. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test our hypothesis that when verbal labels were employed, neuronal activity in imitation-related regions, such as the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), would be reduced, whereas without verbal labels, neuronal activation would increase. Sixteen healthy adults satisfactorily performed an immediate imitation task involving six levels of increasing complexity. After the fMRI experiment, participants reported at which complexity level they had formed verbal labels. Based on the self-report, we categorized the task blocks at each complexity level as either with verbal labeling (VL+) or without (VL-). Compared with VL+, the VL- condition activated the left IFG, bilateral middle frontal gyri, left precentral gyrus, and the right angular gyrus, whereas the opposite contrast revealed no significant brain activation. Verbal labeling seems to serve as an efficient heuristic that reduces the cost of cortical activation in the imitation-related regions.

This ability to modulate pain has the potential to affect therapeutic analgesia substantially and constitutes a foundation for nonpharmacological pain relief. In this study, we investigated (1) brain regions involved in visual cue modulation of pain during anticipation of pain, pain administration, and pain rating; and (2) the association between pretest resting state functional connectivity and the magnitude of cue effects on pain ratings. We found that after cue conditioning, visual cues can significantly modulate subjective pain ratings. Functional magnetic resonance imaging results suggested that brain regions pertaining to the frontoparietal network (prefrontal and parietal cortex) and a pain/emotion modulatory region (rostral anterior cingulate cortex) are involved in cue modulation during both pain anticipation and administration stage. Most interestingly, we found that pretest resting state functional connectivity between the frontoparietal network (as identified by independent component analysis) and the rostral anterior cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal cortex was positively associated with cue effects on pain rating changes. We believe that these findings will shed new light on our understanding of variable cue/expectancy effects across individuals and how the intrinsic connectivity of the brain may influence expectancy-induced modulation of pain.

A challenge in making inferences from these statistical maps is the noise and potential confounds that arise from the head motion that occurs within and between acquisition volumes. This motion results in the scan plane being misaligned during acquisition, ultimately leading to reduced statistical power when maps are constructed at the group level. In most cases, an attempt is made to correct for this motion through the use of retrospective analysis methods. In this paper, we use a prospective active marker motion correction (PRAMMO) system that uses radio frequency markers for real-time tracking of motion, enabling on-line slice plane correction. We show that the statistical power of the activation maps is substantially increased using PRAMMO compared to conventional retrospective correction. Analysis of our results indicates that the PRAMMO acquisition reduces the variance without decreasing the signal component of the BOLD (beta). Using PRAMMO could thus improve the overall statistical power of fMRI based BOLD measurements, leading to stronger inferences of the nature of processing in the human brain. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Rejection from social groups is especially detrimental, rendering the ability to detect threats to social relationships and respond in adaptive ways critical. Indeed, previous research has shown that experiencing social rejection alters the processing of subsequent social cues in a variety of socially affiliative and avoidant ways. Because social perception and cognition occurs spontaneously and automatically, detecting threats to social relationships may occur without conscious awareness or control. Here, we investigated the automaticity of social threat detection by examining how implicit primes affect neural responses to social stimuli. However, despite using a well-established implicit priming paradigm and large sample size, we failed to find any evidence that implicit primes induced changes at the neural level. That implicit primes influence behavior has been demonstrated repeatedly and across a variety of domains, and our goal is not to question these effects.

To address this question, we had participants commit a mock theft in a laboratory setting, and then interrogated them while they underwent functional MRI (fMRI) scanning. Crucially, during some parts of the interrogation participants believed a lie-detector was activated, whereas in other parts they were told it was switched-off. We were thus able to examine the neural activity associated with the contrast between producing true vs. false claims, as well as the independent contrast between believing that deception could and could not be detected. We found increased activation in the right amygdala and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), as well as the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), during the production of false (compared to true) claims. Importantly, there was a significant interaction between the effects of deception and belief in the left temporal pole and right hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus, where activity increased during the production of deception when participants believed their false claims could be detected, but not when they believed the lie-detector was switched-off. As these regions are associated with binding socially complex perceptual input and memory retrieval, we conclude that producing deceptive behavior in a context in which one believes this deception can be detected is associated with a cognitively taxing effort to reconcile contradictions between one's actions and recollections.","[Sip, Kamila E.; Roepstorff, Andreas; Frith, Christopher D.] Aarhus Univ Hosp, Ctr Functionally Integrat Neurosci, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; [Sip, Kamila E.; Roepstorff, Andreas; McGregor, William B.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Aesthet & Commun Linguist, Aarhus, Denmark; [Sip, Kamila E.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Psychol, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Carmel, David] Univ Edinburgh, Dept Psychol, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Marchant, Jennifer L.] UCL, Inst Cognit Neurosci, London, England; [Marchant, Jennifer L.; Frith, Christopher D.] UCL, Wellcome Trust Ctr Neuroimaging, London, England; [Li, Jian] Peking Univ, Dept Psychol, IDG McGovern Inst Brain Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Petrovic, Predrag] Karolinska Inst, Dept Clin Neurosci, Stockholm, Sweden","Sip, KE (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Social & Affect Neurosci Lab, Dept Psychol, Smith Hall,Room 301,101 Warren St, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.","ksip@psychology.rutgers.edu","","","University of Aarhus; Danish Research Council for Culture and Communication; Danish National Research Foundation; Wellcome Trust","This work was supported by University of Aarhus, The Danish Research Council for Culture and Communication, The Danish National Research Foundation's grant to Center of Functionally Integrative Neuroscience and the Wellcome Trust.","","58","7","7","2","48","FRONTIERS RESEARCH FOUNDATION","LAUSANNE","PO BOX 110, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND","1662-5161","","","FRONT HUM NEUROSCI","Front.

Thus, in order to understand a word, listeners have to extract the pitch patterns in addition to its phonemes. Can the correct word meaning still be accessed in sentence contexts if pitch patterns of words are altered? If so, how is this accomplished? The present study attempts to address such questions with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Native speakers of Mandarin Chinese listened to normal and pitch-flattened (monotone) speech inside the scanner. The behavioral results indicated that they rated monotone sentences as intelligible as normal sentences, and performed equally well in a dictation test on the two types of sentences. The fMRI results showed that both types of sentences elicited similar activation in the left insular, middle and inferior temporal gyri, but the monotone sentences elicited greater activation in the left planum temporale (PT) compared with normal sentences. These results demonstrate that lexical meaning can still be accessed in pitch-flattened Chinese sentences, and that this process is realized by automatic recovery of the phonological representations of lexical tones from the altered tonal patterns. Our findings suggest that the details of spoken pitch patterns are not essential for adequate lexical-semantic processing during sentence comprehension even in tonal languages like Mandarin Chinese, given that listeners can automatically use additional neural and cognitive resources to recover distorted tonal patterns in sentences.

Participants judged the relative distances between a dot and a line in visual stimuli during task blocks and alternated finger presses during control blocks. Behaviorally, East Asians responded faster than Westerners, reflecting greater ease of the task for East Asians. In response to the greater task difficulty, Westerners showed greater neural engagement compared to East Asians in frontal, parietal, and occipital areas. Moreover, Westerners also showed greater suppression of the default network-a brain network that is suppressed under condition of high cognitive challenge.

As hypothesized, when reappraising, decision acceptance rates were altered, with a greater number of unfair offers accepted while down-regulating and a greater number of unfair offers rejected while upregulating, both relative to the baseline condition. At the neural level, during reappraisal, significant activations were observed in the inferior and middle frontal gyrus (MFG), in addition to the medial prefrontal cortex and cingulate gyrus for unfair offers only. Regulated decisions involved left inferior frontal gyrus for upregulation and MFG for down-regulation strategies, respectively.

In this study, we applied fMRI to explore the neural coding of physical effort costs as opposed to costs associated with risky rewards. Using an incentive-compatible valuation mechanism, we separately measured the subjective costs associated with effortful and risky options. As expected, subjective costs of options increased with both increasing effort and increasing risk. Despite the similar nature of behavioral discounting of effort and risk, distinct regions of the brain coded these two cost types separately, with anterior insula primarily processing risk costs and midcingulate and supplementary motor area (SMA) processing effort costs. To investigate integration of the two cost types, we also presented participants with options that combined effortful and risky elements. We found that the frontal pole integrates effort and risk costs through functional coupling with the SMA and insula. The degree to which the latter two regions influenced frontal pole activity correlated with participant-specific behavioral sensitivity to effort and risk costs. These data support the notion that, although physical effort costs may appear to be behaviorally similar to other types of costs, such as risk, they are treated separately at the neural level and are integrated only if there is a need to do so.","[Burke, Christopher J.; Kahnt, Thorsten; Park, Soyoung Q.; Tobler, Philippe N.] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Lab Social & Neural Syst Res, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Brunger, Christian] Maastricht Univ, Fac Psychol & Neurosci, NL-6229 ER Maastricht, Netherlands","Burke, CJ (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Lab Social & Neural Syst Res, Blumlisalpstr 10, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.","christopher.burke@econ.uzh.ch","","Tobler, Philippe/0000-0002-4915-9448; Kahnt, Thorsten/0000-0002-3575-2670","Swiss National Science Foundation [PP00P1_128574]; Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research in Affective Sciences","We thank Christoph Hollnagel and Adrian Etter for helpful discussions.

However, less attention has been given to how social information influences these processes, and the neural systems that mediate this influence. Here we sought to address these questions by using tasks similar to ones that have been used to study individual decision making behavior, and adding conditions in which participants were given trial-by-trial information about the performance of other individuals (their choices and/or their rewards) simultaneously playing the same tasks. We asked two questions: How does such information about the behavior of others influence performance in otherwise simple decision tasks, and what neural systems mediate this influence? We found that bilateral insula exhibited a parametric relationship to the degree of misalignment of the individual's performance with those of others in the group. Furthermore, activity in the bilateral insula significantly predicted participants' subsequent choices to align their behavior with others in the group when they were misaligned either in their choices (independent of success) or their degree of success (independent of specific choices). These findings add to the growing body of empirical data suggesting that the insula participates in an important way in social information processing and decision making.","[Tomlin, Damon; Holmes, Philip; Cohen, Jonathan D.] Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Nedic, Andrea] Princeton Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Prentice, Deborah A.; Cohen, Jonathan D.] Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Holmes, Philip] Princeton Univ, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Holmes, Philip] Princeton Univ, Program Appl & Computat Math, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Tomlin, D (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Princeton Neurosci Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.","dtomlin@princeton.edu","","","Air Force Office of Scientific Research, MURI-16 Project [ONR BAA 06-028]; John Templeton Foundation","This work was made possible by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, MURI-16 Project, ONR BAA 06-028.

However, imaging and neuropsychological findings about frontal pathology in pedophilia are heterogeneous. In our study we therefore address inhibition behaviorally and by means of functional imaging, aiming to assess how inhibition in pedophilia is related to a differential recruitment of frontal brain areas. Method: Eleven pedophilic subjects and 7 non-pedophilic controls underwent fMRI while performing a go/no-go task composed of neutral letters. Results: Pedophilic subjects showed a slower reaction time and less accurate visual target discrimination. fMRI voxel-level ANOVA revealed as a main effect of the go/no-go task an activation of prefrontal and parietal brain regions in the no-go condition, while the left anterior cingulate, precuneus and gyrus angularis became more activated in the go condition. In addition, a group x task interaction was found in the left precuneus and gyrus angularis. This interaction was based on an attenuated deactivation of these brain regions in the pedophilic group during performance of the no-go condition. The positive correlation between blood oxygen level-dependent imaging signal and reaction time in these brain areas indicates that attenuated deactivation is related to the behavioral findings. Conclusion: Slower reaction time and less accurate visual target discrimination in pedophilia was accompanied by attenuated deactivation of brain areas belonging to the default mode network. Our findings thus support the notion that behavioral differences might also derive from self-related processes and not necessarily from frontal lobe pathology. (C) 2013 S.

Whether we ultimately approach or avoid others may depend on such judgments. Method: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine the neural basis for such approachability judgments and the relationship between these judgments and trait anxiety. Participants viewed ambiguous (i.e. neutral) or relatively unambiguous (i.e. angry, happy) faces, assessing either the approachability or the sex of the person depicted. Results: Neutral faces elicited more inconsistent responses within participants only during approachability judgment, suggesting ambiguous property as signals. The contrast pertaining to the interaction between task and face valence demonstrated activation in several areas, such that the left amygdala and medial, middle and inferior frontal gyri were responsive to angry faces when subjects were asked to recognize the sex (implicit task) and to neutral faces when required to discern the approachability (explicit task). Moreover, the blood oxygenation level-de-pendent change within the left amygdala in response to neutral faces during the judgment of approachability was positively correlated with participant trait anxiety. Conclusions: These findings extend a proposed model of social cognition by highlighting the functional engagement of the amygdala in approachability judgments, which underlie an individual's sensitivity to ambiguous sources of probable threat.

Our exploratory study examines the association between ad-elicited emotional arousal and predetermined ad memorability, as a proxy for memory for the ad. Results reveal greater amygdala activation in memorable (versus unmemorable) ads, reinforcing the association between ad-elicited emotional arousal and memory for the ad. Amygdala activation was accompanied by activation in the brain region termed the superior temporal sulcus (STS), which is involved in social cognition. These results are indicative of a sociocognitive emotional memory process, which has been neglected in past research.

In an fMRI experiment participants read a number of proverbs without explicitly evaluating them. In a post-scan rating they rated each item for familiarity and beauty. These individual ratings were correlated with the functional data to investigate the neural correlates of implicit aesthetic judgments. We identified clusters in which BOLD activity was correlated with individual post-scan beauty ratings. This indicates that some spontaneous aesthetic evaluation takes place during reading, even if not required by the task. Positive correlations were found in the ventral striatum and in medial prefrontal cortex, likely reflecting the rewarding nature of sentences that are aesthetically pleasing. On the contrary, negative correlations were observed in the classic left frontotemporal reading network. Midline structures and bilateral temporoparietal regions correlated positively with familiarity, suggesting a shift from the task-network towards the default network with increasing familiarity.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined experience-dependent functional plasticity in accessing interoceptive representations by comparing graduates of a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction course to a waitlisted control group. IA to respiratory sensations was contrasted against two visual tasks, controlling for attentional requirements non-specific to IA such as maintaining sensation and suppressing distraction. In anatomically partitioned analyses of insula activity, MT predicted greater IA-related activity in anterior dysgranular insula regions, consistent with greater integration of interoceptive sensation with external context. MT also predicted decreased recruitment of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) during IA, and altered functional connectivity between the DMPFC and the posterior insula, putative primary interoceptive cortex. Furthermore, meditation practice compliance predicted greater posterior insula and reduced visual pathway recruitment during IA. These findings suggest that interoceptive training modulates task-specific cortical recruitment, analogous to training-related plasticity observed in the external senses. Further, DMPFC modulation of IA networks may be an important mechanism by which MT alters information processing in the brain, increasing the contribution of interoception to perceptual experience.","[Farb, Norman A.

Activity in the DMN is associated with functional connections with the striatum and dopamine (DA) levels in this brain region. A functional single-nucleotide polymorphism within the dopamine D2 receptor gene (DRD2, rs1076560 G > T) shifts splicing of the 2 D2 isoforms, D2 short and D2 long, and has been associated with striatal DA signaling as well as with cognitive processing. However, the effects of this polymorphism on DMN have not been explored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of rs1076560 on DMN and striatal connectivity and on their relationship with striatal DA signaling. Twenty-eight subjects genotyped for rs1076560 underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during a working memory task and 123 55 I-Fluoropropyl-2-beta-carbomethoxy-3-beta(4-iodophenyl) nortropan Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ([I-123]-FP-CIT SPECT) imaging (a measure of dopamine transporter [DAT] binding). Spatial group-independent component (IC) analysis was used to identify DMN and striatal ICs. Within the anterior DMN IC, GG subjects had relatively greater connectivity in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), which was directly correlated with striatal DAT binding. Within the posterior DMN IC, GG subjects had reduced connectivity in posterior cingulate relative to T carriers. Additionally, rs1076560 genotype predicted connectivity differences within a striatal network, and these changes were correlated with connectivity in MPFC and posterior cingulate within the DMN. These results suggest that genetically determined D2 receptor signaling is associated with DMN connectivity and that these changes are correlated with striatal function and presynaptic DA signaling.","[Sambataro, Fabio] Ist Italiano Tecnol UniPr, Brain Ctr Motor & Social Cognit, Parma, Italy; [Fazio, Leonardo; Sinibaldi, Lorenzo; Popolizio, Teresa; Bertolino, Alessandro] Ist Ricovero & Cura Carattere Sci, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy; [Taurisano, Paolo; Gelao, Barbara; Porcelli, Annamaria; Mancini, Marina; Ursini, Gianluca; Masellis, Rita; Caforio, Grazia; Di Giorgio, Annabella; Blasi, Giuseppe; Bertolino, Alessandro] Univ Bari, Psychiat Neurosci Grp, Dept Neurol & Psychiat Sci, I-70124 Bari, Italy; [Niccoli-Asabella, Artor] Univ Bari, Nucl Med Unit, Dept Internal Med & Publ Med, I-70124 Bari, Italy","Bertolino, A (reprint author), Ist Ricovero & Cura Carattere Sci, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.","a.bertolino@psichiat.uniba.it","Niccoli Asabella, Artor/M-1745-2015; Di Giorgio, Annabella/D-7353-2017; Sambataro, Fabio/E-3426-2010; Taurisano, Paolo/U-1828-2017","Niccoli Asabella, Artor/0000-0002-1227-029X; Di Giorgio, Annabella/0000-0001-7876-3495; Sambataro, Fabio/0000-0003-2102-416X; Taurisano, Paolo/0000-0001-6140-9326; Blasi, Giuseppe/0000-0003-0878-1131","Marie Curie Reintegration Grant [FP7-276981]","Marie Curie Reintegration Grant (FP7-276981) to F.S.","","55","30","30","0","14","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0586-7614","","","SCHIZOPHRENIA BULL","Schizophr.

Considering that people often make decisions on behalf of others, it is intriguing that there is little neurobiological evidence on how decisions for others differ from those for oneself. The present study directly compared risky decisions for self with those for another person using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants were asked to perform a gambling task on behalf of themselves (decision-for-self condition) or another person (decision-for-other condition) while in the scanner. Their task was to choose between a low-risk option (i.e., win or lose 10 points) and a high-risk option (i.e., win or lose 90 points) with variable levels of winning probability. Compared with choices regarding others, those regarding oneself were more risk-averse at lower winning probabilities and more risk-seeking at higher winning probabilities, perhaps due to stronger affective process during risky decisions for oneself compared with those for other. The brain-activation pattern changed according to the target, such that reward-related regions were more active in the decision-for-self condition than in the decision-for-other condition, whereas brain regions related to the theory of mind (ToM) showed greater activation in the decision-for-other condition than in the decision-for-self condition. Parametric modulation analysis using individual decision models revealed that activation of the amygdala and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) were associated with value computations for oneself and for another, respectively, during risky financial decisions. The results of the present study suggest that decisions for oneself and for other may recruit fundamentally distinct neural processes, which can be mainly characterized as dominant affective/impulsive and cognitive/regulatory processes, respectively.","[Jung, Daehyun] Korea Univ, Dept Brain & Cognit Engn, Lab Social & Decis Neurosci, Seoul 136701, South Korea; [Sul, Sunhae] Korea Univ, Wisdom Sci Ctr, Lab Social & Decis Neurosci, Seoul 136701, South Korea; [Kim, Hackjin] Korea Univ, Dept Psychol, Lab Social & Decis Neurosci, Seoul 136701, South Korea","Kim, H (reprint author), Korea Univ, Dept Psychol, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 136701, South Korea.","hackjinkim@korea.ac.kr","","Sul, Sunhae/0000-0001-5286-4343","Cognitive Neuroscience Program of the Korean Ministry of Science and Technology [M10644020003-06N4402-00310]; National Research Foundation of Korea Grant-Korean Government [NRF-2011-327-H00038]","This study was supported by the Cognitive Neuroscience Program of the Korean Ministry of Science and Technology (M10644020003-06N4402-00310) and the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2011-327-H00038).","","74","15","16","0","21","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","PO BOX 110, EPFL INNOVATION PARK, BUILDING I, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND","1662-453X","","","FRONT NEUROSCI-SWITZ","Front.

The present study aimed at offering the first insights into the effects of binge drinking on the neural processing of vocal affect. On the basis of an alcohol-consumption screening phase (204 students), 24 young adults (12 binge drinkers and 12 matched controls, mean age: 23.8 years) were selected and performed an emotional categorisation task on morphed vocal stimuli (drawn from a morphed fear-anger continuum) during fMRI scanning. In comparison to controls, binge drinkers presented (1) worse behavioural performance in emotional affect categorisation; (2) reduced activation of bilateral superior temporal gyrus; and (3) increased activation of right middle frontal gyrus. These results constitute the first evidence of altered cerebral processing of emotional stimuli in binge drinking and confirm that binge drinking leads to marked cerebral changes, which has important implications for research and clinical practice.

Although functional neuroimaging studies have begun to map the brain systems involved in humor appreciation, there are virtually no data on the structural correlates between gray matter volume and this capacity. Using voxel-based morphometry, the present study examined the association between gray matter volume and the ability to detect and appreciate humor. Fifty-nine healthy adults aged 18-45 years (30 men) underwent structural MRI and completed the University of Pennsylvania Humor Appreciation Test (HAT). After controlling for age and sex, gray matter volume of the left inferior frontal gyrus, left temporal pole, and left insula correlated positively with the appreciation of visual and verbal humor on the HAT, whereas the gray matter volume of the right inferior frontal gyrus correlated only with verbal humor appreciation scores. There were no negative correlations between gray matter volume and HAT performance. These data support a neurobiological basis for humor appreciation, particularly involving left-hemispheric cortical systems, and further suggest that individual differences in humor appreciation may be related to differences in regional gray matter volume.

We hypothesized that successful psychopaths, who have no criminal convictions but can be diagnosed with psychopathy in terms of personality characteristics, are skilled at regulating aggressive impulses, compared to incarcerated unsuccessful psychopaths. Methods: In this block-designed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we sought to clarify the neural mechanisms underlying differences in frustration-induced aggression as a function of psychopathy in non-criminal populations. Twenty male undergraduate students who completed a self-report psychopathy questionnaire were scanned while they completed a task in which they either could or could not punish other individuals who made unfair offers of monetary distribution. Results: Individuals with high psychopathic tendencies were less likely to make a decision to inflict costly punishment on people proposing unfair offers. During this decision-making, psychopathy was associated with less amygdala activity in response to the unfairness of offers. Moreover, the amygdala dysfunction in psychopathic individuals was associated with reduced functional connectivity with dopaminergic-related areas, including the striatum, when punishment was available compared to when it was unavailable. Limitations: The possibility that levels of psychopathic traits in a regular population were milder than in incarcerated populations cannot be ruled out. Conclusions: The findings indicate that amygdala dysfunction underlies affective deficits of psychopathy. We propose that the insensitivity of the amygdala to the affective significance of social stimuli contributes to an increased risk of violation of social norms, but enhances the ability to attenuate impulses toward maladaptive aggression in successful psychopaths.

Therefore, measuring the role of brands in consumers' cognitive and affective processes would be very helpful to better understand economic decision making. This work aimed at finding the neural correlates of automatic, spontaneous emotional response to brands, showing how deeply integrated are consumption symbols within the cognitive and affective processes of individuals. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was measured during a visual oddball paradigm consisting in the presentation of scrambled pictures as frequent stimuli, colored squares as targets, and brands and emotional pictures (selected from the International Affective Picture System [IAPS]) as emotionally-salient distractors. Affective rating of brands was assessed individually after scanning by a validated questionnaire. Results showed that, similarly to IAPS pictures, brands activated a well-defined emotional network, including amygdala and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, highly specific of affective valence.

Although face processing has been studied extensively, brain regions responsive to age have yet to be localized. Using evocative face morphs and fMRI, we segregate two areas extending beyond the previously established face-sensitive core network, centered on the inferior temporal sulci and angular gyri bilaterally, both of which process changes of facial age. By means of probabilistic tractography, we compare their patterns of functional activation and structural connectivity. The ventral portion of Wernicke's understudied perpendicular association fasciculus is shown to interconnect the two areas, and activation within these clusters is related to the probability of fiber connectivity between them. In addition, post-hoc age-rating competence is found to be associated with high response magnitudes in the left angular gyrus. Our results provide the first evidence that facial age has a distinct representation pattern in the posterior human brain. We propose that particular face-sensitive nodes interact with additional object-unselective quantification modules to obtain individual estimates of facial age. This brain network processing the age of faces differs from the cortical areas that have previously been linked to less developmental but instantly changeable face aspects. Our probabilistic method of associating activations with connectivity patterns reveals an exemplary link that can be used to further study, assess and quantify structure-function relationships.","[Homola, Gyoergy A.] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Neuroradiol, Wurzburg, Germany; [Jbabdi, Saad; Beckmann, Christian F.; Bartsch, Andreas J.] Univ Oxford, Ctr Funct MRI Brain, Oxford, England; [Beckmann, Christian F.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Beckmann, Christian F.] Univ Twente, MIRA Inst, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Bartsch, Andreas J.] Heidelberg Univ, Dept Neuroradiol, Heidelberg, Germany","Homola, GA (reprint author), Univ Wurzburg, Dept Neuroradiol, Wurzburg, Germany.","homola@neuroradiologie.uni-wuerzburg.de","Beckmann, Christian/E-6374-2012","Beckmann, Christian F./0000-0002-3373-3193; Jbabdi, Saad/0000-0003-3234-5639","UK Medical Research Council [G0800578]; German Doppelfeld Foundation; German Research Foundation (DFG); University of Wurzburg; Medical Research Council [G0800578]","This work was supported by the UK Medical Research Council (G0800578) and the German Doppelfeld Foundation (2008-2011), with its publishing being funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the University of Wurzburg (Open Access Publishing funding program).

Despite numerous previous fMRI studies, however, it remains open which spatial distribution of activity is sufficient to encode whether a stimulus is perceived as painful or not. In this study, we analyzed fMRI data from a perceptual decision-making task in which participants were exposed to near-threshold laser pulses. Using multivariate analyses on different spatial scales, we investigated the predictive capacity of fMRI data for decoding whether a stimulus had been perceived as painful. Our analysis yielded a rank order of brain regions: during pain anticipation, activity in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) afforded the most accurate trial-by-trial discrimination between painful and non-painful experiences; whereas during the actual stimulation, primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, anterior insula, dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and OFC were most discriminative. The most accurate prediction of pain perception from the stimulation period, however, was enabled by the combined activity in pain regions commonly referred to as the 'pain matrix'. Our results demonstrate that the neural representation of (near-threshold) pain is spatially distributed and can be best described at an intermediate spatial scale. In addition to its utility in establishing structure-function mappings, our approach affords trial-by-trial predictions and thus represents a step towards the goal of establishing an objective neuronal marker of pain perception.

For instance, classifiers are often trained and tested on trial-wise measurements, separately for each subject within a group. One important question is how classification outcomes observed in individual subjects can be generalized to the population from which the group was sampled. To address this question, this paper introduces novel statistical models that are guided by three desiderata. First, all models explicitly respect the hierarchical nature of the data, that is, they are mixed-effects models that simultaneously account for within-subjects (fixed-effects) and across-subjects (random-effects) variance components. Second, maximum-likelihood estimation is replaced by full Bayesian inference in order to enable natural regularization of the estimation problem and to afford conclusions in terms of posterior probability statements. Third, inference on classification accuracy is complemented by inference on the balanced accuracy, which avoids inflated accuracy estimates for imbalanced data sets. We introduce hierarchical models that satisfy these criteria and demonstrate their advantages over conventional methods using MCMC implementations for model inversion and model selection on both synthetic and empirical data. We envisage that our approach will improve the sensitivity and validity of statistical inference in future hierarchical classification studies.","[Brodersen, Kay H.; Mathys, Christoph; Daunizeau, Jean; Stephan, Klaas E.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Biomed Engn, TNU, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Brodersen, Kay H.; Mathys, Christoph; Daunizeau, Jean; Stephan, Klaas E.] Univ Zurich, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Brodersen, Kay H.; Mathys, Christoph; Chumbley, Justin R.; Daunizeau, Jean; Stephan, Klaas E.] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Lab Social & Neural Syst Res SNS, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Brodersen, Kay H.; Ong, Cheng Soon; Buhmann, Joachim M.] ETH, Dept Comp Sci, Machine Learning Lab, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Stephan, Klaas E.] UCL, Wellcome Trust Ctr Neuroimaging, London WC1N 3BG, England","Brodersen, KH (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Biomed Engn, TNU, Wilfriedstr 6, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.","BRODERSEN@BIOMED.EE.ETHZ.CH; CHMATHYS@ETHZ.CH; JUSTIN.CHUMBLEY@ECON.UZH.CH; J.DAUNIZEAU@FIL.ION.UCL.AC.UK; CHENGSOON.ONG@UNIMELB.EDU.AU; JBUHMANN@INF.ETHZ.CH; STEPHAN@BIOMED.EE.ETHZ.CH","Brodersen, Kay/B-6694-2013; Mathys, Christoph/D-5661-2014","Brodersen, Kay/0000-0002-7707-090X; Mathys, Christoph/0000-0003-4079-5453; Stephan, Klaas Enno/0000-0002-8594-9092","University Research Priority Program 'Foundations of Human Social Behaviour' at the University of Zurich; SystemsX.ch project 'Neurochoice'; NCCR 'Neural Plasticity'","This research was supported by the University Research Priority Program 'Foundations of Human Social Behaviour' at the University of Zurich (KHB, KES), by the SystemsX.ch project 'Neurochoice' (KHB, KES), and by the NCCR 'Neural Plasticity' (KES).

Supraliminal exposure was associated with greater activation in areas that were previously associated with sexual arousal (e.g. caudate nucleus and thalamus) as well as areas that were previously associated with control (e.g. orbitofrontal cortex and cingulate cortex). In contrast, subliminal exposure was mainly related to activation in areas previously associated with sexual arousal.

This was done under instructions that elicited either spontaneous trait inferences ('read carefully') or intentional trait inferences ('infer a trait'). The results revealed that when the behavioral descriptions violated earlier trait implications, regardless of instruction, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was more strongly recruited as well as the domain-general conflict network including the posterior medial frontal cortex (pmFC) and the right prefrontal cortex (rPFC). These latter two areas were more strongly activated under intentional than spontaneous instructions.

Participants in our MRI study predicted the likelihood that their favorite or least favorite team would win a football game. Consistent with expectations, favorite team trials were characterized by higher winning odds. Our data demonstrated activity in a cluster comprising parts of the left inferior occipital and fusiform gyri to distinguish between favorite and least favorite team trials. More importantly, functional connectivities of this cluster with the human reward system were specifically involved in the type of WT investigated in our study, thus supporting the idea of an attention bias generating WT. Prefrontal cortex activity also distinguished between the two teams. However, activity in this region and its functional connectivities with the human reward system were altogether unrelated to the degree of WT reflected in the participants' behavior and may rather be related to social identification, ensuring the affective context necessary for WT to arise.","[Aue, Tatjana] Univ Geneva, Swiss Ctr Affect Sci, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland; [Nusbaum, Howard C.; Cacioppo, John T.] Univ Chicago, Ctr Cognit & Social Neurosci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","Aue, T (reprint author), Univ Geneva, Swiss Ctr Affect Sci, 7 Rue Battoirs, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland.","tatjana.aue@unige.ch","","","National Institute of Mental Health [P50 MH72850]; John Templeton Foundation","This research was supported by National Institute of Mental Health Grant No. P50 MH72850 and the John Templeton Foundation.","","33","5","5","0","12","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

We used fMRI to explore how pubertal indicators (salivary concentrations of testosterone, oestradiol and DHEA; pubertal stage; menarcheal status) relate to brain activity during a social emotion task. Forty-two females aged 11.1 to 13.7 years underwent fMRI scanning while reading scenarios pertaining either to social emotions, which require the representation of another person's mental states, or to basic emotions, which do not. Pubertal stage and menarcheal status were used to assign girls to early or late puberty groups. Across the entire sample, the contrast between social versus basic emotion resulted in activity within the social brain network, including dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), the posterior superior temporal sulcus, and the anterior temporal cortex (ATC) in both hemispheres. Increased hormone levels (independent of age) were associated with higher left ATC activity during social emotion processing. More advanced age (independent of hormone levels) was associated with lower DMPFC activity during social emotion processing.

For example, understanding the word ""grasp"" elicits activation in the cortical motor network, that is, part of the neural substrate involved in planned and executing a grasping action. In the embodied literature, cortical motor activation during language comprehension is thought to reflect motor simulation underlying conceptual knowledge [note that outside the embodied framework, other explanations for the link between action and language are offered, e.g., Mahon, B. Z., & Caramazza, A. A critical look at the embodied cognition hypothesis and a new proposal for grouding conceptual content. Journal of Physiology, 102, 59-70, 2008; Hagoort, P. On Broca, brain, and binding: A new framework. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 9, 416-423, 2005]. Previous research has supported the view that the coupling between language and action is flexible, and reading an action-related word form is not sufficient for cortical motor activation [Van Dam, W. O., van Dijk, M., Bekkering, H., & Rueschemeyer, S.-A. Flexibility in embodied lexical-semantic representations. Human Brain Mapping, doi: 10.1002/hbm.21365, 2011]. The current study goes one step further by addressing the necessity of action-related word forms for motor activation during language comprehension. Subjects listened to indirect requests (IRs) for action during an fMRI session. IRs for action are speech acts in which access to an action concept is required, although it is not explicitly encoded in the language. For example, the utterance ""It is hot here!"" in a room with a window is likely to be interpreted as a request to open the window. However, the same utterance in a desert will be interpreted as a statement. The results indicate (1) that comprehension of IR sentences activates cortical motor areas reliably more than comprehension of sentences devoid of any implicit motor information. This is true despite the fact that IR sentences contain no lexical reference to action. (2) Comprehension of IR sentences also reliably activates substantial portions of the theory of mind network, known to be involved in making inferences about mental states of others. The implications of these findings for embodied theories of language are discussed.","[van Ackeren, Markus J.] Univ York, Dept Psychol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Casasanto, Daniel] New Sch Social Res, New York, NY 10011 USA; [Bekkering, Harold; Hagoort, Peter; Rueschemeyer, Shirley-Ann] Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Hagoort, Peter] Max Planck Inst Psycholinguist, Nijmegen, Netherlands","van Ackeren, MJ (reprint author), Univ York, Dept Psychol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.","M.vanAckeren@psych.york.ac.uk","Hagoort, Peter/B-7417-2012; Bekkering, Harold/A-6357-2009","","Nederlands Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk onderzoek Veni Grant","This research was supported by the Nederlands Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk onderzoek Veni Grant awarded to Shirley-Ann Rueschemeyer.","","46","31","31","2","51","MIT PRESS","CAMBRIDGE","55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA","0898-929X","","","J COGNITIVE NEUROSCI","J.

However, whether the same or different neural processes are involved in perceiving physical and social causality is unknown. Therefore, this study is focused on commonalities and differences in the neural correlates of causality perception in both contexts. During fMRI data-acquisition, participants judged causal relationships of objects in two types of animated video clips (physical/social) with similar manipulations of temporal and spatial stimulus characteristics. Four conditions were analyzed in a two-factorial design [physical causal (PC), physical non-causal (PNC), social causal (SC), social non-causal (SNC)]. We found that higher angles and longer time delays led to decreasing judgments of causality in the physical context, whereas the same manipulations led to increasing judgments in the social context. Instead of a common network for causal judgments (PC>PNC boolean AND SC>SNC), we found a reversed activation pattern for the factors context and judgment. PC and SNC [(PC>PNC) > (SC>SNC)] produced activations in the bilateral insula, the right angular and inferior frontal gyrus and the medial supplementary motor area. PNC and SC [(PC>PNC) < (SC>SNC)] produced activity in medial frontal, left superior temporal and anterior cingulate brain regions. Our data suggest, that the same brain regions contribute to the impression of physical and social causality. However, they demonstrate a reversed activation pattern that reflects the stimulus characteristics of the respective conditions. Thus, specific stimulus characteristics are crucial for the perception of causality. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Previous research has shown that decisions about moral dilemmas in which one person can be sacrificed to save multiple others do not consistently follow utilitarian principles. We hypothesized that this behavior can be explained by the potential victim's perceived humanness and an ensuing increase in vicarious emotions and emotional conflict during decision making. Using fMRI, we assessed neural activity underlying moral decisions that affected fictitious persons that had or had not been experimentally humanized. In implicit priming trials, participants either engaged in mentalizing about these persons (HUMANIZED condition) or not (NEUTRAL condition). In subsequent moral dilemmas, participants had to decide about sacrificing these persons' lives in order to save the lives of numerous others. Humanized persons were sacrificed less often, and the activation pattern during decisions about them indicated increased negative affect, emotional conflict, vicarious emotions, and behavioral control (pgACC/mOFC, anterior insula/IFG, aMCC and precuneus/PCC). Besides, we found enhanced effective connectivity between aMCC and anterior insula, which suggests increased emotion regulation during decisions affecting humanized victims. These findings highlight the importance of others' perceived humanness for prosocial behavior - with aversive affect and other-related concern when imagining harming more ""human-like'' persons acting against purely utilitarian decisions.","[Majdandzic, Jasminka; Bauer, Herbert; Engl, Elisabeth; Lamm, Claus] Univ Vienna, Social Cognit & Affect Neurosci Unit, Fac Psychol, Vienna, Austria; [Majdandzic, Jasminka; Windischberger, Christian; Moser, Ewald] Med Univ Vienna, Ctr Med Phys & Biomed Engn, Vienna, Austria","Majdandzic, J (reprint author), Univ Vienna, Social Cognit & Affect Neurosci Unit, Fac Psychol, Vienna, Austria.","jasminka.majdandzic@univie.ac.at; claus.lamm@univie.ac.at","Lamm, Claus/B-3357-2014; Moser, Ewald/B-3666-2013","Moser, Ewald/0000-0001-8278-9583; Engl, Elisabeth/0000-0002-1400-7858; Windischberger, Christian/0000-0002-9944-0190; Lamm, Claus/0000-0002-5422-0653","Austrian Federal Ministry of Defence and Sports, Vienna, Austria","This work was supported by a grant from the Austrian Federal Ministry of Defence and Sports, Vienna, Austria.

Recent research suggests that during action observation, activity in these neural regions can be modulated by membership in an ethnic group defined by physical differences. In this study we expanded upon previous research by matching physical similarity of two different social groups and investigating whether likability of an outgroup member modulates activity in neural regions involved in action observation. Seventeen Jewish subjects were familiarized with biographies of eight individuals, half of the individuals belonged to Neo-Nazi groups (dislikable) and half of which did not (likable). All subjects and actors in the stimuli were Caucasian and physically similar. The subjects then viewed videos of actors portraying the characters performing simple motor actions (e. g. grasping a water bottle and raising it to the lips), while undergoing fMRI. Using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), we found that a classifier trained on brain activation patterns successfully discriminated between the likable and dislikable action observation conditions within the right ventral premotor cortex. These data indicate that the spatial pattern of activity in action observation related neural regions is modulated by likability even when watching a simple action such as reaching for a cup. These findings lend further support for the notion that social factors such as interpersonal liking modulate perceptual processing in motor-related cortices.","[Sobhani, Mona; Fox, Glenn R.] Univ So Calif, Grad Program Neurosci, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Sobhani, Mona; Fox, Glenn R.; Kaplan, Jonas; Aziz-Zadeh, Lisa] Brain & Creat Inst Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Kaplan, Jonas] Univ So Calif, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Aziz-Zadeh, Lisa] Univ So Calif, Div Occupat Sci & Occupat Therapy, Los Angeles, CA USA","Sobhani, M (reprint author), Univ So Calif, Grad Program Neurosci, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.","mssobhani@gmail.com","","","Brain and Creativity Institute; Division of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy at the University of Southern California","This research was supported by the Brain and Creativity Institute and the Division of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy at the University of Southern California.

Social psychologists have long debated whether the information that perceivers have about categories of people-i.e. stereotypes-may be a unique form of semantics. Here, we examine this question against well-established findings regarding the neural basis of semantics, which suggest that two brain regions-left inferior frontal gyrus and inferotemporal cortex-are critical for general semantic knowledge. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, participants answered questions about their knowledge of both non-social and social categories. We reasoned that if stereotypes are a typical form of semantic knowledge, then these same regions should subserve the activation and retrieval of stereotypes. Inconsistent with this possibility, left inferior frontal gyrus and inferotemporal cortex were activated only during non-social category judgments. Instead, judgments of social categories were associated with regions frequently linked to social cognition, including medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate, bilateral temporoparietal junction and anterior temporal cortex. Together, these results suggest that social stereotypes should be considered distinct from other forms of semantic knowledge, and may have more in common with representing mental states than retrieving semantic knowledge about objects and non-human living things.","[Contreras, Juan Manuel; Banaji, Mahzarin R.; Mitchell, Jason P.] Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Contreras, JM (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, NW Sci Bldg,52 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.","jmcontre@wjh.harvard.edu","","","United States Department of Education; National Science Foundation [BCS 0642448]","The authors thank David Amodio, Regan Bernhard, Dave Johnson, Eshin Jolly, Adam Lambert, Steve Lehr, Brandi Newell, Jess Schirmer, Diana Tamir, Jennifer Tao, Emma Templeton, Adam Waytz for advice and assistance.

We investigated the relationship between extraversion and neuroticism and emotional perception using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a group of 23 young, healthy women. Using a parametric modulation approach, we examined how the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal varied with the participants' ratings of arousal and valence, and whether levels of extraversion and neuroticism were related to these modulations. In particular, we wished to test Eysenck's biological theory of personality, which links high extraversion to lower levels of reticulothalamic-cortical arousal, and neuroticism to increased reactivity of the limbic system and stronger reactions to emotional arousal. Individuals high in neuroticism demonstrated reduced sustained activation in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and attenuated valence processing in the right temporal lobe while viewing emotional images, but an increased BOLD response to emotional arousal in the right medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). These results support Eysenck's theory, as well as our hypothesis that high levels of neuroticism are associated with attenuated reward processing. Extraversion was inversely related to arousal processing in the right cerebellum, but positively associated with arousal processing in the right insula, indicating that the relationship between extraversion and arousal is not as simple as that proposed by Eysenck.","[Kehoe, Elizabeth G.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Trinity Coll Inst Neurosci, Lloyd Inst, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Kehoe, Elizabeth G.; Bokde, Arun L.

However, the functional role of the fusiform gyrus in face processing related to high-level social cognition remains unclear. The current study assessed the functional role of individually defined fusiform face area (FFA) in the processing of self-face physical properties and self-face identity. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to monitor neural responses to rapidly presented face stimuli drawn from morph continua between self-face (Morph 100%) and a gender-matched friend's face (Morph 0%) in a face recognition task. Contrasting Morph 100% versus Morph 60% that differed in self-face physical properties but were both recognized as the self uncovered neural activity sensitive to self-face physical properties in the left FFA. Contrasting Morphs 50% that were recognized as the self versus a friend on different trials revealed neural modulations associated with self-face identity in the right FFA. Moreover, the right FFA activity correlated with the frequency of recognizing Morphs 50% as the self.

However, the computational and neurobiological mechanisms by which it affects behavior remain unknown. We studied this issue using an fMRI task in which human participants used cognitive regulation to upregulate and downregulate their cravings for foods at the time of choice. We found that activity in both ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) correlated with value. We also found evidence that two distinct regulatory mechanisms were at work: value modulation, which operates by changing the values assigned to foods in vmPFC and dlPFC at the time of choice, and behavioral control modulation, which operates by changing the relative influence of the vmPFC and dlPFC value signals on the action selection process used to make choices. In particular, during downregulation, activation decreased in the value-sensitive region of dlPFC (indicating value modulation) but not in vmPFC, and the relative contribution of the two value signals to behavior shifted toward the dlPFC (indicating behavioral control modulation). The opposite pattern was observed during upregulation: activation increased in vmPFC but not dlPFC, and the relative contribution to behavior shifted toward the vmPFC. Finally, ventrolateral PFC and posterior parietal cortex were more active during both upregulation and downregulation, and were functionally connected with vmPFC and dlPFC during cognitive regulation, which suggests that they help to implement the changes to the decision-making circuitry generated by cognitive regulation.","[Hutcherson, Cendri A.; Rangel, Antonio] CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Plassmann, Hilke] INSEAD, Dept Mkt, F-77300 Fontainebleau, France; [Plassmann, Hilke] Ecole Normale Super, INSERM, Cognit Neurosci Lab, F-75005 Paris, France; [Gross, James J.] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Hutcherson, CA (reprint author), CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, MC 228-77, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.","chutcher@hss.caltech.edu","","Hutcherson, Cendri/0000-0002-4441-4809","National Science Foundation [SES-0851408, SES-0926544, SES-0850840]; National Institutes of Health [R01 AA018736]; Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation","This work was supported by National Science Foundation Grants SES-0851408, SES-0926544, and SES-0850840, National Institutes of Health Grant R01 AA018736, and The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.

Differences in reward-related behaviors have been linked to either temporary or permanent organizational influences of gonadal hormones on the mesolimbic dopamine system and reward-related activation. Still, little is known about the association between biological gender and the neural underpinnings of the ability to resist reward-related impulses. Here we assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging which neural processes enable men and women to successfully control their desire for immediate reward when this is required by a higher-order goal (i.e., during a 'desire-reason dilemma'; Dielchof and Gruber, 2010). Thirty-two participants (16 females) were closely matched for age, personality characteristics (e.g., novelty seeking) and behavioral performance in the 'desire-reason task'. On the neural level, men and women showed similarities in the general response of the nucleus accumbens and of the ventral tegmental area to predictors of immediate reward, but they differed in additional brain mechanisms that enabled self-controlled decisions against the preference for immediate reward. Firstly, men exhibited a stronger reduction of activation in the ventral pallidum, putamen, temporal pole and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex during the 'desire-reason dilemma'. Secondly, connectivity analyses revealed a significant change in the direction of the connectivity between anteroventral prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens during decisions counteracting the reward-related impulse when comparing men and women. Together, these findings support the view of a sexual dimorphism that manifested in the recruitment of gender-specific neural resources during the successful deployment of self-control.

Critics have argued that situating the mind in a brain scan risks essentializing contested social and psychiatric categories, encourages deterministic perspectives, and diverts attention from non-biological ways of understanding the mind. Here, I review these critical discourses and ask whether they are reflected in popular media, through a discourse analysis of print and online reports of functional neuroimaging research deriving primarily from the United Kingdom. In contrast to earlier studies, I found diverse challenges to the expertise of the scanner, ranging from explicit polemic to assertions of lay expertise. Brain images themselves were often manipulated, mislabelled or omitted in favour of photographic representations of mental function, posing new questions about the rhetorical power of the scan. These findings caution against premature conclusions concerning the reductive impact of popularized neuroimages, but I also argue for caution regarding the reach and novelty of the critical engagements I observed. Finally, I argue that qualitative analysis of media texts is essential to understanding the developing discourse surrounding functional neuroimaging, and discuss possible implications for science communication and public engagement practice.

However, little is known about white matter abnormalities under the condition of AN. To comprehensively assess the microstructural integrity of white matter pathways in women with anorexia nervosa, we performed voxel-based Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). 21 women with AN according to DSM-IV criteria (9 of them recovered) and 20 female age-matched healthy control subjects were enrolled in the study. The patients had a mean body mass index of 17.2 kg/m(2) (controls: 19.6 kg/m(2)). High resolution T1 images (MP-RAGE) and DTI were performed on a 3 T Siemens-scanner. Images were pre-processed and analyzed using a modified protocol for DTI in SPM2. Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were compared using t-tests (p < 0.05. corrected). Compared with controls, AN patients showed bilateral reductions of FA maps in the posterior thalamic radiation which includes the optic radiation, and the left mediodorsal thalamus. Our study is limited by the small sample size and its cross-sectional design. A longitudinal design with the same individuals assessed when acutely ill and recovered is warranted for future studies. For the first time, the findings of our DTI study identified disturbances of associational and commissural fibers in the bilateral occipitotemporal white matter. The results help narrowing the prevailing biological models of AN by suggesting that body image distortion is related to microstructural alterations of white matter tracts connecting the extrastriate visual cortex with other brain regions involved in body perception.

Modulation from the dopamine system is thought to be critical for the gating of information during working memory. Given the known relationships between executive aging, cognition, and dopamine, this study aims to explore the neurobiology underlying age-related changes in working memory updating using fMRI with healthy subjects from across the adult age spectrum. Our results indicate that older age is associated with poorer performance, reduced meso-cortico-striatal activation, and reduced functional coupling between the caudate and the VLPFC during the updating task. Additionally, caudate activation is associated with improved accuracy and VLPFC activation with faster reaction times in the full sample. Thus, older subjects' under-recruitment of and reduced functional coupling between these regions may specifically underlie age-related changes in working memory updating. These results are consistent with computational models of executive cognition and dopamine-mediated age-related cognitive decline. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

It has remained unclear which attributes of UEs were responsible for the observed effects in imaging experiments. In this study, we investigated what factors of UEs influence brain activity. In a training paradigm, we systematically varied the uniqueness of semantic associations, the presence/absence of a proper name, and the number of semantic associations to determine factors modulating activity in regions subserving the processing of UEs. We found that a conjunction of unique semantic information and proper names modulated activity within a section of the left ATL. Overall, the processing of UEs involved a wider left-hemispheric cortical network. Within these regions, brain activity was significantly affected by the unique semantic attributes especially in the presence of a proper name, but we could not find evidence for an effect of the number of semantic associations.

The present work demonstrates that attentional control regulates this effect. In three studies, disgust was induced. In an unrelated part of the studies, participants then judged a moral transgression. Disgust resulted in more severe moral judgments when attentional control (either measured by means of individual predisposition or manipulated with experimental control) was weak as opposed to strong (Studies 1-3). Findings further showed that attentional control mediated the positive relation between the intensity of participants' disgust responses and the severity of their moral judgments (Study 2). Moreover, attentional control has its effects through the regulation of affective processing (Study 3).

VPL is often highly specific for a visual feature presented during training. Such specificity is observed in behavioral tuning function changes with the highest improvement centered on the trained feature and was originally thought to be evidence for changes in the early visual system associated with VPL. However, results of neurophysiological studies have been highly controversial concerning whether the plasticity underlying VPL occurs within the visual cortex. The controversy may be partially due to the lack of observation of neural tuning function changes in multiple visual areas in association with VPL. Here using human subjects we systematically compared behavioral tuning function changes after global motion detection training with decoded tuning function changes for 8 visual areas using pattern classification analysis on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals. We found that the behavioral tuning function changes were extremely highly correlated to decoded tuning function changes only in V3A, which is known to be highly responsive to global motion with human subjects.

Dual process theory assumes that, in such situations, decision making relies on either a rapid intuitive, automated or a slower rational processing system. However, it still remains elusive how personality factors or professional requirements might modulate the decision process and the underlying neural mechanisms. Since decision making is a key task of managers, we hypothesized that managers, facing higher pressure for frequent and rapid decisions than non-managers, prefer the heuristic, automated decision strategy in contrast to non-managers. Such different strategies may, in turn, rely on different neural systems. We tested managers and non-managers in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study using a forced-choice paradigm on word-pairs. Managers showed subcortical activation in the head of the caudate nucleus, and reduced hemodynamic response within the cortex. In contrast, non-managers revealed the opposite pattern. With the head of the caudate nucleus being an initiating component for process automation, these results supported the initial hypothesis, hinting at automation during decisions in managers. More generally, the findings reveal how different professional requirements might modulate cognitive decision processing.","[Caspers, Svenja; Heim, Stefan; Amunts, Katrin; Zilles, Karl] Res Ctr Julich, Inst Neurosci & Med, Julich, Germany; [Heim, Stefan; Amunts, Katrin; Zilles, Karl] Julich Aachen Res Alliance, BRAIN, Julich, Germany; [Heim, Stefan; Amunts, Katrin] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Psychiat Psychotherapy & Psychosomat, D-52062 Aachen, Germany; [Heim, Stefan] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Neurol, Sect Neurol Cognit Res, Aachen, Germany; [Lucas, Marc G.; Stephan, Egon] Univ Cologne, Dept Psychol, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Lucas, Marc G.] Fernuniv, Dept Business Studies Leadership & Org, Hagen, Germany; [Fischer, Lorenz] Univ Cologne, Inst Econ & Social Psychol, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Zilles, Karl] Univ Dusseldorf, C&O Vogt Inst Brain Res, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany","Caspers, S (reprint author), Res Ctr Julich, Inst Neurosci & Med, Julich, Germany.","s.caspers@fz-juelich.de","Heim, Stefan/G-6348-2013; Zilles, Karl/J-9704-2013; Caspers, Svenja/H-9346-2013","Heim, Stefan/0000-0002-5818-8355; Zilles, Karl/0000-0001-9296-9959; Caspers, Svenja/0000-0001-5083-4669; Zilles, Karl/0000-0002-4705-4175; Amunts, Katrin/0000-0001-5828-0867","Initiative and Networking Fund of the Helmholtz Association within the Helmholtz Alliance on Systems Biology (Human Brain Model); Helmholtz Alliance for Mental Health in an Aging Society; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01GW0613]","This work was supported by the Initiative and Networking Fund of the Helmholtz Association within the Helmholtz Alliance on Systems Biology (Human Brain Model, K.Z.), the Helmholtz Alliance for Mental Health in an Aging Society (K.Z., K.

However, cognitive neuroscience studies, partially because of methodological constraints, have remained largely ""perceiver-centric"": focusing on the abilities, motivations, and goals of social perceivers while largely ignoring interpersonal effects. Here, we address this knowledge gap by examining the neural bases of perceiving emotionally expressive and inexpressive social ""targets."" Sixteen perceivers were scanned using fMRI while they watched targets discussing emotional autobiographical events. Perceivers continuously rated each target's emotional state or eye-gaze direction. The effects of targets' emotional expressivity on perceiver's brain activity depended on task set: when perceivers explicity attended to targets' emotions, expressivity predicted activity in neural structures-including medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex-associated with drawing inferences about mental states. When perceivers instead attended to targets' eye-gaze, target expressivity predicted activity in regions-including somatosensory cortex, fusiform gyrus, and motor cortex-associated with monitoring sensorimotor states and biological motion. These findings suggest that expressive targets affect information processing in manner that depends on perceivers' goals. More broadly, these data provide an early step toward understanding the neural bases of interpersonal social cognition.","[Zaki, Jamil] Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Weber, Jochen; Ochsner, Kevin] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10027 USA","Zaki, J (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, 33 Kirkland St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.","zaki@wjh.harvard.edu","","","Autism Speaks Grant [4787]; NIDA [1R01DA022541-01]","This work was supported by Autism Speaks Grant 4787(to Jamil Zaki) and NIDA Grant 1R01DA022541-01 (to Kevin Ochsner).","","66","6","6","2","24","FRONTIERS RES FOUND","LAUSANNE","PO BOX 110, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND","1662-5161","","","FRONT HUM NEUROSCI","Front.

However, the brain mechanisms underlying this process, especially falsification process which is important in daily life, but especially crucial to scientific reasoning and research is not as yet completely clear. Therefore, in the present study, we used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the neural bases of the falsification process in testing the validity of a conditional statement as used in Wason's (1966) selection task. Our fMRI results showed that: (1) compared with the baseline condition, both Falsification (by using Modus Ponens, and Modus Tollens) and Non-Falsification conditions (affirming the consequent, and denying the antecedent) activated the left frontal areas (BA44/45, or BA6), and basal ganglia, the areas previously found in the rule-guided conditional reasoning operations; the parietal area (BA40, BA7) for recruiting cognitive resources to represent and maintain the different evidential information in working memory. (2) The left middle frontal gyrus (BA9) and cerebellum were shown to be activated in the contrast of Falsification condition versus Non-Falsification condition and in the contrast of MT versus Non-Falsification condition. These results indicated that the left middle frontal gyrus (BA9) might be the key brain region involved in the falsification process of conditional statement for which abstracting and integrating logical relationships, and inhibiting the distraction of the irrelevant information were the essential processes. Moreover, the cerebellum was found to be responsible for constructing an internal working model. In addition, our brain imaging results might support the dual-process theory of reasoning.

This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural mechanism mediating the relationship between inhibitory control and emotional devaluation. Participants performed two tasks: (i) a Go/No-Go task in response to faces and (ii) a trustworthiness rating task involving the previously seen faces. No-Go faces were rated as significantly less trustworthy than Go faces. By examining brain activations during Task 1, behavioral measures and brain activations obtained in Task 2 could be predicted. Specifically, activity in brain areas during Task 1 associated with (i) executive control and response suppression (i.e. lateral prefrontal cortex) and (ii) affective responses and value representation (i.e. orbitofrontal cortex), systematically covaried with behavioral ratings and amygdala activity obtained during Task 2.

Participants were presented with images of stigmatized (e.g. homeless people) or non-stigmatized (e.g. a man holding a gun) social targets while undergoing fMRI and were asked either to maintain or regulate their emotional response. Their implicit bias toward these stigmatized group members was also measured. Analyses were conducted in both, an event-related fashion, considering the event to be the onset of regulation, and in a blocked-design fashion, considering the sustained activity throughout the 8-s regulatory period. In the event-related (onset) analyses, participants showed more activity throughout the prefrontal cortex when initiating a regulatory response to stigmatized as compared with non-stigmatized images. This neural activity was positively correlated with their implicit bias. Interestingly, in the block (sustained) analyses, general emotion regulation elicited a more widespread pattern of neural activity as compared with stigma regulation. This activity was largely posterior, suggesting that general emotion regulation may engage more visuo-spatial processing as compared with stigma regulation. These findings suggest that regulating negative affect toward stigmatized targets may occur relatively more quickly than regulating negative affect toward non-stigmatized targets.","[Krendl, Anne C.; Ambady, Nalini] Tufts Univ, Dept Psychol, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Kensinger, Elizabeth A.] Boston Coll, Dept Psychol, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA","Krendl, AC (reprint author), Tufts Univ, Dept Psychol, 490 Boston Ave, Medford, MA 02155 USA.","anne.krendl@tufts.edu","","Kensinger, Elizabeth/0000-0003-1940-231X","National Institutes of Health [R01 MH070833-02]; NRSA [1F32AG034039]","The authors wish to thank Tammy Moran at the Harvard Center for Brain Sciences, Rebecca Mohr and Cindy Ko for assistance with data collection.

Strikingly little is, however, known about how gestures and expressions of two interacting humans are processed in the observer's brain, since the study of social cues has mostly focused on the perception of solitary humans. To investigate the neural underpinnings of the third-person view of social interaction, we studied brain activations of subjects who observed two humans either facing toward or away from each other. Activations within the amygdala, posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) were sensitive to the interactional position of the observed people and distinguished humans facing toward from humans facing away. The amygdala was most sensitive to face-to-face interaction and did not differentiate the humans facing away from the pixelated control figures, whereas the pSTS dissociated both human stimuli from the pixel figures. The results of the amygdala reactivity suggest that, in addition to regulating interpersonal distance towards oneself, the amygdala is involved in the assessment of the proximity between two other persons.

Prior neuroimaging studies have demonstrated the role of the neural default network in self-referential and empathic processing. However, how racial identification affects neural processing of social information remains unknown. Here, we examined the effect of racial identification on neural response related to social perception among African American and Caucasian American individuals using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Our results demonstrate that degree of racial identification predicts activity within cortical midline structures of the default network in response to viewing racial ingroup, relative to outgroup members, and activity within the medial temporal lobe subsystem of the default network in response to viewing racial outgroup, relative to ingroup members. Broadly, our findings suggest that the strength of racial identification is associated with differential recruitment of neural and cognitive processes to understand and respond to other people within and outside of one's racial group.

This view has been indirectly supported by data demonstrating similar patterns of brain activity - most importantly, in the anterior insula - during both interoception and emotion elicitation. However, no study has directly compared these two phenomena within participants, leaving it unclear whether interoception and emotional experience truly share the same functional neural architecture. The current study addressed this gap in knowledge by examining the neural convergence of these two phenomena within the same population. In one task, participants monitored their own heartbeat: in another task they watched emotional video clips and rated their own emotional responses to the videos. Consistent with prior research, heartbeat monitoring engaged a circumscribed area spanning insular cortex and adjacent inferior frontal operculum. Critically, this interoception-related cluster also was engaged when participants rated their own emotion, and activity here correlated with the trial-by-trial intensity of participants' emotional experience. These findings held across both group-level and individual participant-level approaches to localizing interoceptive cortex. Together, these data further clarify the functional role of the anterior insula and provide novel insights about the connection between bodily awareness and emotion. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Although several brain regions have recently been associated with complex cognitive control processes, surprisingly little is known about the structural correlates underlying cognitive control processes involved in social interactions. In the present study we used gray matter voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to investigate structural brain correlates of individual performance differences in a social Simon task. Here, two people share a Simon task, which requires each participant to respond to only one of two possible stimuli, rendering the paradigm a go-nogo task, so that a Simon effect - known as the Social Simon Effect (SSE) - is observable across both participants. Using a whole brain approach, we found that inter-individual differences in the SSE are negatively correlated with gray matter (GM) volume of the medial frontal cortex (MFC). The present data indicate that individuals with larger MFC GM volume were those with better conflict resolution in a social Simon task and vice versa. This brain-behavior relationship between cognitive control processes and individual GM volume differences might help to improve our understanding of social interactions in joint task performance.

The neural mechanism which underlies this effect is however unknown. It has been proposed that testosterone increases social vigilance via neuropeptide systems in the amygdala, augmenting communication between the amygdala and the brain stem. However, testosterone also affects connectivity between the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the amygdala, which could subsequently lead to increased vigilance by reduced top-down control over the amygdala. Here, in a placebo-controlled testosterone administration study with 16 young women, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging to get more insights into neural mechanisms whereby testosterone acts on trust. Several cortical systems, among others the OFC, are involved in the evaluation of facial trustworthiness. Testosterone administration decreased functional connectivity between amygdala and the OFC during judgments of unfamiliar faces, and also increased amygdala responses specifically to the faces that were rated as untrustworthy. Finally, connectivity between the amygdala and the brain stem was not affected by testosterone administration. Although speculative, a neurobiological explanation for these findings is that in uncertain social situations, testosterone induces sustained decoupling between OFC and amygdala by a prefrontal-dopaminergic mechanism, subsequently resulting in more vigilant responses of the amygdala to signals of untrustworthiness.

Emotional information can be expressed at verbal and nonverbal levels. If the verbal message contradicts the nonverbal expression, usually the nonverbal information is perceived as being more authentic, revealing the ""true feelings"" of the speaker. The present fMRI study investigated the cerebral integration of verbal (sentences expressing the emotional state of the speaker) and nonverbal (facial expressions and tone of voice) emotional signals using ecologically valid audiovisual stimulus material. More specifically, cerebral activation associated with the relative impact of nonverbal information on judging the affective state of a speaker (individual nonverbal dominance index, INDI) was investigated. Perception of nonverbally expressed emotions was associated with bilateral activation within the amygdala, fusiform face area (FFA), temporal voice area (TVA), and the posterior temporal cortex as well as in the midbrain and left inferior orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)/left insula. Verbally conveyed emotions were linked to increased responses bilaterally in the TVA. Furthermore, the INDI correlated with responses in the left amygdala elicited by nonverbal and verbal emotional stimuli. Correlation of the INDI with the activation within the medial OFC was observed during the processing of communicative signals. These results suggest that individuals with a higher degree of nonverbal dominance have an increased sensitivity not only to nonverbal but to emotional stimuli in general. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We investigated age-related differences in the influence of facial emotion on brain activation when an action had to be withheld, focusing on a developmental period characterized by rapid social-emotional and cognitive change. Groups of kindergarten and young school-aged children and a group of young adults performed a modified Go/Nogo task. Response cues were preceded by happy or angry faces. After controlling for task performance, left orbitofrontal regions discriminated trials with happy vs. angry faces in children but not in adults when a response was withheld, and this effect decreased parametrically with age group. Age-related changes in prefrontal responsiveness to facial expression were not observed when an action was required, nor did this region show age-related activation changes with the demand to withhold a response in general. Such results reveal age-related differences in prefrontal activation that are specific to stimulus valence and depend on the action required. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In the latter case striatal activity reflects extrinsic reward processing, while in the former, striatal activity reflects the intrinsically rewarding effects of performing well. There can be a ""hidden cost of reward"", which is a detrimental effect of extrinsic on intrinsic reward value. This raises the question how these two types of reward interact. To address this, we applied a monetary incentive delay task: in all trials participants received feedback depending on their performance. In half of the trials they could additionally receive monetary reward if they performed well. This resulted in high performance trials, which were monetarily rewarded and high performance trials that were not. This made it possible to dissociate the neural correlates of performance feedback from the neural correlates of monetary reward that comes with high performance. Performance feedback alone elicits activation increases in the ventral striatum. This activation increases due to additional monetary reward. Neural response in the dorsal striatum on the other hand is only significantly increased by feedback when a monetary incentive is present. The quality of performance does not significantly influence dorsal striatum activity. In conclusion, our results indicate that the dorsal striatum is primarily sensitive to optional or actually received external rewards, whereas the ventral striatum may be coding intrinsic reward due to positive performance feedback. Thus the ventral striatum is suggested to be involved in the processing of intrinsically motivated behavior. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Participants' brain activity was measured with functional MRI while they had to categorize social, in-group and out-group words and non-social, living and non-living words. The results showed that a network of brain regions previously identified as the 'social brain', including the cortical midline structures, tempo-parietal junction and the anterior temporal gyrus showed enhanced activation for social words versus non-social words. Crucially, the processing of in-group words compared to the out-group words activated a specific network including the ventral medial prefrontal and anterior and dorsal cingulate cortex.

Previous behavioral studies have indicated that many gamers identify more strongly with their avatar than with their biological self. Through their avatar, gamers develop social networks and learn new social-cognitive skills. The cognitive neurosciences have yet to identify the neural processes that underlie self-identification with these virtual agents. We applied functional neuroimaging to 22 long-term online gamers and 21 nongaming controls, while they rated personality traits of self, avatar, and familiar others. Strikingly, neuroimaging data revealed greater avatar-referential cortical activity in the left inferior parietal lobe, a region associated with self-identification from a third-person perspective. The magnitude of this brain activity correlated positively with the propensity to incorporate external body enhancements into one's bodily identity. Avatar-referencing furthermore recruited greater activity in the rostral anterior cingulate gyrus, suggesting relatively greater emotional self-involvement with one's avatar. Post-scanning behavioral data revealed superior recognition memory for avatar relative to others. Interestingly, memory for avatar positively covaried with play duration. These findings significantly advance our knowledge about the brain's plasticity to self-identify with virtual agents and the human cognitive-affective potential to live and learn in virtual worlds.","[Ganesh, Shanti; van Schie, Hein T.; Wigboldus, Daniel H.

Two separate effects result from this self memory facilitation: self-reference effect and self-descriptiveness effect in memory. Self-reference effect denotes that information processed with reference to the self is better remembered than information processed with reference to others, whereas self-descriptiveness effect indicates that items judged to be self-relevant is remembered better than items judged not to be relevant to self during self-reference task. Although there is a compelling connection between self-reference effect in memory and self mentalization processes indexed by the medial prefrontal activity, the underlying mechanisms of the self-descriptiveness effect in memory have remained underspecified. In the present fMRI study, we used a subsequent memory paradigm to examine the neural correlates of self-descriptiveness and self-reference effect in memory. Participants encoded personality traits while performing self-reference and other-reference task (judged the descriptiveness of the traits to themselves or a famous person Bruce Lee), and then were given a test of recognition memory outside the scanner. It is revealed that the hippocampal activity corresponded with self-descriptiveness effect in memory, but the activity of the medial prefrontal cortex and perirhinal cortex related to self-reference effect in memory.

This form of learning is often assumed to require simulation of the other by direct recruitment of one's own valuation process to model the other's process. However, the cognitive and neural mechanism of simulation learning is not known. Using behavior, modeling, and fMRI, we show that simulation involves two learning signals in a hierarchical arrangement. A simulated-other's reward prediction error processed in ventromedial prefrontal cortex mediated simulation by direct recruitment, being identical for valuation of the self and simulated-other. However, direct recruitment was insufficient for learning, and also required observation of the other's choices to generate a simulated-other's action prediction error encoded in dorsomedial/dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings show that simulation uses a core prefrontal circuit for modeling the other's valuation to generate prediction and an adjunct circuit for tracking behavioral variation to refine prediction.","[Suzuki, Shinsuke; Harasawa, Norihiro; Nakahara, Hiroyuki] RIKEN, Brain Sci Inst, Lab Integrated Theoret Neurosci, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Ueno, Kenichi; Cheng, Kang] RIKEN, Brain Sci Inst, Support Unit Funct Magnet Resonance Imaging, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Gardner, Justin L.] RIKEN, Brain Sci Inst, Gardner Res Unit, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Cheng, Kang] RIKEN, Brain Sci Inst, Lab Cognit Brain Mapping, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Ichinohe, Noritaka] Natl Ctr Neurol & Psychiat, Natl Inst Neurosci, Dept Ultrastruct Res, Kodaira, Tokyo 1878502, Japan; [Haruno, Masahiko] NICT, Ctr Informat & Neural Networks, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Nakahara, Hiroyuki] Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Computat Intelligence & Syst Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268503, Japan","Nakahara, H (reprint author), RIKEN, Brain Sci Inst, Lab Integrated Theoret Neurosci, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan.","hiro@brain.riken.jp","Cheng, Kang/A-6448-2016; Suzuki, Shinsuke/A-8254-2013; Nakahara, Hiroyuki/N-5411-2015","Nakahara, Hiroyuki/0000-0001-6891-1175; Gardner, Justin/0000-0003-2220-5050","KAKENHI [21300129, 20020034]","This work was supported by KAKENHI grants 21300129 and 20020034 (H.N.).

Emotions triggered by the virtues and excellences of others have been largely ignored. Using fMRI, we investigated the neural basis of two ""other-praising"" emotions - Moral Elevation (a response to witnessing acts of moral beauty), and Admiration (which we restricted to admiration for physical skill). Methodology/Principal Findings: Ten participants viewed the same nine video clips. Three clips elicited moral elevation, three elicited admiration, and three were emotionally neutral. We then performed pair-wise voxel-by-voxel correlations of the BOLD signal between individuals for each video clip and a separate resting-state run. We observed a high degree of inter-subject synchronization, regardless of stimulus type, across several brain regions during free-viewing of videos. Videos in the elevation condition evoked significant inter-subject synchronization in brain regions previously implicated in self-referential and interoceptive processes, including the medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and insula. The degree of synchronization was highly variable over the course of the videos, with the strongest synchrony occurring during portions of the videos that were independently rated as most emotionally arousing. Synchrony in these same brain regions was not consistently observed during the admiration videos, and was absent for the neutral videos. Conclusions/Significance: Results suggest that the neural systems supporting moral elevation are remarkably consistent across subjects viewing the same emotional content. We demonstrate that model-free techniques such as inter-subject synchronization may be a useful tool for studying complex, context dependent emotions such as self-transcendent emotion.","[Englander, Zoe A.; Haidt, Jonathan; Morris, James P.] Univ Virginia, Dept Psychol, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA","Englander, ZA (reprint author), Univ Virginia, Dept Psychol, Gilmer Hall, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.","jpmorris@virginia.edu","Haidt, Jonathan/B-2835-2013","","National Institute of Mental Health Pathway to Independence Award [R00MH079617]","JP Morris was supported by a National Institute of Mental Health Pathway to Independence Award, R00MH079617.

In this Hypothesis, we outline a theoretical framework and an integrative research approach to the study of social influences on the brain and genetic moderators of such effects. First, we review neuroimaging evidence linking social influence and conformity to the brain's reward system. We next review neuroimaging evidence linking social punishment (exclusion) to brain systems involved in the experience of pain, as well as evidence linking exclusion to conformity. We suggest that genetic variants that increase sensitivity to social cues may predispose individuals to be more sensitive to either social rewards or punishments (or potentially both), which in turn increases conformity and susceptibility to normative social influences more broadly. To this end, we review evidence for genetic moderators of neurochemical responses in the brain, and suggest ways in which genes and pharmacology may modulate sensitivity to social influences. We conclude by proposing an integrative imaging genetics approach to the study of brain mediators and genetic modulators of a variety of social influences on human attitudes, beliefs, and actions.","[Falk, Emily B.] Univ Michigan, Dept Commun Studies, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA; [Falk, Emily B.] Univ Michigan, Inst Social Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA; [Way, Baldwin M.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Psychol, Columbus, OH 43201 USA; [Way, Baldwin M.] Ohio State Univ, Inst Behav Med Res, Columbus, OH 43201 USA; [Falk, Emily B.; Jasinska, Agnes J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Psychol, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA","Falk, EB (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept Commun Studies, 426 Thompson St, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA.","ebfalk@umich.edu; way.37@osu.edu","","","University of Michigan Injury Center","The authors wish to thank Steve Cole for helpful discussion of ideas outlined in this manuscript, as well as Francis Tinney and Matthew Brook O'Donnell for assistance with manuscript preparation.

Interestingly, this emerging Neuroscience of Social Interactions (NSI) field brings up challenges which resemble important ones in the field of Brain-Computer Interfaces( BCI). Importantly, these challenges go beyond common objectives such as the eventual use of BCI and NSI protocols in the clinical domain or common interests pertaining to the use of online neurophysiological techniques and algorithms. Common fundamental challenges are now apparent and one can argue that a crucial one is to develop computational models of brain processes relevant to human interactions with an adaptive agent, whether human or artificial. Coupled with neuroimaging data, such models have proved promising in revealing the neural basis and mental processes behind social interactions. Similar models could help BCI to move from well-performing but offline static machines to reliable online adaptive agents. This emphasizes a social perspective to BCI, which is not limited to a computational challenge but extends to all questions that arise when studying the brain in interaction with its environment.","[Mattout, Jeremie] Lyon Neurosci Res Ctr, Brain Dynam & Cognit Team, INSERM, CNRS,UMR5292,U1028, Lyon, France; [Mattout, Jeremie] Univ Lyon 1, F-69365 Lyon, France","Mattout, J (reprint author), CHS Le Vinatier, Lyon Neurosci Res Ctr, INSERM 1028, Equipe Bertrand, 95 Blvd Pinel, F-69500 Lyon, France.","jeremie.mattout@inserm.fr","Mattout, Jeremie/I-6417-2017","Mattout, Jeremie/0000-0003-2659-6984","French ANR-DEFIS [ANR-09-EMER-002]","Jeremie Mattout was funded by the French ANR-DEFIS program under the grant ANR-09-EMER-002 in the context of the Co-Adapt BCI project.

As important is a more primitive nonlinguistic mode of communication acting in parallel with linguistic processes and driving our decisions to a much higher degree than is generally suspected. Amongst the ""honest signals"" that influence our behavior is perceived vocal attractiveness. Not only does vocal attractiveness reflect important biological characteristics of the speaker, it also influences our social perceptions according to the ""what sounds beautiful is good"" phenomenon. Despite the widespread influence of vocal attractiveness on social interactions revealed by behavioral studies, its neural underpinnings are yet unknown. We measured brain activity while participants listened to a series of vocal sounds (""ah"") and performed an unrelated task. We found that voice-sensitive auditory and inferior frontal regions were strongly correlated with implicitly perceived vocal attractiveness. While the involvement of auditory areas reflected the processing of acoustic contributors to vocal attractiveness (""distance to mean"" and spectrotemporal regularity), activity in inferior prefrontal regions (traditionally involved in speech processes) reflected the overall perceived attractiveness of the voices despite their lack of linguistic content. These results suggest the strong influence of hidden nonlinguistic aspects of communication signals on cerebral activity and provide an objective measure of this influence.","[Bestelmeyer, Patricia E.

One fundamental motivation in social cognition is positivity motivation, that is, the desire to view close others in an overly positive light. Positivity motivation does not extend to non-close others. The current functional magnetic resonance imaging study is the first to identify neural regions modulated by positivity motivation. Participants compared the personalities of a close other (i.e., romantic partner) and a non-close other (i.e., roommate) with their average peer. Romantic partners were perceived as above average under certain conditions; roommates were perceived as similar to an average peer across conditions. Neural regions previously associated with social cognition did not significantly relate to positivity motivation. Instead, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and, to a lesser extent, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activation increased when social targets were perceived as similar to an average peer. Furthermore, OFC activity negatively correlated with the extent to which a social target was perceived as above average. Intimacy with the social target modulated the extent to which ventral ACC distinguished positive from negative stimuli. The results expand current knowledge about neural regions associated with social cognition and provide initial information needed to create neural models of social cognition.","[Hughes, Brent L.; Beer, Jennifer S.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Psychol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Hughes, Brent L.; Beer, Jennifer S.] Univ Texas Austin, Imaging Res Ctr, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Beer, JS (reprint author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Psychol, 1 Univ Stn A8000, Austin, TX 78712 USA.","beer@mail.utexas.edu","","","NSF BCS [0746017]","This work was supported by grant NSF BCS 0746017 (J.S.B).","","58","30","32","0","27","OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1047-3211","","","CEREB CORTEX","Cereb.

This study investigates age-related similarities and differences in the neural basis of affiliation and isolation. Participants viewed images of affiliation (groups engaged in social interaction) and isolation (lone individuals), as well as nonsocial stimuli (e.g., landscapes), while making pleasantness judgments and undergoing functional neuroimaging (BOLD fMRI). Results indicated age-related similarities in response to affiliation and isolation in recruitment of regions involved in theory of mind and self-referencing (e.g., temporal pole, medial prefrontal cortex). Yet age-related differences also emerged in response to affiliation and isolation in regions implicated in the theory of mind, as well as self-referencing. Specifically, in response to isolation versus affiliation images, older adults showed greater recruitment than did younger adults of the temporal pole, a region that is important for retrieval of personally relevant memories utilized to understand others' mental states. Furthermore, in response to images of affiliation versus isolation, older adults showed greater recruitment than did younger adults of the precuneus, a region implicated in self-referencing. We suggest that age-related divergence in neural activation patterns underlying judgments of scenes depicting isolation versus affiliation may indicate that older adults' theory of mind processes are driven by retrieval of isolation-relevant information. Moreover, older adults' greater recruitment of the precuneus for affiliation versus isolation suggests that the positivity bias for emotional information may extend to social information involving affiliation.","[Beadle, Janelle N.] Univ Iowa, Dept Psychiat, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Yoon, Carolyn] Univ Michigan, Stephen M Ross Sch Business, Dept Mkt, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Beadle, Janelle N.; Gutchess, Angela H.] Brandeis Univ, Dept Psychol, Neurosci Program, Waltham, MA 02254 USA","Beadle, JN (reprint author), Univ Iowa, Dept Psychiat, Roy J & Lucille A Carver Coll Med, 200 Hawkins Dr,W-278 GH, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.","janelle-beadle@uiowa.edu","","","National Institute on Aging [R21AG032382]; University of Michigan Ross School of Business [NS007292]","The authors gratefully acknowledge support from the National Institute on Aging (R21AG032382 to A.H.G.) and the University of Michigan Ross School of Business to C.Y.

We found that individuals' performance increased with increasing incentives; however, very high incentive levels led to the paradoxical consequence of worse performance. Between initial incentive presentation and task execution, striatal activity rapidly switched between activation and deactivation in response to increasing incentives. Critically, decrements in performance and striatal deactivations were directly predicted by an independent measure of behavioral loss aversion.

This fMRI study elucidated the impact of multimodal emotion processing and the specific contribution of each channel on behavioral empathy and its prerequisites. Ninety-six video clips displaying actors who told self-related stories were presented to 27 healthy participants. In two conditions, all channels uniformly transported only emotional or neutral information. Three conditions selectively presented two emotional channels and one neutral channel. Subjects indicated the actors' emotional valence and their own while fMRI was recorded. Activation patterns of tri-channel emotional communication reflected multimodal processing and facilitative effects for empathy. Accordingly, subjects' behavioral empathy rates significantly deteriorated once one source was neutral. However, emotionality expressed via two of three channels yielded activation in a network associated with theory-of-mind-processes. This suggested participants' effort to infer mental states of their counterparts and was accompanied by a decline of behavioral empathy, driven by the participants' emotional responses. Channel-specific emotional contributions were present in modality-specific areas. The identification of different network-nodes associated with human interactions constitutes a prerequisite for understanding dynamics that underlie multimodal integration and explain the observed decline in empathy rates.

To delineate the neural substrates of pragmatic comprehension, we conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with 20 normal adult volunteers. Participants read short stories followed by a target sentence. Depending on the context provided by the preceding stories, the target sentences were classified as follows: (1) metaphor versus literally coherent; (2) metaphor versus literally incoherent; (3) sarcasm versus literally coherent; and (4) sarcasm versus literally incoherent. For each task pair, we directly compared the activations evoked by the same target sentences in the different contexts. The contrast images were incorporated into a 2 (metaphor and sarcasm) x 2 (literal coherency and incoherency) design. Metaphor-specific activation was found in the head of the caudate, which might be involved in associating statements with potential meanings, and restricting sentence meanings within a set of possible candidates for what the speaker intended. Sarcasm-specific activation was found in the left amygdala, which is an important component of the neural substrates of social behavior. Conjunction analysis revealed that both metaphor and sarcasm activated the anterior rostral medial frontal cortex (arMFC), which is a key node of mentalizing. A distinct literal coherency effect was found in the orbital MFC, which is thought to be involved in monitoring. These mesial frontal areas are jointly involved in monitoring literal coherency and mentalizing within social contexts in order to comprehend the pragmatic meanings of utterances.

Previous functional neuroimaging studies investigating music processing have typically focused on either categorical differences between ""musicians versus nonmusicians"" or ""children versus adults."" In the present study, we explored a cross-sectional data set (n = 84) using multiple linear regression to isolate the performance-independent effects of age (5 to 33 years) and cumulative duration of musical training (0 to 21,000 practice hours) on fMRI activation similarities and differences between melodic discrimination (MD) and rhythmic discrimination (RD). Age-related effects common to MD and RD were present in three left hemisphere regions: temporofrontal junction, ventral premotor cortex, and the inferior part of the intraparietal sulcus, regions involved in active attending to auditory rhythms, sensorimotor integration, and working memory transformations of pitch and rhythmic patterns. By contrast, training-related effects common to MD and RD were localized to the posterior portion of the left superior temporal gyrus/planum temporale, an area implicated in spectrotemporal pattern matching and auditory-motor coordinate transformations. A single cluster in right superior temporal gyrus showed significantly greater activation during MD than RD. This is the first fMRI which has distinguished maturational from training effects during music processing. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

For example, effects of word frequency are exaggerated and effects of spelling-to-sound regularity are reduced in the lexical decision task, relative to reading aloud. Neuroimaging studies of reading often examine effects of task and stimulus properties on brain activity independently, but potential interactions between task demands and stimulus effects have not been extensively explored. To address this issue, we conducted lexical decision and symbol detection tasks using stimuli that varied parametrically in their word-likeness, and tested for task by stimulus class interactions. Interactions were found throughout the reading system, such that stimulus selectivity was observed during the lexical decision task, but not during the symbol detection task. Further, the pattern of stimulus selectivity was directly related to task difficulty, so that the strongest brain activity was observed to the most word-like stimuli that required ""no"" responses, whereas brain activity to words, which elicit rapid and accurate ""yes"" responses were relatively weak. This is in line with models that argue for task-dependent specialization of brain regions, and contrasts with the notion of task-independent stimulus selectivity in the reading system.

Stress also enhances amygdala responses towards emotional stimuli. Stress might thus be specifically detrimental to WM when one is distracted by emotional stimuli. Usually, emotional stimuli presented as distracters in a WM task slow down performance, while evoking more activation in ventral 'affective' brain areas, and a relative deactivation in dorsal 'executive' areas. We hypothesized that after acute social stress, this reciprocal dorsal-ventral pattern would be shifted towards greater increase of ventral 'affective' activation during emotional distraction, while impairing WM performance. To investigate this, 34 healthy men, randomly assigned to a social stress or control condition, performed a Sternberg WM task with emotional and neutral distracters inside an MRI scanner. Results showed that WM performance after stress tended to be slower during emotional distraction. Brain activations during emotional distraction was enhanced in ventral affective areas, while dorsal executive areas tended to show less deactivation after stress. These results suggest that acute stress shifts priority towards processing of emotionally significant stimuli, at the cost of WM performance.","[Oei, Nicole Y.

The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine whether induced stress resulted in gender-specific patterns of brain activation during a decision task involving monetary reward. Specifically, we manipulated physiological stress levels using a cold pressor task, prior to a risky decision making task. Healthy men (n = 24, 12 stressed) and women (n = 23, 11 stressed) completed the decision task after either cold pressor stress or a control task during the period of cortisol response to the cold pressor. Gender differences in behavior were present in stressed participants but not controls, such that stress led to greater reward collection and faster decision speed in males but less reward collection and slower decision speed in females. A gender-by-stress interaction was observed for the dorsal striatum and anterior insula. With cold stress, activation in these regions was increased in males but decreased in females.

We registered blood oxygen level-dependent activity of 23 participants during 2 imitative conditions: free (F) and instructed (I) episodes of imitating (i) and of being imitated (bi). In addition to the areas classically reported in instructed imitation tasks, 2 activation patterns were found, which differentiate the subconditions. Firstly, brain areas involved during decisional and attentional processes (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , dorsal part of anterior cingulate gyrus [dACC], pre-SMA) were activated during all conditions except for instructed imitation-classically used in neuroimaging studies of imitation. Second, a greater activation in dACC and insula combined with an increased deactivation in the default mode network was observed when subjects were imitated compared with when they imitated.

The use of such gestures involves the execution of a codified motor act by the addresser and its perception and decoding by the addressee. To examine underlying common and distinct neural correlates, we used fMRI tasks in which subjects viewed video clips of emblematic one-hand gestures. They were asked to (1) take the perspective of the addresser and imagine executing the gestures (expression condition), and to (2) take the perspective of the addressee and imagine being confronted with the gestures (reception condition). Common areas of activation were found in inferior frontal, medial frontal, and posterior temporal cortices with left-hemispheric predominance as well as in the cerebellum. The distinction between regions specifically involved in the expression or reception condition partly resembled the dorsal and ventral stream dichotomy of visual processing with junctions in inferior frontal and medial prefrontal cortices. Imagery of gesture expression involved the dorsal visual stream as well as higher-order motor areas. In contrast, gesture reception encompassed regions related to semantic processing, and medial prefrontal areas known to be involved in the process of understanding the intentions of others. In conclusion, our results provide evidence for a dissociation in representations of emblematic gesture processing between addresser and addressee in addition to shared components in language-related areas.

To date, neuroimaging evidence for similar coding of specific actions across the visual and motor modalities in human ventral premotor cortex (PMv)-the putative homologue of macaque F5-is limited to the case of actions observed from a first-person perspective. However, it is the third-person perspective that figures centrally in our understanding of the actions and intentions of others. To address this gap in the literature, we scanned participants with fMRI while they viewed two actions from either a first- or third-person perspective during some trials and executed the same actions during other trials. Using multivoxel pattern analysis, we found action-specific cross-modal visual-motor representations in PMv for the first-person but not for the third-person perspective. Additional analyses showed no evidence for spatial or attentional differences across the two perspective conditions. In contrast, more posterior areas in the parietal and occipitotemporal cortex did show cross-modal coding regardless of perspective. These findings point to a stronger role for these latter regions, relative to PMv, in supporting the understanding of others' actions with reference to one's own actions.","[Oosterhof, Nikolaas N.; Tipper, Steven P.; Downing, Paul E.] Bangor Univ, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales","Oosterhof, NN (reprint author), Bangor Univ, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales.","nikolaas.oosterhof@unitn.it","Tipper, Steven/I-6884-2012","Tipper, Steven/0000-0002-1554-0531; Downing, Paul/0000-0002-5046-2858; Tipper, Steven Paul/0000-0002-7066-1117","ESRC; Wales Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience; Boehringer Ingelheim; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F028652/1]","This research was supported by the ESRC (grant to S.

We found that sympathy activated regions associated with mentalising and moral conflict (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, precuneus and temporo-parietal junction). Sentencing also activated precuneus and anterior cingulate cortex, suggesting that mitigation is based on negative affective responses to murder, sympathy for mitigating circumstances and cognitive control to choose numerical punishments. Individual differences on the inclination to mitigate, the sentence reduction per unit of judged sympathy, correlated with activity in the right middle insula, an area known to represent interoception of visceral states.

To further address its role, we investigated the response of the amygdala to human and cat faces with varied pupil size, taking into account the effect of the gender and subjective attractiveness ratings. Twenty-seven subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while viewing faces with large and small pupils. Large pupil faces induced increased activation in the amygdala, without interactions with either subject or stimuli gender, although no equivalent activation differences were seen for cat face stimuli. The activation differences were irrespective of the perceived attractiveness, and without explicit knowledge about the manipulation of the pupil size. These data support the idea that the amygdala is responsive not only to explicit or implicit fear, abhorrence or preference, but also to other elements that might suggest heightened vigilance of biologically relevant stimuli, which does not necessarily require subjective awareness.","[Amemiya, Shiori; Ohtomo, Kuni] Univ Tokyo, Dept Radiol, Grad Sch Med, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138655, Japan","Amemiya, S (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Radiol, Grad Sch Med, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138655, Japan.","amemiya-tky@umin.ac.jp","","Amemiya, Shiori/0000-0002-2132-1642","","","","45","9","10","0","15","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

The game allowed us to examine the neural response to choosing a safe or risky option, anticipating outcome and receiving feedback. We found that alcohol increased risk-taking behavior, particularly among participants who experienced more stimulating effects of alcohol. fMRI scans demonstrated that alcohol increased activation in the striatum to risky compared with safe choices and dampened the neural response to notification of both winning and losing throughout the caudate, thalamus and insula.

This multi-domain aspect is reflected in the current models of translation. Recently, cognitive neurosciences have unraveled some brain mechanisms in the bilingualism domain, and it is quite logical to transfer such knowledge to the field of translation as well as the learning of translation. One interesting question is which non-linguistic cognitive and communicative processes are particularly involved in translation. Particularly, in translation, the author's intentions have to be interpreted although they may not be explicitly stated in the text. These intentions have to be considered while rendering the text for the target public, a process for which it is also important to anticipate the target public's prior knowledge of the subject and the extent to Which the author's aims and intentions have to be adapted in order to be correctly communicated in the other language. In neuroscience, being able to imagine another person's mental state is known as having a Theory of Mind (ToM). This skill seems dissociated from the group of executive functions - though it is very dependent on the latter and seems to rely on a large but individualized brain network. While translation is a widely investigated phenomenon at the micro-level, there is scarcely any research about the process of interpretation going on at the macro-level of text interpretation and rendering. Preliminary neuroscience experiments on the translations paradigm suggest that neurosciences can bring interesting data not only to linguistic but also to cognitive and social mechanisms of translation strategies.","[Annoni, Jean-Marie] Univ Fribourg & Geneva, Fribourg, Switzerland; [Lee-Jahnke, Hannelore; Sturm, Annegret] Univ Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland","Annoni, JM (reprint author), Univ Fribourg & Geneva, Fribourg, Switzerland.","jean-marie.annoni@unifr.ch; hannelore.lee-jahnke@unige.ch; annegret.sturm@unige.ch","","","","","","52","2","2","1","5","PRESSES UNIV MONTREAL","MONTREAL","PO BOX 6128, SUCCURSALE A, MONTREAL, QUEBEC H3C 3J7, CANADA","0026-0452","","","META","Meta","MAR","2012","57","1","","","","","96","107","","10.7202/1012743ar","","","","12","Language & Linguistics","Linguistics","V33TS","WOS:000209041700009","","Bronze","","","2019-02-21","searchterm","searchterm_records_4001-4500.txt"

To investigate the neural correlates of cooperation in real-time we conducted an fMRI hyperscanning study. We hypothesized that real-time cooperation to complete a maze task, using a blind-driving paradigm, would activate substrates implicated in theory of mind. We also hypothesized that cooperation would activate neural reward centers more than when participants completed the maze themselves. Of interest and in support of our hypothesis we found left caudate and putamen activation when participants worked together to complete the maze. This suggests that cooperation during task completion is inherently rewarding.

To investigate the neuronal substrates underlying intentional empathy, we scanned 20 healthy Chinese subjects, using fMRI, when they tried to feel inside the emotional states of neutral or angry faces of familiar (Asian) and unfamiliar (Caucasian) models. Skin color evaluation of the same stimuli served as a control task. Compared to a baseline condition, the empathy task revealed a network of established empathy regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral inferior frontal cortex and bilateral anterior insula. The contrast of intentional empathy vs skin color evaluation, however, revealed three regions: the bilateral inferior frontal cortex, whose hemodynamic responses were independent of perceived emotion and familiarity and the right-middle temporal gyrus, whose activity was modulated by emotion but not by familiarity. These findings extend our understanding of the role of the inferior frontal cortex and the middle temporal gyrus in empathy by demonstrating their involvement in intentional empathy.","[de Greck, Moritz; Wang, Gang; Han, Shihui] Peking Univ, Dept Psychol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xuedong; Wang, Xiaoying] Peking Univ, Hosp 1, Dept Radiol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Northoff, Georg] Univ Ottawa, Mental Hlth Res Inst, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada","de Greck, M (reprint author), Peking Univ, Dept Psychol, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.","moritz.greck@gmx.de; shan@pku.edu.cn","","de Greck, Moritz/0000-0002-4937-1262","Claus Tempelmann; Department of Neurology of the Otto-von-Guericke-University of Magdeburg; Science and Technology Fellowship Programme in China [STFP-25]; German research Foundation [DFG-SFB 779-A6]; Hope of Depression Research Foundation (HDRF); CRC; EJLB Michael Smith Foundation; National Natural Science Foundation of China [30630025, 30828012, 30910103901]; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) [2010CB833903]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","The authors thank Yan Fan, Zhenhao Shi and Yina Ma for their help in the preparation of the stimuli.

We hypothesized that incidental associations between self and objects would be manifested by activation in a brain region, medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), recruited in explicit self-referential processing. We further predicted that a memorial advantage for, and positivity-bias towards, self-relevant objects would be related to activity in MPFC. As anticipated, MPFC showed greater activation when objects were assigned to participants compared to when objects were assigned to another person. Activity in MPFC was also associated with superior subsequent source memory and increased preference for objects assigned to the self.

However, neuroimaging studies have yet to isolate and analyze the neural correlates of false (or phantom) recollection, focusing instead on general recognition processes. In doing so, results are mixed with respect to the role of the medial temporal lobes (MTL) in distinguishing between true and false retrieval. The present study sought to investigate the neural basis of true and phantom recollection and clarify the role of the MTL in dissociating between the two processes. Results showed that true and phantom recollection were associated with a largely overlapping retrieval network including activity in bilateral anterior parahippocampal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, and right superior parietal cortex. However, connectivity analyses using two common MTL seeds revealed a more inferior network (fusiform gyrus, hippocampus, middle temporal gyrus) associated with true recollection and a more superior network (superior parietal, superior frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex) associated with false recollection. Finally, direct comparisons between true and phantom recollection showed greater activity in right hippocampus and early visual cortex for true recollection, whereas no region exhibited greater activity for false recollection. Results indicate that while both true and phantom recollection show similar patterns of activation, there are also distinctions in the neural networks contributing to the two recollection processes. Moreover, results conclude that within the MTL, the hippocampus proper can distinguish between true and phantom recollection. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In the last 2 decades, a large number of brain imaging studies have explored the neural correlates of the perception of these signals. Formal synthesis is crucially needed, however, to extract the key circuits involved in human motion perception across the variety of paradigms and stimuli that have been used. Here, we used the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis approach with random effect analysis. We performed meta-analyses on three classes of biological motion: movement of the whole body, hands, and face. Additional analyses of studies of static faces or body stimuli and sub-analyses grouping experiments as a function of their control stimuli or task employed allowed us to identify main effects of movements and forms perception, as well as effects of task demand. In addition to specific features, all conditions showed convergence in occipito-temporal and fronto-parietal regions, but with different peak location and extent. The conjunction of the three ALE maps revealed convergence in all categories in a region of the right posterior superior temporal sulcus as well as in a bilateral region at the junction between middle temporal and lateral occipital gyri. Activation in these regions was not a function of attentional demand and was significant also when controlling for non-specific motion perception. This quantitative synthesis points towards a special role for posterior superior temporal sulcus for integrating human movement percept, and supports a specific representation for body parts in middle temporal, fusiform, precentral, and parietal areas.

The shared functional neuroanatomy of these processes has been demonstrated in a meta-analysis of independent task domains (Spreng, Mar & Kim, 2009) and within subjects performing both tasks (Rabin, Gilboa, Stuss, Mar, & Rosenbaum, 2010; Spreng & Grady, 2010). Here, we examine spontaneous low-frequency fluctuations in fMRI BOLD signal during rest from two separate regions key to memory and mentalizing, the left hippocampus and right temporal parietal junction, respectively. Activity in these two regions was then correlated with the entire brain in a resting-state functional connectivity analysis. Although the left hippocampus and right temporal parietal junction were not correlated with each other, both were correlated with a distributed network of brain regions. These regions were consistent with the previously observed overlap between autobiographical memory and mentalizing evoked brain activity found in past studies. Reliable patterns of overlap included the superior temporal sulcus, anterior temporal lobe, lateral inferior parietal cortex (angular gyrus), posterior cingulate cortex, dorsomedial and ventral prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyms, and the amygdala. We propose that the functional overlap facilitates the integration of personal and interpersonal information and provides a means for personal experiences to become social conceptual knowledge. This knowledge, in turn, informs strategic social behavior in support of personal goals. In closing, we argue for a new perspective within social cognitive neuroscience, emphasizing the importance of memory in social cognition. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Spreng, R.

Based on developmental and psychological research, it has been hypothesized that avoidant attachment style (AV) entails deactivating strategies in social contexts, whereas anxious attachment style (AX) involves hyper vigilance and up-regulation mechanisms. However, the neural substrates of differences in social emotion regulation associated with AAS have not been systematically investigated. Here we used fMRI in 19 healthy adults to investigate the effect of AAS on the processing of pleasant or unpleasant social and nonsocial scenes. Participants were asked either to naturally attend (NAT), cognitively reappraise (REAP), or behaviorally suppress (ESUP) their emotional responses. Avoidantly attached participants showed increased prefrontal and anterior cingulate activation to social negative scenes when making spontaneous emotion judgments. They also exhibited persistent increases in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left amygdala activity for the same stimuli during reappraisal, as well as additional activation in supplementary motor area and ventral caudate during the suppression of social positive emotions. These results suggest that AV may imply less efficient reappraisal strategies to regulate social negative emotions, and lead to higher conflict or effortful control when suppression cannot be employed. In contrast, anxiously attached participants showed differential increases in the right amygdala and left parahippocampal cortex for social negative and positive stimuli, respectively, but only when making spontaneous emotion judgments. No effect of AX was found during down-regulation conditions. This suggests heightened arousal to negative information without difficulty in down-regulating emotions through cognitive re-evaluation or suppression. Taken together, these findings reveal for the first time the neural underpinnings of attachment-related differences in social emotion regulation.","[Vrticka, Pascal; Sander, David; Vuilleumier, Patrik] Univ Geneva, Swiss Ctr Affect Sci, Geneva, Switzerland; [Vrticka, Pascal; Vuilleumier, Patrik] Univ Geneva, Lab Neurol & Imaging Cognit, Dept Neurol, Geneva, Switzerland; [Vrticka, Pascal; Vuilleumier, Patrik] Univ Geneva, Dept Neurosci, Univ Hosp, Geneva, Switzerland; [Vrticka, Pascal; Vuilleumier, Patrik] Univ Geneva, Sch Med, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Bondolfi, Guido] Univ Hosp Geneva, Dept Psychiat, Geneva, Switzerland; [Vrticka, Pascal; Sander, David] Univ Geneva, Lab Study Emot Elicitat & Express Lab E3, Dept Psychol, FPSE, Geneva, Switzerland","Vrticka, P (reprint author), Swiss Natl Ctr Affect Sci, 7 Rue Battoirs, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland.","pascal.vrticka@unige.ch","Vrticka, Pascal/H-2209-2013; Vrticka, Pascal/U-9166-2018","Vrticka, Pascal/0000-0002-4806-9037; Vrticka, Pascal/0000-0002-8920-5509","National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) Affective Sciences; Swiss National Science Foundation [51NF40-104897]","This research was supported by the National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) Affective Sciences financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation (no. 51NF40-104897) and hosted by the University of Geneva, plus grants of the Swiss National Science Foundation to D.

Consequently, the PD poses greater conflict between self-and collective interest, greater demands for computational reasoning to derive the optimal solution, and greater demands for mentalizing to infer the intentions of others. Consistent with these differences between the two games, the results indicate that the PD is associated with increased activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus, prefrontal cortex, parietal lobe, and temporoparietal junction. With less conflict, the demands for computation and mentalizing are reduced in the SH, and cooperation levels increase dramatically. The differences in brain activation elicited by the different incentive structures of the PD and the SH appear to be independent of individual differences in revealed social preferences.","[Emonds, Griet; Declerck, Carolyn H.; Boone, Christophe] Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Vandervliet, Everhard J.

Application to experimental results provides robust evidence for a single-system model in preference to multiple-systems models. This evidence comes from several sources including studies of the effects of amnesia and ageing on explicit and implicit memory. The framework allows a range of concepts in current memory research, such as familiarity, recollection, fluency, and source memory, to be linked to implicit memory.

While social exclusion poses a threat to all of these benefits, the psychological threat is particularly susceptible to modulation by the relation of the excluders to the excluded person. The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore the effects of manipulating the gender relation of participants to their excluders during an interactive ball-toss game. Ventral anterior cingulate cortex activation was higher during exclusion by same-gender peers, while right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex activation negatively correlated with self-reported distress in other-gender exclusion. Results imply that exclusion by one's own gender is fundamentally different from exclusion by the opposite gender, and suggest a regulatory role for ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in response to out-group exclusion. Individual differences in implicit gender attitudes modulated neural responses to exclusion.

IAT scores failed to predict how much money subjects awarded victims. However, in right inferior parietal lobule (BA 40) and in right superior/middle frontal gyrus (BA 9/10)-which have both previously been implicated in measuring biases and implicit preferences-the difference in neural activity between when subjects viewed Black faces paired with neutral adjectives and when subjects viewed White faces paired with neutral adjectives was positively correlated with the amount of money the subjects awarded victims.

However, most cultural neuroscience studies using the self-reference effect (SRE) paradigm have only used personality traits to explore cultural differences in the neural circuits of self-referential processes. In the present study, we used both personality traits and social identities as stimuli in the SRE paradigm and investigated whether and how one's cultural orientation (i.e., individualism vs. collectivism) affects the SRE in the brain. The results showed that the medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, bilateral temporoparietal regions, and precuneus were involved in self-representation for both personality traits and social identities. Importantly, cultural orientation predicted differential activation patterns in these regions. Collectivists showed stronger activation in the left temporoparietal regions than individualists, who mainly recruited the medial prefrontal regions. Our findings suggest that the personal and social self share common neural substrates, the activation of which can be modulated by one's cultural orientation.","[Sul, Sunhae] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Lab Social & Neural Syst Res, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Sul, Sunhae; Choi, Incheol] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Psychol, Seoul, South Korea; [Kang, Pyungwon] Korea Univ, Dept Brain & Cognit Engn, Seoul, South Korea","Sul, S (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Lab Social & Neural Syst Res, Blumlisalpstr 10, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.","sunhae.sul@gmail.com","","Sul, Sunhae/0000-0001-5286-4343","National Research Foundation of South Korea through South Korean government (MEST) [2010-0029271]","This work was supported by the Social Neuroscience Program of the National Research Foundation of South Korea funded through the South Korean government (MEST) (No. 2010-0029271).

In mate-choice literature, different characteristics of the value dimensions, including the sex difference in the value dimensions, and the involvement of self-assessment due to the mutual nature of the choice, have been suggested. We examined whether the brain-activation pattern during virtual mate choice would be congruent with these characteristics in terms of stimulus selectivity and activated brain regions. In measuring brain activity, young men and women were shown two pictures of either faces or behaviors, and they indicated which person they would choose either as a spouse or as a friend. Activation selective to spouse choice was observed face-selectively in men's amygdala and behavior-selectively in women's motor system. During both partner-choice conditions, behavior-selective activation was observed in the temporoparietal regions. Taking the available knowledge of these regions into account, these results are congruent with the suggested characteristics of value dimensions for physical attractiveness, parenting resources, and beneficial personality traits for a long-lasting relationship, respectively. The medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices were nonselectively activated during the partner choices, suggesting the involvement of a self-assessment process. The results thus provide neuroscientific support for the multi-component mate-choice mechanism.","[Sugiura, Motoaki] Tohoku Univ, Dept Funct Brain Imaging, Inst Dev Aging & Canc, Aoba Ku, Sendai, Miyagi 9808575, Japan; [Funayama, Risa; Sugiura, Motoaki] Miyagi Univ Educ, Fac Educ, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Wakusawa, Keisuke] Takuto Rehabil Ctr Children, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Horie, Kaoru; Sato, Shigeru] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Intercultural Studies, Sendai, Miyagi 9808575, Japan; [Horie, Kaoru; Sato, Shigeru] Tohoku Univ, LBC Res Ctr, Sendai, Miyagi 9808575, Japan; [Horie, Kaoru] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Languages & Cultures, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Sato, Shigeru] Juntendo Univ, Sch Med, Tokyo 113, Japan","Sugiura, M (reprint author), Tohoku Univ, Dept Funct Brain Imaging, Inst Dev Aging & Canc, Aoba Ku, Seiryo Machi 4-1, Sendai, Miyagi 9808575, Japan.","motoaki@idac.tohoku.ac.jp","","Jeong, Hyeonjeong/0000-0002-5094-5390","MEXT [21119504]; 21st Century Center of Excellence (COE) Program (MEXT), ""A Strategic Research and Education Center for an Integrated Approach to Language and Cognition"" (Tohoku University)","This study was supported by KAKENHI (21119504) from MEXT, and the 21st Century Center of Excellence (COE) Program (MEXT), ""A Strategic Research and Education Center for an Integrated Approach to Language and Cognition"" (Tohoku University).","","48","4","4","0","31","PSYCHOLOGY PRESS","HOVE","27 CHURCH RD, HOVE BN3 2FA, EAST SUSSEX, ENGLAND","1747-0919","","","SOC NEUROSCI-UK","Soc.

The prefrontal cortices are particularly vulnerable to age-related decline, and numerous studies implicate the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) in successful IGT performance. However, the relationship between IGT performance and VMPFC function in older adults has not yet been tested by fMRI. In the present study, older adults with seemingly no cognitive impairments performed the IGT and a non-gambling control task during fMRI. Group analyses indicate that in these older adults, regardless of IGT performance level, a right VMPFC subregion is activated during the IGT, while successful IGT performance is correlated with left VMPFC activation, suggesting that bilateral VMPFC during risky, nontransparent situations may contribute to successful decision-making in older adults. Individual subject analyses reveal substantial variation regarding the extent and location of VMPFC activation during the IGT, a finding not captured in the group analysis: There is no correlation between IGT performance and extent of activation in the right VMPFC, although there is such a correlation between left VMPFC activation and IGT performance.","[Rogalsky, Corianne; Vidal, Christine; Li, Xiangrui; Damasio, Hanna] Univ So Calif, Dana & David Dornsife Cognit Neurosci Imaging Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","Rogalsky, C (reprint author), Univ So Calif, Dana & David Dornsife Cognit Neurosci Imaging Ctr, 3520A McClintock Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.","rogalsky@college.usc.edu","","","National Institute on Aging [5-P50-AG00512-24]","We would like to thank Malaak Moussa (subject recruitment and data collection), Prof. Jonas Kaplan (data analysis), Prof. Mara Mather (comments), and Prof. Antoine Bechara (support and comments) for their help in the performance of the study and for their helpful comments.

We recently presented findings indicating that identity-dependent representations are encoded using a prototype-referenced scheme, in a manner notably similar to that proposed for facial identity. Could it be that identity-independent representations are encoded this way too? We investigated this by adapting participant to anti-expressions and asking them to categorize the expression aftereffect in a prototype probe that was either the same (congruent) or different (incongruent) identity to that of the adapter. To distinguish between encoding schemes, we measured how aftereffect magnitude changed in response to variations in the strength of adapters. The increase in aftereffect magnitude with adapter strength characteristic of prototype-referenced encoding was observed in both congruent and, crucially, incongruent conditions. We conclude that identity-independent representations of expression are indeed encoded using a prototype-referenced scheme. The striking similarity between the encoding of facial identity and both representations of expression raises the possibility that prototype-referenced encoding might be a common scheme for encoding the many types of information in faces needed to enable our complex social interactions.","[Skinner, Andrew L.; Benton, Christopher P.] Univ Bristol, Sch Expt Psychol, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England","Skinner, AL (reprint author), Univ Bristol, Sch Expt Psychol, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England.","andy.skinner@bristol.ac.uk","","Benton, Christopher/0000-0003-1873-5964","Economic and Social Research Council [RES-000-22-4319]","This work was supported in part by Economic and Social Research Council Grant RES-000-22-4319 awarded to Chris Benton.","","38","9","9","0","3","ASSOC RESEARCH VISION OPHTHALMOLOGY INC","ROCKVILLE","12300 TWINBROOK PARKWAY, ROCKVILLE, MD 20852-1606 USA","1534-7362","","","J VISION","J.

In this study, we sought to identify a ""core"" network for calculation and hence to determine the extent to which left hemisphere language areas are part of this network. We examined performance on addition and subtraction problems in two modalities: one using conventional two-digit problems that can be easily encoded into language; the other using novel shape representations. With regard to numerical problems, our results revealed increased left fronto-temporal activity in addition, and increased parietal activity in subtraction, potentially reflecting retrieval of linguistically encoded information during addition. The shape problems elicited activations of occipital, parietal and dorsal temporal regions, reflecting visual reasoning processes. A core activation common to both calculation types involved the superior parietal lobule bilaterally, right temporal sub-gyral area, and left lateralized activations in inferior parietal (BA 40), frontal (BA 6/8/32) and occipital (BA 18) regions. The large bilateral parietal activation could be attributed to visuo-spatial processing in calculation. The inferior parietal region, and particularly the left angular gyrus, was part of the core calculation network. However, given its activation in both shape and number tasks, its role is unlikely to reflect linguistic processing per se. A possibility is that it serves to integrate right hemisphere visuo-spatial and left hemisphere linguistic and executive processing in calculation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

By using fMRI, we explored whether reflexive shifts of attention triggered by different distracters were influenced by the motor effector used for performing an overt response. In separate blocks, healthy participants performed a directional saccadic or a hand pointing movement. Color changes of a central black fixation point constituted the imperative instruction signal to make a leftward (red color) or a rightward (blue color) movement while ignoring distracting leftward or rightward oriented gaze, hand pointing, or arrow. Distracters that were directionally incongruent with the instruction cue impaired the saccadic and pointing-release RTs. The comparison of incongruent vs. congruent conditions showed an increase of BOLD signal in the frontal eye field (FEF), the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) bilaterally. Importantly, a specific relationship between distracter and effector used for the response was found in these frontal and parietal regions. In particular, higher activity in the FEF, for distracting gaze was found mainly during the saccadic response task. In the same vein, higher activity in the left and right IPS regions was found for the distracting hand mainly in the hand pointing task.

Because reappraisal is thought to be supported by linearly developing prefrontal regions, one prediction is that reappraisal ability develops linearly. However, recent investigations into socio-emotional development suggest that there are non-linear patterns that uniquely affect adolescents. We compared older children (10-13), adolescents (14-17) and young adults (18-22) on a task that distinguishes negative emotional reactivity from reappraisal ability. Behaviorally, we observed no age differences in self-reported emotional reactivity, but linear and quadratic relationships between reappraisal ability and age. Neurally, we observed linear age-related increases in activation in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, previously identified in adult reappraisal. We observed a quadratic pattern of activation with age in regions associated with social cognitive processes like mental state attribution (medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, anterior temporal cortex). In these regions, we observed relatively lower reactivity-related activation in adolescents, but higher reappraisal-related activation. This suggests that (i) engagement of the cognitive control components of reappraisal increases linearly with age and (ii) adolescents may not normally recruit regions associated with mental state attribution, but (iii) this can be reversed with reappraisal instructions.","[McRae, Kateri] Univ Denver, Dept Psychol, Denver, CO 80209 USA; [Gross, James J.; Robertson, Elaine R.] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Weber, Jochen; Ochsner, Kevin N.] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychol, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Sokol-Hessner, Peter] CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Ray, Rebecca D.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Radiol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Ray, Rebecca D.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychiat, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Gabrieli, John D.

We use behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to study the way in which subjects playing in a sequential game of perfect information learn the optimal backward induction strategy for the game. Experimental data from our two studies support two main findings: First, subjects converge to a common process of recursive inference similar to the backward induction procedure for solving the game. The process is recursive because earlier insights and conclusions are used as inputs in later steps of the inference. This process is matched by a similar pattern in brain activation, which also proceeds backward, following the prediction error: brain activity initially codes the responses to losses in final positions; in later trials this activity shifts to the starting position. Second, the learning process is not exclusively cognitive, but instead combines experience-based learning and abstract reasoning. Critical experiences leading to the adoption of an improved solution strategy appear to be stimulated by brain activity in the reward system. This indicates that the negative affect induced by initial failures facilitates the switch to a different method of solving the problem. Abstract reasoning is combined with this response, and is expressed by activation in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Differences in brain activation match differences in performance between subjects who show different learning speeds.","[Hawes, Daniel R.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Vostroknutov, Alexander] Maastricht Univ, Dept Econ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Rustichini, Aldo] Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA","Rustichini, A (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, 1925 4th St South,4-101 Hanson Hall, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.","aldo.rustichini@gmail.com","","Vostroknutov, Alexander/0000-0001-6588-7448","NSF [SES 0924896]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G005230/1]","We thank audience at several seminars and conferences.

Young and older adults are better at identifying positive than negative facial expressions and also expressions of young than older faces. Little, however, is known about the neural processes associated with reading different emotions, particularly in faces of different ages, in samples of young and older adults. During fMRI, young and older participants identified expressions in happy, neutral, and angry young and older faces. The results suggest a functional dissociation of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) in reading facial emotions that is largely comparable in young and older adults: Both age groups showed greater vmPFC activity to happy compared to angry or neutral faces, which was positively correlated with expression identification for happy compared to angry faces. In contrast, both age groups showed greater activity in dmPFC to neutral or angry than happy faces which was negatively correlated with expression identification for neutral compared to happy faces. A similar region of dmPFC showed greater activity for older than young faces, but no brain-behavior correlations. Greater vmPFC activity in the present study may reflect greater affective processing involved in reading happy compared to neutral or angry faces. Greater dmPFC activity may reflect more cognitive control involved in decoding and/or regulating negative emotions associated with neutral or angry than happy, and older than young, faces.","[Ebner, Natalie C.] Univ Florida, Dept Psychol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Johnson, Marcia K.] Yale Univ, Dept Psychol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Fischer, Hakan] Stockholm Univ, Dept Psychol, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Fischer, Hakan] Karolinska Inst, Aging Res Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden","Ebner, NC (reprint author), Univ Florida, Dept Psychol, POB 112250, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.","natalie.ebner@ufl.edu","","Ebner, Natalie/0000-0002-2705-7520","NIA NIH HHS [R37 AG009253, P30 AG028740]","","","108","40","40","2","20","FRONTIERS RESEARCH FOUNDATION","LAUSANNE","PO BOX 110, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND","1664-1078","","","FRONT PSYCHOL","Front.

However, this overlap raises the question of whether it may reflect a unique distributed population of bimodal neurons or, alternatively, the activity of intermingled but independent populations. We used fMRI on 28 female volunteers and used multivariate pattern analysis techniques to probe for more fine-grain spatial representations of seen and felt pain. Using a whole-brain approach, we found that only in the anterior insula (bilaterally) the distribution of cortical activity evoked by seeing another person's hand in pain was spatially similar to that of pain felt on one's own hand. Subsequent region of interest analyses also implicated the middle insula (right hemisphere) and the middle cingulate cortex. Furthermore, for the anterior insula, the spatial distribution of activity associated with one's pain also replicates that of the perception of negative but painless stimuli. Our data show how the neural representations of aversive events affecting oneself are also recruited when the same events affect others, and provide the stronger evidence thus far of a unique distributed cortical ensemble coding for aversive events regardless of the subject who is affected.","[Corradi-Dell'Acqua, Corrado; Hofstetter, Christoph; Vuilleumier, Patrik] Univ Geneva, Swiss Ctr Affect Sci, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland; [Corradi-Dell'Acqua, Corrado; Hofstetter, Christoph; Vuilleumier, Patrik] Ctr Med Univ Geneva, Lab Neurol & Imaging Cognit, Dept Neurosci, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Corradi-Dell'Acqua, Corrado; Hofstetter, Christoph; Vuilleumier, Patrik] Ctr Med Univ Geneva, Neurol Clin, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland","Corradi-Dell'Acqua, C (reprint author), Univ Geneva, Swiss Ctr Affect Sci, 7 Rue Battoirs, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland.","corrado.corradi@unige.ch","","","National Center of Competence in Research for the Affective Sciences; Swiss National Science Foundation [51NF40-104897]; Geneva Academic Society","This work was supported by the National Center of Competence in Research for the Affective Sciences financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation (Grant 51NF40-104897) and hosted by the University of Geneva, and a grant from the Geneva Academic Society to P.V.

However, actions considered odd or unusual were found to trigger additional activity in the so-called theory of mind (ToM) network, pointing to deliberations on the actor's mental states. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, the hypothesis was tested that an allocentric perspective on a normal action, and even more so the sight of the actor's face, suffices to evoke ToM activity. Subjects observed short videos of object manipulation filmed from either the egocentric or the allocentric perspective, the latter including the actor's face in half of the trials. On the basis of a regions of interest analysis using ToM coordinates, we found increased neural activity in several regions of the ToM network. First, perceiving actions from an allocentric compared with the egocentric perspective enhanced activity in the left temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Second, the presence of the actor's face enhanced activation in the TPJ bilaterally, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Finally, the mPFC and PCC showed increased responses when the actor changed with respect to the preceding trial. These findings were further corroborated by zmap findings for the latter two contrasts. Together, findings indicate that observation of normal everyday actions can engage ToM areas and that an allocentric perspective, seeing the actor's face and seeing a face switch, are effective triggers.

Even fewer have investigated socially relevant, dynamic displays of real actors telling jokes. Instead, many studies have focused on responses to static cartoons or written jokes in isolation. In the present investigation, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine brain activation in response to video clips of comedians performing stand-up comedy, a more socially relevant task than reading jokes or cartoons in isolation. Participants watched video clips of eight stand-up comedians, half female/half male, that were prerated by a separate group of participants from the same population as eliciting either high or low levels of amusement, thereby allowing us to control for comedian attributes and comedic style. We found that high-funny clips elicited more activation in several brain regions involved with reward responses, including the nucleus accumbens, caudate, and putamen. A regression with participants' own ratings of humor revealed similar activity in reward areas as well as in regions involved in theory of mind. These findings indicate that dynamic social displays of humor do engage reward responses. The rewarding nature of humor may help explain why it is so valued socially.","[Franklin, Robert G., Jr.; Adams, Reginald B., Jr.] Penn State Univ, Dept Psychol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Adams, RB (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Psychol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.","radams@psu.edu","","","Social Science Research Institute, Penn State University","This research was supported by a Social Science Research Institute grant, Penn State University, to R.

However, little is known about the brain mechanisms that underlie the comprehension of indirect speech. In this study, we conducted a functional MRI experiment using a scenario reading task to compare the neural activity induced by an indirect reply (a type of indirect speech) and a literal sentence. Participants read a short scenario consisting of three sentences. The first two sentences explained the situation of the protagonists, whereas the third sentence had an indirect, literal, or unconnected meaning. The indirect reply condition primarily activated the bilateral fronto-temporal networks (Brodmann's Areas (BA) 47 and 21) and the dorso-medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). In the literal sentence condition, only the left fronto-temporal network (BA 45 and 21) and the dmPFC (posterior region) were activated. In addition, we found greater activation resulting from comprehension of an indirect reply than from literal sentence comprehension in the dmPFC, the left middle frontal area (BA 9), the bilateral inferior frontal area (BA 9/47), and the right middle temporal area (BA 21).

Despite extensive reports of regional functional specialization underlying action perception, action execution and imitation, our understanding of the potential contribution of subcortical sites is limited, as is our knowledge of how regions displaying functional specialization interact with each other on a system level. While in the scanner, participants performed a simple imitation paradigm with three conditions: Observe trials, in which participants passively viewed a human actor executing a sequence of four finger presses on a keypad; Imitate trials, in which participants imitated the actor's finger presses on a keyboard; and Execute trials, in which participants also executed finger presses but did so based on visuospatial cues in the absence of the actor's hand. Relative to the Execute condition, Imitate trials evoked significantly more activity in superior and inferior parietal lobules (SPL, IPL), posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), and in a ventral aspect of dorsal premotor cortex (PMd). Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis, a means of assessing effective connectivity, revealed significant interactions with regions of cerebellar lobule VII from seeds both in the right pSTS and right SPL, such that activity in these sites was more highly correlated during imitation. A similar interaction was found between right pSTS and left IPL These results clarify the role of cortical regions supporting action observation, action execution and imitation, and highlight the role the cerebellum may play in facilitating both motor and nonmotor aspects of imitation.

In both cases, her eyes and face might be turned rightward, but the information conveyed is markedly different, depending on the object of her gaze. Numerous studies have examined brain systems underlying the perception of gaze direction, but less is known about the neural basis of perceiving gaze shifts to specific objects. During fMRI, participants observed an actor look toward one of two objects, each occupying a distinct location. Video stimuli were sequenced to obtain repetition suppression (RS) for object identity, independent of spatial location. In a control condition, a spotlight highlighted one of the objects, but no actor was present. Observation of the human actor's gaze compared with the spotlight engaged frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices, consistent with a broad action observation network. RS for gazed object in the human condition was found in posterior intraparietal sulcus (pIPS). RS for highlighted object in the spotlight condition was found in middle occipital, inferior temporal, medial fusiform gyri, and superior parietal lobule. These results suggest that human pIPS is specifically sensitive to the type object that an observed actor looks at (tool vs. food), irrespective of the observed actor's gaze location (left vs. right). A general attention or lower-level object feature processing mechanism cannot account for the findings because a very different response pattern was seen in the spotlight control condition. Our results suggest that, in addition to spatial orienting, human pIPS has an important role in object-centered social orienting.","[Ramsey, Richard; Hamilton, Antonia F. de C.] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Cross, Emily S.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Nijmegen, Netherlands","Ramsey, R (reprint author), Catholic Univ Louvain, Fac Psychol & Sci Educ, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.","richard.ramsey@uclouvain.be","Hamilton, Antonia/B-3612-2008; Cross, Emily/B-4565-2009","Hamilton, Antonia/0000-0001-8000-0219; Cross, Emily/0000-0002-1671-5698; Ramsey, Richard/0000-0002-0329-2112","Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F001649/1]","","","74","10","10","0","6","MIT PRESS","CAMBRIDGE","55 HAYWARD STREET, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA","0898-929X","","","J COGNITIVE NEUROSCI","J.

Assessing already during the negotiation in which direction one's counterpart tends would provide a tremendous advantage. Recently, neuroimaging techniques combined with multivariate pattern classification of the acquired data have made it possible to discriminate subjective states of mind on the basis of their neuronal activation signature. However, to enable an online-assessment of the participant's mind state both approaches need to be extended to a real-time technique. By combining real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and online pattern classification techniques, we show that it is possible to predict human behavior during social interaction before the interacting partner communicates a specific decision. Average accuracy reached approximately 70% when we predicted online the decisions of volunteers playing the ultimatum game, a well-known paradigm in economic game theory. Our results demonstrate the successful online analysis of complex emotional and cognitive states using real-time fMRI, which will enable a major breakthrough for social fMRI by providing information about mental states of partners already during the mutual interaction. Interestingly, an additional whole brain classification across subjects confirmed the online results: anterior insula, ventral striatum, and lateral orbitofrontal cortex, known to act in emotional self-regulation and reward processing for adjustment of behavior, appeared to be strong determinants of later overt behavior in the ultimatum game. Using whole brain classification we were also able to discriminate between brain processes related to subjective emotional and motivational states and brain processes related to the evaluation of objective financial incentives.","[Hollmann, Maurice; Baecke, Sebastian; Luetzkendorf, Ralf; Mueller, Charles; Adolf, Daniela; Bernarding, Johannes] Univ Magdeburg, Inst Biometry & Med Comp Sci, Fac Med, D-39106 Magdeburg, Germany; [Rieger, Jochem W.] Univ Magdeburg, Dept Neurol, Fac Med, D-39106 Magdeburg, Germany; [Hollmann, Maurice] Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Dept Neurol, Leipzig, Germany","Hollmann, M (reprint author), Univ Magdeburg, Inst Biometry & Med Comp Sci, Fac Med, D-39106 Magdeburg, Germany.","mhollmann@cbs.mpg.de","","Rieger, Jochem/0000-0003-0955-2306","","","","62","19","20","2","29","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","SAN FRANCISCO","185 BERRY ST, STE 1300, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94107 USA","1932-6203","","","PLOS ONE","PLoS One","OCT 7","2011","6","10","","","","","","","e25304","10.1371/journal.pone.0025304","","","","12","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science & Technology - Other Topics","834OC","WOS:000295970300009","22003388","DOAJ Gold, Green Published","","","2019-02-21","searchterm","searchterm_records_4501-5000.txt"

We previously reported that crude threat cues (backward masked fearful faces) facilitate spatial attention through a network of brain regions consisting of the amygdala, anterior cingulate and contralateral visual cortex. However, results from previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) dot-probe studies have been inconclusive regarding a fearful face-elicited contralateral modulation of visual targets. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the capture of spatial attention by crude threat cues would facilitate processing of subsequently presented visual stimuli within the masked fearful face-elicited 'spotlight of attention' in the contralateral visual cortex. Participants performed a backward masked fearful face dot-probe task while brain activity was measured with fMRI. Masked fearful face left visual field trials enhanced activity for spatially congruent targets in the right superior occipital gyrus, fusiform gyrus and lateral occipital complex, while masked fearful face right visual field trials enhanced activity in the left middle occipital gyrus. These data indicate that crude threat elicited spatial attention enhances the processing of subsequent visual stimuli in contralateral occipital cortex, which may occur by lowering neural activation thresholds in this retinotopic location.","[Carlson, Joshua M.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Biomed Engn, Sch Med, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Carlson, Joshua M.; Reinke, Karen S.; Habib, Reza] Mem Hosp Carbondale, Carbondale, IL USA; [Carlson, Joshua M.; LaMontagne, Pamela J.; Habib, Reza] So Illinois Univ, Dept Psychol, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Reinke, Karen S.] Univ Illinois, Dept Psychol, Springfield, IL USA","Carlson, JM (reprint author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Biomed Engn, Sch Med, Bioengn Bldg Room 117, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.","carlsonjm79@gmail.com","","","","","","33","25","25","2","16","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

The functional basis of face evaluation. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U. S. A., 105, 11087-11092, 2008]. Independent of the task, the response within regions of the occipital, fusiform, and lateral prefrontal cortices was sensitive to the valence dimension, with larger responses to low-valence faces. Additionally, there were extensive quadratic responses in the fusiform gyri and dorsal amygdala, with larger responses to faces at the extremes of the face valence continuum than faces in the middle. In all these regions, participants 'avoidance decisions correlated with brain responses, with faces more likely to be avoided evoking stronger responses.

The projection of vagina, uterine cervix, and nipple to the sensory cortex in humans has not been reported. Aims. The aim of this study was to map the sensory cortical fields of the clitoris, vagina, cervix, and nipple, toward an elucidation of the neural systems underlying sexual response. Methods. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we mapped sensory cortical responses to clitoral, vaginal, cervical, and nipple self-stimulation. For points of reference on the homunculus, we also mapped responses to the thumb and great toe (hallux) stimulation. Main Outcome Measures. The main outcome measures used for this study were the fMRI of brain regions activated by the various sensory stimuli. Results. Clitoral, vaginal, and cervical self-stimulation activated differentiable sensory cortical regions, all clustered in the medial cortex (medial paracentral lobule). Nipple self-stimulation activated the genital sensory cortex (as well as the thoracic) region of the homuncular map. Conclusion. The genital sensory cortex, identified in the classical Penfield homunculus based on electrical stimulation of the brain only in men, was confirmed for the first time in the literature by the present study in women applying clitoral, vaginal, and cervical self-stimulation, and observing their regional brain responses using fMRI. Vaginal, clitoral, and cervical regions of activation were differentiable, consistent with innervation by different afferent nerves and different behavioral correlates. Activation of the genital sensory cortex by nipple self-stimulation was unexpected, but suggests a neurological basis for women's reports of its erotogenic quality.

It tries to establish the validity of stochastic DCMs that accommodate random fluctuations in hidden neuronal and physiological states. We compare and contrast deterministic and stochastic DCMs, which do and do not ignore random fluctuations or noise on hidden states. We then compare stochastic DCMs, which do and do not ignore conditional dependence between hidden states and model parameters (generalised filtering and dynamic expectation maximisation, respectively). We first characterise state-noise by comparing the log evidence of models with different a priori assumptions about its amplitude, form and smoothness. Face validity of the inversion scheme is then established using data simulated with and without state-noise to ensure that DCM can identify the parameters and model that generated the data. Finally, we address construct validity using real data from an fMRI study of internet addiction. Our analyses suggest the following. (i) The inversion of stochastic causal models is feasible, given typical fMRI data. (ii) State-noise has nontrivial amplitude and smoothness. (iii) Stochastic DCM has face validity, in the sense that Bayesian model comparison can distinguish between data that have been generated with high and low levels of physiological noise and model inversion provides veridical estimates of effective connectivity. (iv) Relaxing conditional independence assumptions can have greater construct validity, in terms of revealing group differences not disclosed by variational schemes. Finally, we note that the ability to model endogenous or random fluctuations on hidden neuronal (and physiological) states provides a new and possibly more plausible perspective on how regionally specific signals in fMRI are generated.

Right frontal regions were also recruited - a pattern not usually seen in full-image SL processing. This activation may reflect the recruitment of information about person identity from the reduced display. A direct comparison of identify-signer and identify-sign conditions showed these tasks relied to a different extent on the posterior inferior regions. Signer identification elicited greater activation than sign identification in (bilateral) inferior temporal gyri (BA 37/19), fusiform gyri (BA 37), middle and posterior portions of the middle temporal gyri (BAs 37 and 19), and superior temporal gyri (BA 22 and 42). Right inferior frontal cortex was a further focus of differential activation (signer > sign). These findings suggest that the neural systems supporting point-light displays for the processing of SL rely on a cortical network including areas of the inferior temporal cortex specialized for face and body identification. While this might be predicted from other studies of whole body point-light actions (Vaina, Solomon, Chowdhury, Sinha, & Belliveau, 2001) it is not predicted from the perspective of spoken language processing, where voice characteristics and speech content recruit distinct cortical regions (Stevens, 2004) in addition to a common network. In this respect, our findings contrast with studies of voice/speech recognition (Von Kriegstein, Kleinschmidt, Sterzer, & Giraud, 2005).

We examine whether alcohol's social stress dampening effect may be via reduced activity in the cortical systems that subserve awareness of bodily sensations, and are associated with affective distress. Methods: Blood oxygen level-dependent activation was measured through 24 functional magnetic resonance imaging sessions in 12 healthy volunteers during an emotional face-processing task following ingestion of a moderate dose of alcohol and a placebo beverage. Results: Results revealed that bilateral anterior insula response to emotional faces was significantly attenuated following consumption of alcohol, when compared with placebo (clusters > 1472 mu l; corrected P < 0.05).

One explanation for this influence involves implicit priming of trait associations. To study this effect, we activated implicit associations in participants of 'being Clever' or 'being Stupid' that were task relevant, and studied its behavioural impact on an independent cognitive task (the n-back task). Activating a representation of 'Clever' caused participants to slow their reaction times after errors on the working memory task, while the reverse pattern was seen for associations to 'Stupid'. Critically, these behavioural effects were absent in control conditions. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we show that the neural basis of this effect involves the anterior paracingulate cortex (area 32) where activity tracked the observed behavioural pattern, increasing its activity during error monitoring in the 'Clever' condition and decreasing in the 'Stupid' condition. The data provide a quantitative demonstration of how implicit cues, which specifically target a person's self-concept, influences the way we react to our own behaviour and point to the anterior paracingulate cortex as a critical cortical locus for mediating these self-concept related behavioural regulations.","[Bengtsson, Sara L.; Dolan, Raymond J.; Passingham, Richard E.] UCL, Wellcome Trust Ctr Neuroimaging, London WC1N 3BG, England; [Passingham, Richard E.] Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, Oxford OX1 3UD, England","Bengtsson, SL (reprint author), UCL, Wellcome Trust Ctr Neuroimaging, 12 Queen Sq, London WC1N 3BG, England.","sbengtss@gmail.com","","Bengtsson, Sara/0000-0003-4567-102X; Dolan, Ray/0000-0001-9356-761X","Swedish Research Council (VR); Wellcome Trust","This work was supported by a personal grant for S.

The present study evaluated whether emotional faces engage sustained neural processing by examining the attenuation of neural repetition suppression to repeated emotional faces. Repetition suppression of neural function refers to the general reduction of neural activity when processing a repeated stimulus. Preferential processing of emotional face stimuli, however, should elicit sustained neural processing such that repetition suppression to repeated emotional faces is attenuated relative to faces with no emotional content. We measured the reduction of functional magnetic resonance imaging signals associated with immediate repetition of neutral, angry and happy faces. Whereas neutral faces elicited the greatest suppression in ventral visual cortex, followed by angry faces, repetition suppression was the most attenuated for happy faces. Indeed, happy faces showed almost no repetition suppression in part of the right-inferior occipital and fusiform gyri, which play an important role in face-identity processing. Our findings suggest that happy faces are associated with sustained visual encoding of face identity and thereby assist in the formation of more elaborate representations of the faces, congruent with findings in the behavioral literature.","[Suzuki, Atsunobu] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Goh, Joshua O.

Eighteen normal volunteers underwent imaging while they viewed the faces of two unfamiliar individuals: one individual's face was partially accompanied by negative emotion but the other's was not. After the volunteers learned the relationship between the faces and the emotion, they formed a more negative impression of the person's face when the emotion was presented. Subtraction analysis of the individuals' neutral faces revealed activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and superior temporal sulcus, but this activity did not correlate with the change of impression from face. On the other hand, the response in the left amygdala negatively correlated with the change of impression from face in the first run. Time modulation analysis revealed that activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex associated with negative emotion was the largest in the initial part of the acquisition. These results suggest that a negative impression from face may be formed by orchestrated activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala, and that the activity has a prominent role in the initial acquisition of negative emotion.","[Iidaka, Tetsuya] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Showa Ku, Aichi 4668550, Japan; [Sadato, Norihiro] Natl Inst Physiol Sci, Div Cerebral Integrat, Okazaki, Aichi 444, Japan","Iidaka, T (reprint author), Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Showa Ku, 65 Tsurumai, Aichi 4668550, Japan.","iidaka@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp","Iidaka, Tetsuya/M-8847-2014","Iidaka, Tetsuya/0000-0002-6199-8711","Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture","This study was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas, 'Face perception and recognition' and a Grant-in-Aid for Academic Frontier Project for Private Universities by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture.

Twenty-five participants were scanned as they completed a task in which they made costly decisions to contribute money to their family and noncostly decisions to accept personal monetary rewards. Decisions to contribute to the family recruited brain regions involved in self-control and mentalizing, especially for individuals with stronger family obligation preferences. Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses revealed that individuals with stronger family obligation preferences showed greater functional coupling between regions involved in self-control and mentalizing with the ventral striatum, a region involved in reward processing.

Here, we investigated how smiling and angry face stimuli interacted with financial reward feedback in a stochastically rewarded decision-making task. Subjects reliably preferred the smiling faces despite equivalent reward feedback, demonstrating a socially driven bias. We fit a Bayesian reinforcement learning model to factor the effects of financial rewards and emotion preferences in individual subjects, and regressed model predictions on the trial-by-trial fMRI signal. Activity in the subcallosal cingulate and the ventral striatum, both involved in reward learning, correlated with financial reward feedback, whereas the differential contribution of social value activated dorsal temporo-parietal junction and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, previously proposed as components of a mentalizing network. We conclude that the impact of social stimuli on value-based decision processes is mediated by effects in brain regions partially separable from classical reward circuitry.","[Averbeck, Bruno B.] NIMH, Neuropsychol Lab, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Evans, Simon; Fleming, Stephen M.; Dolan, Raymond J.; Averbeck, Bruno B.] UCL Inst Neurol, London, England","Averbeck, BB (reprint author), NIMH, Neuropsychol Lab, NIH, Bldg 49,Room 1B80,49 Convent Dr,MSC 4415, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.","bruno.averbeck@nih.gov","","Dolan, Ray/0000-0001-9356-761X","Wellcome Trust; MRC within UCL; NIH, National Institute of Mental Health","We thank all the volunteers who participated in this study.

This mimicry can be subtly modulated by different social contexts. We recently found behavioral evidence that direct eye gaze rapidly and specifically enhances mimicry of intransitive hand movements (Wang et al., 2011). Based on past findings linking medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to both eye contact and the control of mimicry, we hypothesized that mPFC might be the neural origin of this behavioral effect. The present study aimed to test this hypothesis. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning, 20 human participants performed a simple mimicry or no-mimicry task, as previously described (Wang et al., 2011), with direct gaze present on half of the trials. As predicted, fMRI results showed that performing the task activated mirror systems, while direct gaze and inhibition of the natural tendency to mimic both engaged mPFC. Critically, we found an interaction between mimicry and eye contact in mPFC, superior temporal sulcus (STS) and inferior frontal gyrus. We then used dynamic causal modeling to contrast 12 possible models of information processing in this network. Results supported a model in which eye contact controls mimicry by modulating the connection strength from mPFC to STS. This suggests that mPFC is the originator of the gaze-mimicry interaction and that it modulates sensory input to the mirror system. Thus, our results demonstrate how different components of the social brain work together to on-line control mimicry according to the social context.","[Wang, Yin; Ramsey, Richard; Hamilton, Antonia F. de C.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Psychol, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England","Wang, Y (reprint author), Univ Nottingham, Sch Psychol, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.","mirrorneuronwang@gmail.com","Hamilton, Antonia/B-3612-2008","Hamilton, Antonia/0000-0001-8000-0219; Ramsey, Richard/0000-0002-0329-2112","Overseas Research Students Award; University of Nottingham; Economic and Social Research Council [RES-061-25-0138]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F001649/1]","Y.W. is supported by Overseas Research Students Award and University of Nottingham Scholarship.

Converging evidence suggests that adolescent females are particularly sensitive to social rejection. We used a novel fMRI adaptation of the Cyberball social rejection paradigm to investigate the neural response to social rejection in 19 mid-adolescent (aged 14-16) and 16 adult female participants. Across all participants, social exclusion (relative to inclusion) elicited a response in bilateral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) extending into ventral and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and medial orbitofrontal cortex; and the left ventrolateral PFC (vIPFC); regions that have been associated in previous studies with social evaluation, negative affective processing, and affect regulation respectively. However, the exclusion-related response in right vIPFC, a region associated in previous studies with the regulation of rejection-related distress, was attenuated in adolescents. Within mPFC, greater activation during exclusion vs. inclusion was associated with greater self-reported susceptibility to peer influence in adolescents but not in adults. This suggests that the brain's response to experimentally-induced social rejection relates to adolescent behaviour in real-world social interactions. We speculate about the potential implications of these findings for educational settings. In particular, functional development of affective circuitry during adolescence may influence social interaction within the school peer group. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Attentional mechanisms act not only to select relevant stimuli but also to exclude irrelevant stimuli. There is evidence that we can actively ignore irrelevant information. We measured neural activity relating to successfully ignoring distracters (using preview search) and found increases in both the precuneus and primary visual cortex during preparation to ignore distracters. We also found reductions in activity in fronto-parietal regions while previewing distracters and a reduction in activity in early visual cortex during search when a subset of items was successfully excluded from search, both associated with precuneus activity. These results are consistent with the proposal that actively excluding distractions has two components: an initial stage where distracters are encoded, and a subsequent stage where further processing of these items is inhibited.

While there is considerable evidence to suggest that unexpected targets such as female airline pilots and male nurses impact the inferential and memorial aspects of person construal, it has yet to be established if early perceptual operations are similarly sensitive to the stereotype-related status of individuals. To explore this issue, the current investigation measured neural activity while participants made social (i.e., sex categorization) and non-social (i.e., dot detection) judgments about men and women portrayed in expected and unexpected occupations. When participants categorized the stimuli according to sex, stereotype-inconsistent targets elicited increased activity in cortical areas associated with person perception and conflict resolution. Comparable effects did not emerge during a non-social judgment task. These findings begin to elucidate how and when stereotypic beliefs modulate the formation of person percepts in the brain.

Here we examined the effect of cultural variation in preference for social hierarchy on the neural basis of intergroup empathy. Using cross-cultural neuroimaging, we measured neural responses while Korean and American participants observed scenes of racial ingroup and outgroup members in emotional pain. Compared to Caucasian-American participants, Korean participants reported experiencing greater empathy and elicited stronger activity in the left temporo-parietal junction (L-TPJ), a region previously associated with mental state inference, for ingroup compared to outgroup members. Furthermore, preferential reactivity within this region to the pain of ingroup relative to outgroup members was associated with greater preference for social hierarchy and ingroup biases in empathy. Together, these results suggest that cultural variation in preference for social hierarchy leads to cultural variation in ingroup-preferences in empathy, due to increased engagement of brain regions associated with representing and inferring the mental states of others.

Interestingly, however, individuals differ substantially in their level of expressiveness, ranging from high expressive to stoic individuals. Here, we investigate which brain mechanisms underlie the regulation of facial expressiveness to acute pain. Facial responses, pain ratings, and brain activity (BOLD-fMRI) evoked by noxious heat and warm (control) stimuli were recorded in 34 human volunteers with different degrees of facial expressiveness. Within-subject and between-subject variations in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses were examined specifically in relation to facial responses. Pain expression was inversely related to frontostriatal activity, consistent with a role in downregulating facial displays. More detailed analyses of the peak activity in medial prefrontal cortex revealed negative BOLD responses to thermal stimuli, an effect generally associated with the default mode network. Given that this negative BOLD response was weaker in low expressive individuals during pain, it could reflect stronger engagement in, or reduced disengagement from, self-reflective processes in stoic individuals. The occurrence of facial expressions during pain was coupled with stronger primary motor activity in the face area and-interestingly-in areas involved in pain processing. In conclusion, these results indicate that spontaneous pain expression reflects activity within nociceptive pathways while stoicism involves the active suppression of expression, a manifestation of learned display rules governing emotional communication and possibly related to an increased self-reflective or introspective focus.","[Kunz, Miriam; Lautenbacher, Stefan] Otto Friedrich Univ Bamberg, D-96045 Bamberg, Germany; [Kunz, Miriam; Chen, Jen-I; Vachon-Presseau, Etienne; Rainville, Pierre] Univ Montreal, Dept Stomatol, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada; [Kunz, Miriam; Chen, Jen-I; Vachon-Presseau, Etienne; Rainville, Pierre] Univ Montreal, Ctr Rech, Inst Univ Geriatrie Montreal, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada","Kunz, M (reprint author), Otto Friedrich Univ Bamberg, Markuz Pl 3, D-96045 Bamberg, Germany.","miriam.kunz@uni-bamberg.de","Kunz, Miriam/P-8160-2016; Rainville, Pierre/M-5480-2015","Kunz, Miriam/0000-0002-0740-6738; Rainville, Pierre/0000-0001-9801-757X; , Stefan/0000-0002-2829-347X","Alexander von Humboldt Stiftung; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Ku2294/2]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","This study was supported by a German TRANSCOOP grant from the Alexander von Humboldt Stiftung (S.

A central hypothesis, with some empirical support, is that face-selective regions in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) are particularly responsive to dynamic information in faces, whereas the fusiform face area (FFA) computes the static or invariant properties of faces. Here we directly tested this hypothesis by measuring the magnitude of response in each region to both dynamic and static stimuli. Consistent with the hypothesis, we found that the response to movies of faces was not significantly different from the response to static images of faces from these same movies in the right FFA and right occipital face area (OFA). By contrast the face-selective region in the right posterior STS (pSTS) responded nearly three times as strongly to dynamic faces as to static faces, and a face-selective region in the right anterior STS (aSTS) responded to dynamic faces only. Both of these regions also responded more strongly to moving faces than to moving bodies, indicating that they are preferentially engaged in processing dynamic information from faces, not in more general processing of any dynamic social stimuli. The response to dynamic and static faces was not significantly different in a third face-selective region in the posterior continuation of the STS (pcSTS). The strong selectivity of face-selective regions in the pSTS and aSTS, but not the FFA, OFA or pcSTS, for dynamic face information demonstrates a clear functional dissociation between different face-selective regions, and provides further clues into their function.

Greater activation in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were also found in the same contrast after small volume correction (SVC).

We describe a scheme that recovers the (dynamic) Bayesian dependency graph (connections in a network) using observed network activity. This network discovery uses Bayesian model selection to identify the sparsity structure (absence of edges or connections) in a graph that best explains observed time-series. The implicit adjacency matrix specifies the form of the network (e.g., cyclic or acyclic) and its graph-theoretical attributes (e.g., degree distribution). The scheme is illustrated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series to discover functional brain networks. Crucially, it can be applied to experimentally evoked responses (activation studies) or endogenous activity in task-free (resting state) fMRI studies. Unlike conventional approaches to network discovery, DCM permits the analysis of directed and cyclic graphs. Furthermore, it eschews (implausible) Markovian assumptions about the serial independence of random fluctuations. The scheme furnishes a network description of distributed activity in the brain that is optimal in the sense of having the greatest conditional probability, relative to other networks. The networks are characterised in terms of their connectivity or adjacency matrices and conditional distributions over the directed (and reciprocal) effective connectivity between connected nodes or regions. We envisage that this approach will provide a useful complement to current analyses of functional connectivity for both activation and resting-state studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Musical actions are over-experienced by musicians and not by non-musicians, and thus offer a unique way to examine how action expertise affects brain processes when the predictability of the produced sound is manipulated. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan 11 drummers and 11 age- and gender-matched novices who made judgments on point-light drumming movements presented with sound. In Experiment 1, sound was synchronized or desynchronized with drumming strikes, while in Experiment 2 sound was always synchronized, but the natural covariation between sound intensity and velocity of the drumming strike was maintained or eliminated. Prior to MRI scanning, each participant completed psychophysical testing to identify personal levels of synchronous and asynchronous timing to be used in the two fMRI activation tasks. In both experiments, the drummers' brain activation was reduced in motor and action representation brain regions when sound marched the observed movements, and was similar to that of novices when sound was mismatched. This reduction in neural activity occurred bilaterally in the cerebellum and left parahippocampal gyros in Experiment I. and in the right inferior parietal lobule, inferior temporal gyros, middle frontal gyros and precentral gyrus in Experiment 2. Our results indicate that brain functions in action-sound representation areas are modulated by multimodal action expertise. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Four components were extracted, and all showed statistically significant sensitivity to the memory load manipulation. Additionally, two of the four components sustained this peak activity, both for approximately 3 s (Components 1 and 4). The functional networks that showed sustained activity were characterized by increased activations in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and left supramarginal gyrus, and decreased activations in the primary auditory cortex and ""default network"" regions. The functional networks that did not show sustained activity were instead dominated by increased activation in occipital cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, sensori-motor cortical regions, and superior parietal cortex. The response shapes suggest that although all four components appear to be invoked at encoding, the two sustained-peak components are likely to be additionally involved in the delay period.

This approach faces two important challenges. First, a small number of examples are typically represented by a much larger number of features, making it hard to select the few informative features that allow for accurate predictions. Second, accuracy estimates and information maps often remain descriptive and can be hard to interpret. In this paper, we propose a model-based decoding approach that addresses both challenges from a new angle. Our method involves (i) inverting a dynamic causal model of neurophysiological data in a trial-by-trial fashion; (ii) training and testing a discriminative classifier on a strongly reduced feature space derived from trial-wise estimates of the model parameters; and (iii) reconstructing the separating hyperplane. Since the approach is model-based, it provides a principled dimensionality reduction of the feature space; in addition, if the model is neurobiologically plausible, decoding results may offer a mechanistically meaningful interpretation. The proposed method can be used in conjunction with a variety of modelling approaches and brain data, and supports decoding of either trial or subject labels. Moreover, it can supplement evidence-based approaches for model-based decoding and enable structural model selection in cases where Bayesian model selection cannot be applied. Here, we illustrate its application using dynamic causal modelling (DCM) of electrophysiological recordings in rodents. We demonstrate that the approach achieves significant above-chance performance and, at the same time, allows for a neurobiological interpretation of the results. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

We observed increased activation in the insula, supplementary motor area, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PEG), and temporal parietal junction when participants were behaving consistent with our model, and found increased activity in the ventromedial PFC, dorsomedial PEG, and nucleus accumbens when they chose to abuse trust and maximize their financial reward.

To extend this work, we examined the neural correlates associated with attributing negative social treatment to racial discrimination to explore the cognitive and affective processes that occur as discrimination is being experienced. To do this, we scanned Black participants while they were ostensibly excluded by Whites and then measured distress levels and race-based attributions for exclusion. In response to being socially excluded by Whites, Black participants who appeared to be more distressed showed greater social pain-related neural activity and reduced emotion regulatory neural activity. In addition, those who attributed exclusion to racial discrimination displayed less social pain-related and more emotion regulatory neural activity. The potential negative impact that frequent negative social treatment and discrimination-related distress regulation might have on individuals' long-term mental and physical health is discussed.","[Masten, Carrie L.; Telzer, Eva H.; Eisenberger, Naomi I.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA","Eisenberger, NI (reprint author), 1285 Franz Hall,Box 951563, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.","neisenbe@ucla.edu","","","UCLA Export Center on Research, Education, Training and Strategic Communication on Minority Health Disparities [5 P60 MD000508-04]; National Science Foundation; Elizabeth Munsterberg Koppitz Fellowship; Ruth L.

We find that this landscape is sparsely populated: despite previous calls for debate, there are few articles that discuss both fMRI and ethical, legal, or social implications (ELSI), and even fewer direct citations between the two literatures.

Here we demonstrate that when rejection is powerfully elicited-by having people who recently experienced an unwanted break-up view a photograph of their ex-partner as they think about being rejected-areas that support the sensory components of physical pain (secondary somatosensory cortex; dorsal posterior insula) become active. We demonstrate the overlap between social rejection and physical pain in these areas by comparing both conditions in the same individuals using functional MRI. We further demonstrate the specificity of the secondary somatosensory cortex and dorsal posterior insula activity to physical pain by comparing activated locations in our study with a database of over 500 published studies. Activation in these regions was highly diagnostic of physical pain, with positive predictive values up to 88%. These results give new meaning to the idea that rejection ""hurts.""

While the lifespan trajectory of emotional processing and its regulation has been characterized behaviorally, few studies have investigated the underlying neural mechanisms. Here, older adults (range: 59-73 years) and younger adults (range: 19-33 years) participated in a cognitive reappraisal task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. On each trial, participants viewed positive, negative or neutral pictures and either naturally experienced the image ('Experience' condition) or attempted to detach themselves from the image ('Reappraise' condition). Across both age groups, cognitive reappraisal activated prefrontal regions similar to those reported in prior studies of emotion regulation, while emotional experience activated the bilateral amygdala. Psychophysiological interaction analyses revealed that the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and amygdala demonstrated greater inverse connectivity during the 'Reappraise' condition relative to the 'Experience' condition. The only regions exhibiting significant age differences were the left IFG and the left superior temporal gyrus, for which greater regulation-related activation was observed in younger adults. Controlling for age, increased performance on measures of cognition predicted greater regulation-related decreases in amygdala activation. Thus, while older and younger adults use similar brain structures for emotion regulation and experience, the functional efficacy of those structures depends on underlying cognitive ability.","[Winecoff, Amy; LaBar, Kevin S.; Madden, David J.; Cabeza, Roberto; Huettel, Scott A.] Duke Univ, Ctr Cognit Neurosci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [LaBar, Kevin S.; Cabeza, Roberto; Huettel, Scott A.] Duke Univ, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [LaBar, Kevin S.; Madden, David J.] Duke Univ, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Madden, David J.; Huettel, Scott A.] Duke Univ, Brain Imaging & Anal Ctr, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Huettel, SA (reprint author), Duke Univ, Ctr Cognit Neurosci, Box 90999, Durham, NC 27708 USA.","scott.huettel@duke.edu","","","National Institute of Aging [R21-3077]","The authors thank Mauricio Delgado for suggestions about our emotion regulation paradigm, Susanne Harris for assistance with data collection, Max Cohen and Jasmeet Pannu Hayes for assistance with data analysis, and McKell Carter, John Clithero and David Smith for manuscript comments.

However, despite the importance of these ER strategies, previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have not sufficiently disentangled the specific neural impact of REAP versus ESUP on brain responses to different kinds of emotion-eliciting events. Moreover, although different effects have been reported for stimulus valence (positive vs. negative), no study has systematically investigated how ER may change emotional processing as a function of particular stimulus content variables (i.e., social vs. nonsocial). Our fMRI study directly compared brain activation to visual scenes during the use of different ER strategies, relative to a ""natural"" viewing condition, but also examined the effects of ER as a function of the social versus nonsocial content of scenes, in addition to their negative versus positive valence (by manipulating these factors orthogonally in a 2 x 2 factorial design). Our data revealed that several prefrontal cortical areas were differentially recruited during either REAP or ESUP, independent of the valence and content of images. In addition, selective modulations by either REAP or ESUP were found depending on the negative valence of scenes (medial fusiform gyrus, anterior insula, dmPFC), and on their nonsocial (middle insula) or social (bilateral amygdala, mPFC, posterior cingulate) significance. Furthermore, we observed a significant lateralization in the amygdala for the effect of the two different ER strategies, with a predominant modulz.tion by REAP on the left side but by ESUP on the right side. Taken together, these results do not only highlight the distributed nature of neural changes induced by ER, but also reveal the specific impact of different strategies (REAP or ESUP), and the specific sites implicated by different dimensions of emotional information (social or negative).

In order to infer that effects observed with the specific items (a particular set of pictures or stories) are generalizable to the entire population (all faces, or all stories about beliefs), it is necessary to perform an ""item analysis."" Item analyses may also reveal relationships between secondary (non-hypothesized) features of the items and functional activity. Here, we perform an item analysis on a set of stories commonly used for localizing brain regions putatively involved in Theory of Mind (ToM): right and left temporo-parietal junction (RTPJ/LTPJ), precuneus (PC), superior temporal sulcus (STS) and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). We address the following questions: Do brain regions that comprise the ToM network respond reliably across items (i.e. different stories about beliefs)? Do these brain regions demonstrate reliable preferences for items within the category? Can we predict any region's response to individual items, by using other features of the stimuli? We find that the TOM network responds reliably to stories about beliefs, generalizing across items as well as subjects. In addition, several regions in the ToM network have reliable preferences for individual items. Linguistic features of the stimuli did not predict these item preferences. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Compound words were read out loud as primes that were morphologically related to picture names (e.g. the word jaszak, 'coat pocket' was used for a picture of a coat; Dutch jas), or primes were form-related, but not morphologically related monomorphemic words (e.g. jasmijn, 'jasmine'). The morphologically related compounds could be semantically transparent (e.g. eksternest, 'magpie nest') or opaque (e.g. eksteroog, lit. 'magpie eye,' corn,' for a picture of a magpie, Dutch ekster). These four priming conditions were complemented by two matched, unrelated conditions. The production of morphologically related, complex words but not the production of form-related words facilitated subsequent picture naming. Also, morphologically related but not form-related words led to a neural priming effect in the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG). The effects did not differ for transparent and opaque relations. The results point to a functional role of LIFG in morphological information processing during language production contrary to previous meta-analytic findings. Specifically, morphological priming effects in language production seem to be independent from semantic overlap. However, further research should confirm the independence of morphological and phonological factors. It is suggested that LIFG subserves word form encoding in language production.

A complex bilateral network, involving frontal, parietal and occipital areas, appears to be associated with self-face recognition, with a particularly high implication of the right hemisphere. Results indicate that it remains difficult to determine which specific cognitive operation is reflected by each recruited brain area, in part due to the variability of used control stimuli and experimental tasks. A synthesis of the interpretations provided by previous studies is presented. The relevance of using self-recognition as an indicator of self-awareness is discussed. We argue that a major aim of future research in the field should be to identify more clearly the cognitive operations induced by the perception of the self-face, and search for dissociations between neural correlates and cognitive components.

At first glance, this seems to transform the self from an ephemeral theoretical entity to something concrete and measurable. However, the transformation is by no means unproblematic. We trace the development of two important experimental paradigms in the study of the self, self-face recognition and the adjective self ascription task. We show how the experimental instrumentalization has gone hand in hand with a simplification of the self-concept, and how more conceptual and theoretical reflections on the structure, function and nature of self have either disappeared altogether or receded into the background.

Here, we examined neural activity during empathy for social exclusion and assessed how empathy-related neural processes might relate to subsequent prosocial behavior toward the excluded victim. During an fMRI scan, participants observed one person being excluded by two others, and afterwards sent emails to each of these 'people.' Later, a group of raters assessed how prosocial (e.g., helpful, comforting) the emails were. Observing exclusion (vs. inclusion) activated regions associated with mentalizing (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus), and highly empathic individuals activated both mentalizing regions and social pain-related regions (anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex). Additionally, the empathy-related activity in the anterior insula and medial prefrontal cortex was associated with later prosocial behavior toward the victim, and exploratory mediation analyses indicated that medial prefrontal cortex activity, in particular, may support the link between trait empathy and prosocial behavior. Overall, findings suggest that empathy-related neural responses to social experiences may promote spontaneous prosocial treatment of those in need. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The current studies examine the effect of perceivers' sexist attitudes on associations of agency with, and neural responses to, images of sexualized and clothed men and women. In Study 1, male (but not female) participants with higher hostile sexism scores more quickly associated sexualized women with first-person action verbs (""handle"") and clothed women with third-person action verbs (""handles"") than the inverse, as compared to their less sexist peers. In Study 2, hostile sexism correlated negatively with activation of regions associated with mental state attribution-medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate, temporal poles-but onlywhen viewing sexualized women. Heterosexual men best recognized images of sexualized female bodies (but not faces), as compared with other targets' bodies; however, neither face nor body recognition was related to hostile sexism, suggesting that the fMRI findings are not explained by more or less attention to sexualized female targets. Diminished mental state attribution is not unique to targets that people prefer to avoid, as in dehumanization of stigmatized people. The current studies demonstrate that appetitive social targets may elicit a similar response depending on perceivers' attitudes toward them.","[Cikara, Mina] Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Eberhardt, Jennifer L.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Cikara, M (reprint author), Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.","mcikara@princeton.edu","","","Princeton University; University Center for Human Values","We thank the Russell Sage Foundation and Princeton Neuroscience Institute for their generous support of this research project.

Subjectively negative outcomes (failure of the favored team or success of the rival team) activated anterior cingulate cortex and insula, whereas positive outcomes (success of the favored team or failure of the rival team, even against a third team) activated ventral striatum.

The role of specific brain areas for these processes is a matter of debate. In this event-related fMRI study, we varied the information processing mode of participants exposed to aversive and neutral pictures. Based on four different tasks, participants' attentional focus onto the emotional quality of the stimuli and the own emotional involvement was increased systematically across tasks. Regardless of task, stronger activation to threatening vs. neutral pictures was found in several regions such as the amygdala, anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex, primary somatosensory cortex and medial prefrontal cortex. However, there was a parametric increase of activation with increasing attention to one's own emotion specifically in the right posterior insula and right primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, i.e. in areas implicated in self-awareness of a person's own body.

The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) has been suggested in detecting response conflict during various conflict tasks. Recent findings, however, have indicated not only that two distinct subregions of dACC are involved in conflict processing but also that the conflict occurs at both perceptual and response levels. In this study, we sought to examine whether perceptual and response conflicts are functionally dissociated in dACC. Thirteen healthy subjects performed a version of the Stroop task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. We identified a functional dissociation of the caudal dACC (cdACC) and the rostral dACC (rdACC) in their responses to different sources of conflict. The cdACC was selectively engaged in perceptual conflict whereas the rdACC was more active in response conflict. Further, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was coactivated not with cdACC but with rdACC. We suggest that cdACC plays an important role in regulative processing of perceptual conflict whereas rdACC is involved in detecting response conflict. Hum Brain Mapp 32: 304-312, 2011.

In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we employed a unique modification of an interactive virtual ball-tossing game called ""Cyberball"" (Williams et al.. 2000) and a novel paradigm called ""Cybershape,"" in which rules are broken in the absence of social exclusion, to dissociate brain regions that process social exclusion from rule violations more generally. Our Cyberball game employed an alternating block design and removed evoked responses to events when the participant was throwing the ball in inclusion to make this condition comparable to exclusion, where participants did not throw. With these modifications, we replicated prior findings of ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), insula, and posterior cingulate cortex activity evoked by social exclusion relative to inclusion. We also identified exclusion-evoked activity in the hippocampi, left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and left middle temporal gyrus. Comparing social exclusion and rule violation revealed a functional dissociation in the active neural systems as well as differential functional connectivity with vACC. Some overlap was observed in regions differentially modulated by social exclusion and rule violation, including the vACC and lateral parietal cortex. These overlapping brain regions showed different activation during social exclusion compared to rule violation, each relative to fair play. Comparing activation patterns to social exclusion and rule violation allowed for the dissociation of brain regions involved in the experience of exclusion versus expectancy violation.

However, the expectations we generate on the basis of people's emotions can mismatch their actual behaviour in certain circumstances, which generates conflict. In the present study, we explored the neural mechanisms of emotional conflict during interpersonal interactions. Participants had to accept or reject economic offers made by several partners who displayed emotional expressions. On every trial, a cue informed participants of whether they could trust the emotion of their partner or not. Trustworthy (low-conflict) partners with happy facial expressions were cooperative and those with angry expressions did not cooperate. Untrustworthy (high-conflict) partners, on the other hand, cooperated when their expression was angry and did not cooperate when they displayed a happy emotion. Behavioural responses were faster for trustworthy than for untrustworty partners. High-conflict partners activated the anterior cingulate and the anterior insula. In turn, trustworthy partners were associated with activations in the left precuneus. Our results suggest that the emotion displayed by another person affects our decision-making in social contexts. When emotional expressions are linked to their natural consequences, they engage ToM processes. In contrast, untrustworthy emotional expressions engage conflict-related brain regions.

Humans process and evaluate these two dimensions very quickly due to their great adaptive importance. Trustworthiness evaluation is crucial for modulating behavior toward strangers; attractiveness evaluation is a crucial factor for mate selection, possibly providing cues for reproductive success. As both dimensions rapidly guide social behavior, this study tests the hypothesis that both judgments may be subserved by overlapping brain networks. To this end, we conducted an activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis on 16 functional magnetic resonance imaging studies pertaining to facial judgments of trustworthiness and attractiveness. Throughout combined, individual, and conjunction analyses on those two facial judgments, we observed consistent maxima in the amygdala which corroborates our initial hypothesis. This finding supports the contemporary paradigm shift extending the amygdala's role from dominantly processing negative emotional stimuli to processing socially relevant ones. We speculate that the amygdala filters sensory information with evolutionarily conserved relevance. Our data suggest that such a role includes not only ""fight-or-flight"" decisions but also social behaviors with longer term pay-off schedules, e.g., trustworthiness and attractiveness evaluation.","[Bzdok, D.; Langner, R.; Caspers, S.; Zilles, K.; Eickhoff, Simon B.] Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH, Inst Neurosci & Med INM 2, Res Ctr Julich, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Bzdok, D.; Langner, R.; Habel, U.; Eickhoff, Simon B.] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Aachen, Germany; [Bzdok, D.; Habel, U.; Eickhoff, Simon B.] Int Res Training Grp Schizophrenia & Autism IRTG, Aachen, Germany; [Bzdok, D.; Langner, R.; Caspers, S.; Habel, U.; Zilles, K.; Eickhoff, Simon B.] Julich Aachen Res Alliance JARA Translat Brain Me, Aachen, Germany; [Kurth, F.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Semel Inst Neurosci & Human Behav, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Zilles, K.] Univ Dusseldorf, C&O Vogt Inst Brain Res, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Laird, A.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr San Antonio, Res Imaging Inst, San Antonio, TX 78229 USA","Eickhoff, SB (reprint author), Forschungszentrum Julich GmbH, Inst Neurosci & Med INM 2, Res Ctr Julich, D-52425 Julich, Germany.","S.Eickhoff@fz-juelich.de","Caspers, Svenja/H-9346-2013; Laird, Angela/B-5800-2010; Zilles, Karl/J-9704-2013; Eickhoff, Simon/K-2061-2013","Caspers, Svenja/0000-0001-5083-4669; Laird, Angela/0000-0003-3379-8744; Zilles, Karl/0000-0001-9296-9959; Eickhoff, Simon/0000-0001-6363-2759; Langner, Robert/0000-0002-3237-001X; Zilles, Karl/0000-0002-4705-4175; Habel, Ute/0000-0003-0703-7722","German Research Council (DFG) [IRTG 1328]; Human Brain Project [R01-MH074457-01A1]; Helmholtz Initiative on Systems-Biology ""The Human Brain Model""","This study was supported by the German Research Council (DFG, IRTG 1328, KZ, SBE, DB), the Human Brain Project (R01-MH074457-01A1), and the Helmholtz Initiative on Systems-Biology ""The Human Brain Model"" (KZ, SBE).","","132","71","73","3","66","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","1863-2653","1863-2661","","BRAIN STRUCT FUNCT","Brain Struct.

It is unknown, however, whether amygdala responses to first impressions can be validated by objective criteria. Here, we examined amygdala responses to faces of Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) where real-world outcomes could be measured objectively by the amounts of profits made by each CEO's company. During fMRI scanning, participants made incidental judgments about the symmetry of each CEO's face. After scanning, participants rated each CEO's face on leadership ability. Parametric analyses showed that greater left amygdala response to the CEOs' faces was associated with higher post-scan ratings of the CEOs' leadership ability. In addition, greater left amygdala response was also associated with greater profits made by the CEOs' companies and this relationship was statistically mediated by external raters' perceptions of arousal. Thus, amygdala response reflected both subjective judgments and objective measures of leadership ability based on first impressions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Results showed that amygdala activation for faces over a scrambled image baseline increased with age. Children, but not adults, showed greater amygdala activation to happy than angry faces; in addition, amygdala activation for angry faces increased with age. In keeping with growing evidence of a positivity bias in young children, our data suggest that children find happy faces to be more salient or meaningful than angry faces. Both children and adults showed preferential activation to mothers' over strangers' faces in a region of rostral anterior cingulate cortex associated with self-evaluation, suggesting that some nodes in frontal evaluative networks are active early in development.

We used multivariate analyses of event-related fMRI data to identify whole-brain patterns, or networks of activity. Participants demonstrated better recognition for scenes vs faces and for negative vs neutral and positive items. Activity was increased in extrastriate cortex and inferior frontal gyri for emotional scenes, relative to neutral scenes and all face types. Increased activity in these regions also was seen for negative faces relative to positive faces. Correct recognition of negative faces and scenes (hits vs correct rejections) was associated with increased activity in amygdala, hippocampus, extrastriate, frontal and parietal cortices. Activity specific to correctly recognized emotional faces, but not scenes, was found in sensorimotor areas and rostral prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that emotional valence and type of visual stimulus both modulate brain activity at recognition, and influence multiple networks mediating visual, memory and emotion processing.

Sixteen participants completed the Highly Sensitive Person questionnaire, a standard measure of SPS. Subsequently, they were tested on a change detection task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). SPS was associated with significantly greater activation in brain areas involved in high-order visual processing (i.e. right claustrum, left occipitotemporal, bilateral temporal and medial and posterior parietal regions) as well as in the right cerebellum, when detecting minor (vs major) changes in stimuli. These findings remained strong and significant after controlling for neuroticism and introversion, traits that are often correlated with SPS. These results provide the first evidence of neural differences associated with SPS, the first direct support for the sensory aspect of this trait that has been studied primarily for its social and affective implications, and preliminary evidence for heightened sensory processing in individuals high in SPS.","[Jagiellowicz, Jadzia; Xu, Xiaomeng; Aron, Arthur; Aron, Elaine] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Psychol, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Cao, Guikang; Feng, Tingyong] Southwest Univ, Sch Psychol, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China; [Weng, Xuchu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Psychol, Lab Higher Brain Funct, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Jagiellowicz, J (reprint author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Psychol, 1 Nicolls Rd, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.","jagiellowiczster@gmail.com","","Jagiellowicz, Jadzia/0000-0001-9065-7804; Xu, Xiaomeng/0000-0003-3695-4845","Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology [2007CB512300]","This work was partially supported by the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology Grant 2007CB512300 to X.

Comparing both groups, our data show that behaviorally lawyers conceived themselves as emotionally less involved during normative decision-making in general.

Most notably, the Christian participants deactivated the frontal network consisting of the medial and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally in response to speakers who they believed had healing abilities. An independent analysis across subjects revealed that this deactivation predicted the Christian participants' subsequent ratings of the speakers' charisma and experience of God's presence during prayer.

Several sentences described the behavior of a target person from which a strong trait could be inferred (trait diagnostic) or not (trait nondiagnostic). A direct contrast between spontaneous and intentional instructions revealed no significant differences, indicating that the same social mentalizing network was recruited. There was, however, a difference with respect to different brain areas that passed the significance threshold, suggesting that this common network was recruited to a different degree. Specifically, spontaneous inferences significantly recruited only core mentalizing areas, including the temporo-parietal junction and medial prefrontal cortex, whereas intentional inferences additionally recruited other brain areas, including the (pre)cuneus, superior temporal sulcus, temporal poles, and parts of the premotor and parietal cortex. These results suggest that intentional instructions invite observers to think more about the material they read, and consider it in many ways besides its social impact. Future research on the neurological underpinnings of trait inference might profit from the use of spontaneous instructions to get purer results that involve only the core brain areas in social judgment.","[Van Overwalle, Frank] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Psychol, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Seurinck, Ruth; Fias, Wim] Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","Van Overwalle, F (reprint author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Psychol, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.","Frank.VanOverwalle@vub.ac.be","Fias, Wim/D-6861-2010","Fias, Wim/0000-0002-5788-7306","Vrije Universiteit Brussel","This research was supported by an OZR Grant of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel to FVO.","","73","50","52","0","22","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND","1747-0919","1747-0927","","SOC NEUROSCI-UK","Soc.

In scientific terms, this is usually operationalized as an ability to vicariously feel others' mental and emotional experiences. Supporting this account, research demonstrates that watching others experience physical pain activates similar brain regions to the actual experience of pain itself. First-hand experience of social rejection also activates this network. The current work extends these findings by examining whether the ""pain"" network is similarly implicated in witnessing rejection, and whether emotional closeness modulates this response. We provide evidence for each of these suppositions, demonstrating: (a) that the pain network is activated when watching a friend suffer social rejection, and (b) that interpersonal closeness with that friend modulates this response. Further, we found that the inferior frontal gyrus, critical for representing others' mental and emotional states, mediates the relationship between emotional closeness and neural responses to watching the rejection of a friend.","[Beeney, Joseph E.; Franklin, Robert G., Jr.; Levy, Kenneth N.; Adams, Reginald B., Jr.] Penn State Univ, Dept Psychol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Adams, RB (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Psychol, 544 Moore Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.","rba10@psu.edu","Beeney, Joseph/R-7704-2016","Beeney, Joseph/0000-0001-8685-3597","Social Science Research Institute, Pennsylvania State University","This research was supported by a Social Science Research Institute research grant, Pennsylvania State University, to Reginald B.

Factors such as language development and educational style seem to influence its development. Some studies that have focused on transcultural aspects of ToM development have found differences between Asian and Western cultures. To date, however, little is known about transcultural differences in neural activation patterns as they relate to ToM functioning. Experimental methods: The aim of our study was to observe ToM functioning and differences in brain activation patterns, as assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This study included a sample of 18 healthy Japanese and 15 healthy Caucasian subjects living in Japan. We presented a ToM task depicting geometrical shapes moving in social patterns. We also administered questionnaires to examine empathy abilities and cultural background factors. Results: Behavioral data showed no significant group differences in the subjects' post-scan descriptions of the movies. The imaging results displayed stronger activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) in the Caucasian sample during the presentation of ToM videos. Furthermore, the task-associated activation of the MPFC was positively correlated with autistic and alexithymic features in the Japanese sample. Discussion: In summary, our results showed evidence of culturally dependent sociobehavioral trait patterns, which suggests that they have an impact on brain activation patterns during information processing involving ToM.","[Koelkebeck, Katja; Ohrmann, Patricia; Bauer, Jochen; Pedersen, Anya] Univ Munster, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Hirao, Kazuyuki; Kawada, Ryousaku; Miyata, Jun; Saze, Teruyasu; Ubukata, Shiho; Takahashi, Hidehiko; Murai, Toshiya] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Neuropsychiat, Kyoto, Japan; [Itakura, Shoji; Kanakogi, Yasuhiro] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Letters, Dept Psychol, Kyoto, Japan; [Sawamoto, Nobukatsu; Fukuyama, Hidenao] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Human Brain Res Ctr, Kyoto, Japan","Koelkebeck, K (reprint author), Univ Munster, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Albert Schweitzer Str 11, D-48149 Munster, Germany.","katja.koelkebeck@ukmuenster.de","Koelkebeck, Katja/F-3977-2014","Koelkebeck, Katja/0000-0002-0469-3997","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [PE 07550, 21890119]; DFG (German Research Foundation) [KO 4038/1-1]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan [20691401]; Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, Japan [20E-3]; Research Group for Schizophrenia; Astellas Pharma, Inc.; Mitsubishi Pharma Research Foundation","The study was supported by a research fellowship from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) (PE 07550 to K.

After summarizing influential theories of the field we turn to a methodological and theoretical reflection concerning the way to investigate moral judgment experimentally, as well as functional magnetic resonance imaging, one of the leading methods of behavioural and cognitive neuroscience. We relate this to general challenges within neuroethics, philosophy, and a multi-disciplinary view on human morality.

In the pattern mask condition, the amygdala discriminated between masked fearful and happy faces, but this effect manifested as a decrease in activation to fearful faces compared to happy faces.

We hypothesized that trait self-esteem would be related to social pain responsiveness, and we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to experimentally investigate this potential relationship. Participants (n = 26) performed a cyberball task, a computerized game of catch during which the participants were excluded from the game. Participants then rated the degree of social pain experienced during both inclusion in and exclusion from the game. Individuals with lower trait self-esteem reported increased social pain relative to individuals with higher trait self-esteem, and such individuals also demonstrated a greater degree of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex activation. A psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed a positive connectivity between the dorsal anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortices for the lower trait self-esteem group, and a corresponding negative connectivity for the higher trait self-esteem group. Heightened dorsal anterior cortex activity and a corresponding connection with the prefrontal cortex might be one possible explanation for the greater levels of social pain observed experienced by individuals with low trait self-esteem.","[Onoda, Keiichi; Yamaguchi, Shuhei] Shimane Univ, Fac Med, Dept Neurol, Izumo, Shimane 6938501, Japan; [Okamoto, Yasumasa; Yoshimura, Shinpei; Yamawaki, Sigeto] Hiroshima Univ, Dept Psychiat & Neurosci, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, Div Frontier,Minami Ku, Hiroshima 7348551, Japan; [Nakashima, Ken'ichiro; Nittono, Hiroshi; Ura, Mitsuhiro] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Integrated Arts & Sci, Dept Behav Sci, Higashihiroshima 7398521, Japan","Onoda, K (reprint author), Shimane Univ, Fac Med, Dept Neurol, 89-1 Enyacho, Izumo, Shimane 6938501, Japan.","onodak1@med.shimane-u.ac.jp","Onoda, Keiichi/C-5357-2012; Nittono, Hiroshi/C-4043-2009; Nakashima, Ken'ichiro/A-7975-2018","Nittono, Hiroshi/0000-0001-5671-609X; Onoda, Keiichi/0000-0002-3882-3446","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [19203030, 20790843]","This study was supported by a grant-in-aid for scientific research (A) 19203030 and for young scientists (B) 20790843 from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.","","43","88","93","6","44","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

In our model, each unit corresponds to a large number of neurons and may be roughly seen as abstracting the functional behavior exhibited by a single voxel under functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In the course of the dynamics, the units exchange portions of formal charge, which correspond to waves of activity in the underlying microscale neuronal circuit. The geometric model abstracts away the neuronal complexity and is mathematically tractable, which allows us to establish explicit results on its ground states and the resulting charge transfer graph modeling functional graph of the network. We show that, for a wide choice of parameters and geometrical setups, our model yields a scale-free functional connectivity with the exponent approaching 2, which is in agreement with previous empirical studies based on fMRI. The level of universality of the presented theory allows us to claim that the model does shed light on mesoscale functional self-organization phenomena of the nervous system, even without resorting to closer details of brain connectivity geometry which often remain unknown. The material presented here significantly extends our previous work where a simplified mean-field model in a similar spirit was constructed, ignoring the underlying network geometry.","[Piersa, Jaroslaw; Piekniewski, Filip; Schreiber, Tomasz] Nicholas Copernicus Univ, Fac Math & Comp Sci, PL-87100 Torun, Poland","Piersa, J (reprint author), Nicholas Copernicus Univ, Fac Math & Comp Sci, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.","pier-saj@mat.umk.pl; philip@mat.umk.pl; tomeks@mat.umk.pl","Piersa, Jaroslaw/E-7606-2014","","Polish Ministry of Scientific Research and Higher Education [N201 385234]; European Social Fund; Government of Poland; Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship in Poland","This work was supported in part by the Polish Ministry of Scientific Research and Higher Education under Grant N201 385234 (2008-2010).

Conjunction analysis revealed overlapping activation during both tasks. Activation in some of these conjunctly activated regions was even stronger during affective ToM than during emotion recognition, namely in the inferior frontal gyrus, the superior temporal sulcus, the temporal pole, and the amygdala. In contrast to previous studies investigating ToM, we found no activation in the anterior cingulate, commonly assumed as the key region for ToM. The results point to a close relationship of emotion recognition and affective ToM and can be interpreted as evidence for the assumption that at least basal forms of ToM occur by an embodied, non-cognitive process.","[Mier, Daniela; Esslinger, Christine; Kirsch, Peter] Cent Inst Mental Hlth, Div Imaging Psychiat, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany; [Mier, Daniela; Lis, Stefanie; Neuthe, Kerstin; Sauer, Carina; Esslinger, Christine; Gallhofer, Bernd; Kirsch, Peter] Univ Giessen, Ctr Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Giessen, Germany; [Mier, Daniela; Sauer, Carina; Kirsch, Peter] Cent Inst Mental Hlth, Dept Clin Psychol, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany; [Kirsch, Peter] Heidelberg Univ, Mannheim Sch Med, Heidelberg, Germany","Mier, D (reprint author), Cent Inst Mental Hlth, Div Imaging Psychiat, J 5, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany.","Daniela.Mier@zi-mannheim.de; Peter.Kirsch@zi-mannheim.de","X, Simon/F-4678-2011","Lis, Stefanie/0000-0002-8051-2756; Mier, Daniela/0000-0003-2518-7492; Kirsch, Peter/0000-0002-0817-1248","University of Giessen","Daniela Mier was supported by a fellowship for doctoral students from the University of Giessen.","","86","29","30","4","45","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0048-5772","1469-8986","","PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY","Psychophysiology","NOV","2010","47","6","","","","","1028","1039","","10.1111/j.1469-8986.2010.01031.x","","","","12","Psychology, Biological; Neurosciences; Physiology; Psychology; Psychology, Experimental","Psychology; Neurosciences & Neurology; Physiology","663HU","WOS:000282874800005","20456660","","","","2019-02-21","searchterm","searchterm_records_5001-5500.txt"

The relationship between animacy perception and brain areas commonly involved in social cognition, as well as the influence of particular motion patterns on animacy experience, however, remains to be further elucidated. We used a recently introduced paradigm for the systematic variation of motion properties, and employed functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify the neural mechanisms underlying animacy experience. Based on individual ratings of increased animacy experience the following brain regions of the ""social neural network"" (SNN), known to be involved in social cognitive processes, were recruited: insula, superior temporal gyros, fusiform gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex bilaterally. Decreased animacy experience was associated with increased neural activity in the inferior parietal and inferior frontal gyrus, key constituents of the human ""mirror neuron system"" (hMNS). These findings were corroborated when analyses were based on movement patterns alone, irrespective of subjective experience. Additionally to the areas found for increased animacy experience, an increase in interactive movements elicited activity in the amygdala and the temporal pole. In conclusion, the results suggest that the hMNS is recruited during a low-level stage of animacy judgment representing a basic disposition to detect the salience of movements, whereas the SNN appears to be a high-level processing component serving evaluation in social and mental inference.

We reevaluated this view by investigating whether the brain activity associated with expertise in object recognition is limited to category-selective cortex and specifically whether the extent of expertise-related activity manifests automatically or whether it can be top-down modulated. We conducted 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging studies comparing changes in hemodynamic activity associated with car expertise in a conventional 1-back task (Experiment 1) and when the task relevance of cars was explicitly manipulated (Experiment 2). Whole-brain analysis unveiled extensive expertise-related activity throughout the visual cortex, starting as early as V1 and extending into nonvisual areas. However, when the cars were task irrelevant, the expertise-related activity drastically diminished, indeed, becoming similar to the activity elicited by cars in novices.

This network is thought to support a baseline of brain activity, and is commonly referred to as the ""default network''. Although recent reports suggest that the PMC and mPFC are associated with affective, social, and self-referential processes, the relationship between these default network components and personality traits, especially those pertaining to social context, is poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Findings: In the current investigation, we assessed the relationship between PMC and mPFC deactivations and psychopathic personality traits using fMRI and a self-report measure. We found that PMC deactivations predicted traits related to egocentricity and mPFC deactivations predicted traits related to decision-making. Conclusions/Significance: These results suggest that the PMC and mPFC are associated with processes involving self-relevancy and affective decision-making, consistent with previous reports.

To this end, 52 participants viewed faces that were morphed to display 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, or 100% anger. As the percentage of anger in faces increased from 0 to 100%, faces were perceived as increasingly angry; however, relative to neutral facial expressions, startle amplitude was only potentiated to maximally angry faces.

This pattern of startle modulation suggests a categorical distinction between threatening (100% anger) and other facial expressions presented.

Using functional MRI (fMRI) and a ""trust game"" task involving iterative exchanges with fictive partners who acquire different reputations for reciprocity, we measured brain responses in 36 healthy adults when positive actions (entrust investment to partners) yield positive returns (reciprocity) and how these brain responses are modulated by partner reputation for repayment. Here we show that positive reciprocity robustly engages the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex. Moreover, this signal of reciprocity in the ventral striatum appears selectively in response to partners who have consistently returned the investment (e.g., a reputation for reciprocity) and is absent for partners who lack a reputation for reciprocity. These findings elucidate a fundamental brain mechanism, via reward-related neural substrates, by which human cooperative relationships are initiated and sustained.","[Phan, K.

One means by which social groups form and endure is by endowing group members with extraordinary prosocial proclivities, such as ingroup love, towards other group members. Here we examined the neural basis of extraordinary empathy and altruistic motivation in African-American and Caucasian-American individuals using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Our results indicate that empathy for ingroup members is neurally distinct from empathy for humankind, more generally. People showed greater response within anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral insula when observing the suffering of others, but African-American individuals additionally recruit medial prefrontal cortex when observing the suffering of members of their own social group. Moreover, neural activity within medial prefrontal cortex in response to pain expressed by ingroup relative to outgroup members predicted greater empathy and altruistic motivation for one's ingroup, suggesting that neurocognitive processes associated with self identity underlie extraordinary empathy and altruistic motivation for members of one's own social group. Taken together, our findings reveal distinct neural mechanisms of empathy and altruistic motivation in an intergroup context and may serve as a foundation for future research investigating the neural bases of intergroup prosociality, more broadly construed.

Conflicting definitions of neuromarketing have been proposed, and little is known about the actual practices of companies, physicians, and scientists involved in its practice. This article reviews the history of neuromarketing and uses an exploratory survey of neuromarketing Web sites to illustrate ethical issues raised by this new field. Neuromarketing, as currently practiced, is heterogeneous, as companies are offering a variety of technologies. Many companies employ academicians and professionals, but few list their clients or fees. Media coverage of neuromarketing appears disproportionately high compared to the paucity of peer-reviewed reports in the field. Companies may be making premature claims about the power of neuroscience to predict consumer behavior. Overall, neuromarketing has important implications for academic-industrial partnerships, the responsible conduct of research, and the public understanding of the brain. We explore these themes to uncover issues relevant to professional ethics, research, and policy. Of particular relevance to psychiatry, neuromarketing may be seen as an extension of the search for quantification and certainty in previously indefinite aspects of human behavior.

Previous studies have implicated the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) in the perception of social signals such as nonverbal emotional signals as well as in social cognitive functions like mentalizing/theory of mind. In the present study, we evaluated the relationships between trait emotional intelligence (El) and fMRI activation patterns in individual subjects during the multimodal perception of nonverbal emotional signals from voice and face. Trait El was linked to hemodynamic responses in the right pSTS, an area which also exhibits a distinct sensitivity to human voices and faces. Within all other regions known to subserve the perceptual audiovisual integration of human social signals (i.e., amygdala, fusiform gyms, thalamus), no such linked responses were observed. This functional difference in the network for the audiovisual perception of human social signals indicates a specific contribution of the pSTS as a possible interface between the perception of social information and social cognition.

To our knowledge, the neural basis of mentalizing has not yet been studied in a developmental perspective covering old age, so the aim of this work is to compare the neural basis of a specific aspect of ToM, the mindreading ability through the eyes, in healthy young and old subjects. Two groups of healthy adults (young: 25.2 years; old: 65.2 years) were submitted to an fMRI scanning while performing the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test, which requires the attribution of a mental state to the other person focussing only on the eye-gaze. There was no difference in the behavioural performances between young and old and both groups of subjects activated the pSTS and the TP, thus indicating that old people show no impairment of mentalizing circuits. However, a relevant shifting of the neural circuit implied in each group to solve the task emerged. Old subjects showed a more bilateral activation of frontal areas and a stronger involvement of the linguistic components of the mirror neuron system (i.e. area 44), as compared to young. Both young and old participants activated the non-linguistic components of the mirror neuron system, such as area 6. These findings are discussed taking into account the recent literature dealing with cognitive functions during normal aging. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

On an 'additive' model, agency and body-ownership are strongly related; the ability to control actions is a powerful cue to body-ownership. This view implies a component common to the senses of body-ownership and agency, plus possible additional components unique to agency. An alternative 'independence' model holds that agency and body-ownership are qualitatively different experiences, triggered by different inputs, and recruiting distinct brain networks. We tested these two specific models by investigating the sensory and motor aspects of body-representation in the brain using fMRI. Activations in midline cortical structures were associated with a sensory-driven sense of body-ownership, and were absent in agency conditions. Activity in the pre-SMA was linked to the sense of agency, but distinct from the sense of body-ownership. No shared activations that would support the additive model were found. The results support the independence model. Body-ownership involves a psychophysiological baseline, linked to activation of the brain's default mode network. Agency is linked to premotor and parietal areas involved in generating motor intentions and subsequent action monitoring. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present paper, we used a repetition suppression paradigm during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine brain systems that respond to the action-goals of shapes. Participants watched video clips of simple, geometrical shapes performing different 'take-object' goals. Repeated presentation of the same goal suppressed the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response in left anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS), a brain region known to distinguish the goals of human hand actions. This finding shows that left aIPS shows similar sensitivity to the action-goals of human and non-human agents. Our data complement previous work on animacy perception and mental state inference, which suggest components of the social brain are driven by the type of action comprehension that is engaged rather than by the form of the acting agent (i.e., human or shape). Further, the results have consequence for theories of goal understanding in situations without access to biological form or motion. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Although some ballet moves are performed by only one gender, male and female dancers train together and acquire visual knowledge of all ballet moves. Twenty-four expert ballet dancers (12 female) and matched non-expert participants viewed pairs of upright and inverted point light female and common dance movements. Visual discrimination between different exemplars of the same movement presented upright was significantly better in experts than controls, whilst no differences were found when the same stimuli were presented upside down. These results suggest expertise influences configural action processing. Within the expert group, effects were stronger for female participants than for males, whilst no differences were found between movement types. This observer gender effect could suggest an additional role for motor familiarity in action perception, over and above the visual experience.

Therefore, this network consisting of the amygdala, the anterior insula, the superior temporal sulcus (STS), and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) may rather be involved in more general relevance detection which should be independent of the sensory modality of the stimuli. In the current study, we used functional MRI to measure brain activations while participants either viewed pictures that varied in their emotional and social content or listened to sounds that varied along the same dimensions. The amygdala, the anterior insula, the STS, and the OFC showed increased activation during processing of emotional as well as social stimuli independent of the sensory modality in which the stimuli were presented. Moreover, social emotional stimuli elicited more pronounced activity in this network than stimuli with solely emotional or social content. These results indicate that the proposed network involved in relevance detection works independently of the source of relevance (emotional or social information mediated by the stimulus) and modality.

Such closeness can be described as including other in the self and be underpinned on social attachment system, which evolved from a redirection of nociceptive mechanisms. To what extent does imagining a loved-one differs from imagining an unfamiliar individual being in painful situations? In this functional MRI study, participants were exposed to animated stimuli depicting hands or feet in painful and non-painful situations, and instructed to imagine these scenarios from three different perspectives: self, loved-one and stranger after being primed with their respective photographs. In line with previous studies, the three perspectives were associated with activation of the neural network involved in pain processing. Specifically, adopting the perspective of a loved-one increased activity in the anterior cingulate cortex and insula, whereas imagining a stranger induced a signal increase in the right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and superior frontal gyrus. The closer the participants' relationships were with their partner, the greater the deactivation in the right TPJ. A negative effective connectivity between the right TPJ and the insula, and a positive one with the superior frontal gyrus were found when participants imagined the perspective of a stranger. These results demonstrate that intimacy affects the bottom-up information processing involved in empathy, as indicated by greater overlap between neural representations of the self and the other.

In the current work we used fMRI in combination with a semantic differential to cross-validate both methods and to improve the characterization of the basic factors constituting the semantic space. To this end we presented pictures of brands while recording subject's brain activity during an fMRI experiment. Results of the semantic differential arranged the brands in a semantic space illustrating their relationships to other cultural symbols. FMRI results revealed activation of the medial prefrontal cortex for brands that loaded high on the factor 'social competence', suggesting an involvement of a cortical network associated with social cognitions. In contrast, brands closely related to the factor 'potency' showed decreased activity in the superior frontal gyri, possibly related to working memory during task performance. We discuss the results as a different engagement of the prefrontal cortex when perceiving brands as cultural symbols.","[Schaefer, Michael; Rotte, Michael] Otto VonGuericke Univ Magdegurg, Dept Neurol, D-39120 Magdeburg, Germany","Schaefer, M (reprint author), Otto VonGuericke Univ Magdegurg, Dept Neurol, D-39120 Magdeburg, Germany.","mischa@neuro2.med.uni-magdeburg.de","","","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Bayer Vital GmbH","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and the Bayer Vital GmbH.","","28","13","13","1","15","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

Participants rated whether trait adjectives applied to themselves or their mothers, or judged their valence or font. Findings indicated that individual differences in interdependent self-construal correlated positively with increased activation in the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulated cortex when making judgments about one-self vs making judgments about one's mother.

We replicated the previous results in Han participants with the ventral medial prefrontal cortex and left anterior cingulate cortex showing stronger activation in self-processing when compared with other-processing conditions. However, no typical self-reference pattern was identified in Tibetan participants on behavioral or neural levels.

During a subsequent recognition memory task, participants were shown video clips depicting plays of the game, stemming either from previously-viewed game segments (targets) or from non-viewed portions of the same game (foils). After an old-new judgment, participants provided emotional valence and intensity ratings of the clips. A data driven approach was first used to decompose the fMRI signal acquired during free viewing of the game into spatially independent components. Correlations were then calculated between the identified components and post-scanning emotion ratings for successfully encoded targets. Two components were correlated with intensity ratings, including temporal lobe regions implicated in memory and emotional functions, such as the hippocampus and amygdala, as well as a midline fronto-cingulo-parietal network implicated in social cognition and self-relevant processing. These data were supported by a general linear model analysis, which revealed additional valence effects in fronto-striatal-insular regions when plays were divided into positive and negative events according to the fan's perspective. Overall, these findings contribute to our understanding of how emotional factors impact distributed neural systems to successfully encode dynamic, personally-relevant event sequences.","[Botzung, Anne; LaBar, Kevin S.; Kragel, Philip; Miles, Amanda; Rubin, David C.] Duke Univ, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Durham, NC 27708 USA","Botzung, A (reprint author), Duke Univ, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Box 90086,206 Psych Soc, Durham, NC 27708 USA.","anne.botzung@duke.edu","","Kragel, Philip/0000-0001-9463-6381","U.S. National Institutes of Health [R01 AG023123, 2 P01 NS041328]","The authors wish to thank Jennifer Labrecque for her work in developing the basketball questionnaires and stimuli, the Duke Department of Athletics for providing the video footage, and William Heath for video editing.

Diagnostic monitoring relies on expectations, whereby the failure to retrieve expected recollections prevents source memory misattributions (sometimes called the distinctiveness heuristic). Disqualifying monitoring relies on corroborative evidence, whereby the successful recollection of accurate source information prevents misattribution to an alternative source (sometimes called recall to reject). Using criterial recollection tests, we found that orienting retrieval toward distinctive recollections (colored pictures) reduced source memory misattributions compared with a control test in which retrieval was oriented toward less distinctive recollections (colored font). However, the corresponding neural activity depended on the type of monitoring engaged on these tests. Rejecting items based on the absence of picture recollections (i.e., the distinctiveness heuristic) decreased activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex relative to the control test, whereas rejecting items based on successful picture recollections (i.e., a recall-to-reject strategy) increased activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. There also was some evidence that these effects were differentially lateralized. This study provides the first neuroimaging comparison of these two recollection-based monitoring processes and advances theories of prefrontal involvement inmemory retrieval.","[Gallo, David A.] Univ Chicago, Dept Psychol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Scimeca, Jason] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Gallo, DA (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Psychol, 5848 S Univ Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.","dgallo@uchicago.edu","McDonough, Ian/O-9949-2015","McDonough, Ian/0000-0003-0907-8931; Scimeca, Jason/0000-0001-6945-4615","University of Chicago","This project was funded by grants from the University of Chicago's Office of the Vice President, Social Sciences Division, and Brain Research Imaging Center.

How these characters are processed, however, is inherently different for each language. We harnessed the unique property of homophone judgment in Japanese kanji to provide an analogous Chinese condition using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 33 native Japanese speakers. We compared two types of kanji: (I) kanji that usually evokes only one pronunciation to Japanese speakers, which is representative of most Chinese characters (monophonic character); (2) kanji that evoked multiple pronunciation candidates, which is typical in Japanese kanji (heterophonic character). Results showed that character pairs with multiple sound possibilities increased activation in posterior regions of the left, middle and inferior frontal gyri (MFG and IFG), the bilateral anterior insulae, and the left anterior cingulate cortex as compared with those of kanji with only one sound. The activity seen in the MFG, dorsal IFG, and ventral IFG in the left posterior lateral prefrontal cortex, which was thought to correspond with language components of orthography, phonology, and semantics, respectively, was discussed in regards to their potentially important roles in information selection among competing Sources of the components. A comparison with previous studies suggested that detailed analyses of activation in these language areas could explain differences between Japanese and Chinese, such as a greater involvement of the prefrontal language production regions for Japanese, whereas, for Chinese there is more phonological processing of inputs in the superior temporal gyrus.

In this study, we examined the experience of being liked in a group of 15- to 24-year-old: a cohort for whom forming friendships has a great degree of salience, and for whom the explicit representation of relationships is familiar from their frequent use of social networking technologies. Study participants (n = 19) were led to believe that other participants had formed an opinion on their likability based on their appearance in a photograph, and during fMRI scanning viewed the photographs of people who had purportedly responded favorably to them (alongside photographs of control participants). Results indicated that being liked activated primary reward- and self-related regions, including the nucleus accumbens, midbrain (in an area corresponding to the ventral tegmentum), ventromedial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex (including retrosplenial cortex), amygdala, and insula/opercular cortex. Participants showed greater activation of ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala in response to being liked by people that they regarded highly compared to those they regarded less so. Finally, being liked by the opposite compared to the same gender activated the right caudal orbitofrontal cortex and right anterior insula: areas important for the representation of primary somatic rewards. This study demonstrates that neural response to being liked has features that are consistent with response to other rewarding events, but it has additional features that reflect its intrinsically interpersonal character.

This is because, Greene maintains, the empirical studies establish that ""characteristically deontological"" moral thinking is driven by prepotent emotional reactions which are not a sound basis for morality in the contemporary world, while ""characteristically consequentialist"" thinking is a more reliable moral guide because it is characterized by greater cognitive command and control. In this essay, I argue that Greene does not succeed in drawing a strong statistical or causal connection between prepotent emotional reactions and deontological theory, and so does not undermine the legitimacy of deontological moral theories.

Taking a third-person perspective (3PP) as opposed to a first-person perspective (1PP) has been associated with brain activation in the inferior parietal cortex, the medial posterior cortex and the prefrontal cortex. Here we investigate for the first time the development of the neural network that yields cognitive perspective taking. Twelve adults (aged 25-32 years) and twelve school-aged children (aged 8-10 years) were investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Behaviorally, we found a decrease of reaction time differences between 3PP and 1PP with age indicating that adults were more efficient in processing a 3PP. Despite the reaction time differences both groups were equally accurate in their judgments. Brain imaging data indicated neural activity in the left inferior parietal cortex and precuneus for adults during 3PP as compared with 1PP judgments. Children additionally showed enhanced activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the right inferior perietal cortex. We found a significant interaction between groups and brain activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and in the right inferior parietal cortex. These results suggest that the development of the ability to reason about another person's mind accompanies a shift in activity from frontal to posterior brain regions and from bilateral to unilateral left inferior parietal cortex.

To investigate this question, we employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while participants performed Biological Motion (BM), Theory-of-Mind (ToM) and Moral Judgment (MJ) tasks. Importantly, for each task we used the same newly developed animated stimuli. Indicative of a common process, we identified small clusters of overlapping activity for BM and ToM in right pSTS and for ToM and MJ in bilateral pSTS and left TPJ. Indicative of distinct processes, on the contrary, we detected extensive dissociable activity for BM in right pSTS, for ToM in bilateral pSTS and left TPJ, and for MJ in bilateral pSTS and TPJ. Thus, our data provide strong evidence for a combined two-staged process account: (i) the parsing of a stream of visual-spatial information, represented by activity in right pSTS, where neighboring and overlapping clusters of increased responses were found for all three tasks; (ii) increasingly more complex processing of the communicative significance of other people's behavior, represented by hierarchically increasing activity in left pSTS and bilateral TPJ elicited by ToM and MJ.","[Bahnemann, Markus; Dziobek, Isabel; Wolf, Ingo; Heekeren, Hauke R.] Max Planck Inst Human Dev, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Bahnemann, Markus; Dziobek, Isabel; Wolf, Ingo; Heekeren, Hauke R.] Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, D-04303 Leipzig, Germany; [Bahnemann, Markus; Heekeren, Hauke R.] Charite, Dept Neurol, Berlin NeuroImaging Ctr, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Dziobek, Isabel; Prehn, Kristin; Wolf, Ingo; Heekeren, Hauke R.] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Educ & Psychol, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Bahnemann, M (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Human Dev, Lentzeallee 94, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.","markus.bahnemann@charite.de; hauke.heekeren@fu-berlin.de","Heekeren, Hauke/B-7739-2008","Heekeren, Hauke/0000-0001-7912-6826; Prehn, Kristin/0000-0002-0656-5323","Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (Berlin NeuroImaging Center, BNIC); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [HE 3347/2-1]","This study was financially supported by grants from the Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (Berlin NeuroImaging Center, BNIC) and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Emmy-Noether-Program (HE 3347/2-1)].

In some instances, however, fixed-effects (FFX) analysis can be more appropriate. Such analyses can be implemented by combining the Subjects' posterior densities according to Bayes' theorem either on a multivariate (Bayesian parameter averaging or BPA) or univariate basis (posterior variance weighted averaging or PVWA), or by applying DCM to time-series averaged across subjects beforehand (temporal averaging or TA). While all these FFX approaches have the advantage of allowing for Bayesian inferences on parameters a systematic comparison of their statistical properties has been lacking so far. Based on simulated data generated from a two-region network we examined the effects of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and population heterogeneity on group-level parameter estimates. Data sets were simulated assuming either a homogeneous large Population (N = 60) with constant connectivities across subjects OF a heterogeneous population with varying parameters. TA showed advantages at lower SNR but is limited in its applicability. Because BPA and PVWA take into account posterior (co)variance structure, they can yield non-intuitive results when only considering posterior means. This problem is relevant for high SNR data, pronounced parameter interdependencies and when FFX assumptions are violated (i.e. inhomogeneous groups). It diminishes with decreasing SNR and is absent for models with independent parameters or when FFX assumptions are appropriate. Group results obtained with these FFX approaches should therefore be interpreted carefully by considering estimates of dependencies among model parameters. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

A subculture of students at each university form social bonds with fellow fans, develop expertise in college basketball rules, team statistics, and individual players, and self-identify as a member of a fan group. The present study capitalized on the high personal investment of these fans and the strong affective tenor of a Duke-UNC basketball game to examine the neural correlates of emotional memory retrieval for a complex sporting event. Male fans watched a competitive, archived game in a social setting. During a subsequent functional magnetic resonance imaging session, participants viewed video clips depicting individual plays of the game that ended with the ball being released toward the basket. For each play, participants recalled whether or not the shot went into the basket. Hemodynamic signal changes time locked to correct memory decisions were analyzed as a function of emotional intensity and valence, according to the fan's perspective. Results showed intensity-modulated retrieval activity in midline cortical structures, sensorimotor cortex, the striatum, and the medial temporal lobe, including the amygdala. Positively valent memories specifically recruited processing in dorsal frontoparietal regions, and additional activity in the insula and medial temporal lobe for positively valent shots recalled with high confidence. This novel paradigm reveals how brain regions implicated in emotion, memory retrieval, visuomotor imagery, and social cognition contribute to the recollection of specific plays in the mind of a sports fan.","[Botzung, Anne; Rubin, David C.; Miles, Amanda; Cabeza, Roberto; LaBar, Kevin S.] Duke Univ, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Durham, NC 27708 USA","LaBar, KS (reprint author), Duke Univ, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Box 90999, Durham, NC 27708 USA.","klabar@duke.edu","","","United States National Institutes of Health [R01 AG023123, P01 NS041328]","This work was supported by United States National Institutes of Health Grants R01 AG023123 and P01 NS041328.

This region is also reliably activated by observation of meaningless oral and manual actions. In this study we directly compared the extent to which activation in posterior superior temporal cortex is modulated by linguistic knowledge irrespective of differences in language form. We used a novel cross-linguistic approach in two groups of volunteers who differed in their language experience. Using fMRI, we compared deaf native signers of British Sign Language (BSL), who were also proficient speech-readers of English (i.e., two languages) with hearing people who could speechread English, but knew no BSL (i.e., one language). Both groups were presented with BSL signs and silently spoken English words, and were required to respond to a signed or spoken target. The interaction of group and condition revealed activation in the superior temporal cortex, bilaterally, focused in the posterior superior temporal gyri (pSTC, BA 42/22). In hearing people, these regions were activated more by speech than by sign, but in deaf respondents they showed similar levels of activation for both language forms - suggesting that posterior superior temporal regions are highly sensitive to language knowledge irrespective of the mode of delivery of the stimulus material.

On the basis of experiments in rodents and clinical data, the present study addresses the hypothesis of bilateral projection of facial nociceptive input onto the spinal trigeminal nucleus (STN) in healthy humans. Nociceptive processing in the brainstem was investigated by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 18 healthy volunteers. Heat stimuli (39, 43, 46A degrees C) were applied by a Peltier type thermode to the left forehead (V1) and the left mental region (V3). Analyses of fMRI data were performed with SPM2 and BrainVoyager software. A region-of-interest approach analyzed local activation in the STN. Heat evoked significant bilateral activation in the STN (P < 0.01, T > 2.8). Contralateral activation was more frequent during stimulation of the V1 than of the V3 region. Whereas activation by V1 stimulation was located in caudal STN, V3 stimulation induced activity in more rostral parts of the STN. Functional MRI data in humans suggest bilateral brainstem activation when heat is applied to the face. Contralateral brainstem activity is more pronounced by stimulation of V1 as compared to V3. The results indicate similar nociceptive processing in humans and rodents and may explain clinical findings.","[Ristic, Dejan; Ellrich, Jens] Univ Aalborg, Fac Med, Dept Hlth Sci & Technol, Med Physiol & Expt Pharmacol Grp,Ctr Sensory Moto, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark; [Kubina, Baerbel] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Neurosurg, Expt Neurosurg Sect, Aachen, Germany; [Weber, Jochen] Brain Innovat BV, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Weber, Jochen] Columbia Univ, Dept Psychol, Social Cognit Affect Neurosci Unit, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Stracke, Christian Paul] Alfried Krupp Hosp Essen, Dept Neuroradiol, Essen, Germany; [Forster, Clemens] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Physiol & Expt Pathophysiol, Erlangen, Germany","Ellrich, J (reprint author), Univ Aalborg, Fac Med, Dept Hlth Sci & Technol, Med Physiol & Expt Pharmacol Grp,Ctr Sensory Moto, Fredrik Bajers Vej 7D2, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark.","jellrich@hst.aau.dk","","","Interdisciplinary Center for Clinical Research at RWTH Aachen University","This work was supported by the Interdisciplinary Center for Clinical Research at RWTH Aachen University.

A significant component of human social communication depends upon interpreting and responding to another person's prosodic tone as well as one's own ability to produce prosodic speech. However there has been little work on whether the perception and production of prosody share common neural processes, and if so, how these might correlate with individual differences in social ability. Methods: The aim of the present study was to determine the degree to which perception and production of prosody rely on shared neural systems. Using fMRI, neural activity during perception and production of a meaningless phrase in different prosodic intonations was measured. Regions of overlap for production and perception of prosody were found in premotor regions, in particular the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Activity in these regions was further found to correlate with how high an individual scored on two different measures of affective empathy as well as a measure on prosodic production ability. Conclusions: These data indicate, for the first time, that areas that are important for prosody production may also be utilized for prosody perception, as well as other aspects of social communication and social understanding, such as aspects of empathy and prosodic ability.","[Aziz-Zadeh, Lisa; Sheng, Tong] Univ So Calif, Brain & Creat Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Aziz-Zadeh, Lisa] Univ So Calif, Dept Occupat Sci, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Aziz-Zadeh, Lisa; Sheng, Tong] Univ So Calif, Grad Program Neurosci, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Gheytanchi, Anahita] Pacific Grad Sch Psychol, Palo Alto, CA USA","Aziz-Zadeh, L (reprint author), Univ So Calif, Brain & Creat Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.","lazizzad@usc.edu","Sheng, Tong/C-6306-2019","Sheng, Tong/0000-0003-1067-7608","Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [R03HD057594]; James H.

Yet sometimes we need to be able to rapidly appraise whether an interaction between two people represents a real threat for one of them Father than an innocent tease. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated whether small differences in the body language of two interacting people are picked up by the brain even if observers are performing an unrelated task. Fourteen participants were scanned while watching 3-s movies (192 trials and 96 scrambles) showing a male person either threatening or teasing a female one. In one task condition, observers categorized the interaction as threatening or teasing, and in the other, they monitored randomly appearing dots and categorized the color. Our results clearly show that right amygdala responds more to threatening than to teasing situations irrespective of the observers' task. When observers' attention is not explicitly directed to the situation, this heightened amygdala activation goes together with increased activity in body sensitive regions in fusiform gyrus, extrastriate body area-human motion complex and superior temporal sulcus and is associated with a better behavioral performance of the participants during threatening situations. In addition, regions involved in action observation (inferior frontal gyrus, temporoparietal junction, and inferior parietal lobe) and preparation (premotor, putamen) show increased activation for threat videos. Also regions involved in processing moral violations (temporoparietal junction, hypothalamus) reacted selectively to the threatening interactions.

There is also much excitement about using neuroimaging to detect lies and deception in legal and national security contexts. Despite claims of neuroimaging's revolutionary nature, numerous questions should be answered about their validity and reliability before they become widely adopted. Neuroscientists still do not fully understand the link between brain activity and behavior or memory formation. Important legal and ethical questions remain unresolved, particularly around the potential effect on juries and judges of colorful, but scientifically unproven, brain images.

Methods Nineteen abstinent MA abusers (mean age of 36.06 years, range 31-52 years) and 19 healthy subjects (mean age of 37.05 years, range 33-42 years) participated in this study. A visual fMRI activation paradigm was used, comprising a series of cartoons, each depicting a short story. There were two categories of stories: empathy (Empathy) and Physical causality (Physical). fMRI images were acquired using a 3.0 T whole-body scanner. All fMRI data were analyzed using MATLAB v. 7.2 and SPM5. Results Both MA subjects and controls exhibited activation in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Despite this similarity in activation patterns, we found that the two groups differed in the activation of several cortical regions associated with the processing of empathy information. Hypoactivations of the orbitofrontal cortex, temporal poles, and hippocampus in MA abusers relative to healthy subjects suggests that the ability of empathic response could be compromised in abstinent MA abusers (p < 0.05, corrected for a small volume). Conclusions Functional impairments in the empathic neural network caused by MA may contribute to the misunderstanding of others and to the erosion of social interactions in MA abusers.

Over the last few decades, this remarkable ability has captivated the attention of philosophers, primatologists, clinical and developmental psychologists, anthropologists, social psychologists, and cognitive neuroscientists. Most would agree that the capacity to reason about others' mental states is innately prepared, essential for successful human social interaction. Whether this ability is culturally tuned, however, remains entirely uncharted on both the behavioral and neural levels. Here we provide the first behavioral and neural evidence for an intracultural advantage (better performance for same- vs. other-culture) in mental state decoding in a sample of native Japanese and white American participants. We examined the neural correlates of this intracultural advantage using fMRI, revealing greater bilateral posterior superior temporal sulci recruitment during same- versus other-culture mental state decoding in both cultural groups.

This network consists of the superior temporal sulcus, temporoparietal junction, medial prefrontal cortex, temporal poles, and precuneus. Little is known, however, about the neural substrate underlying Theory of Mind processes in close to real-life conditions. To investigate those processes in more naturalistic settings, we used an fMRI adaption of the video-based Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC; Dziobek et al., 2006), which considers separate analysis of implicit mental state reasoning during rapidly changing perceptual cues as demanded in naturalistic settings and explicit mental state reasoning. We analyzed fMRI data by means of both a standard general linear model (GLM) approach and a tensor probabilistic independent component analysis (T-PICA), which is a novel model-free approach that allows decomposition of activation into independent spatio-temporally coherent functional networks. The model-based GLM approach revealed the typical explicit mental state reasoning network, Complementary to the GLM approach, the model-free T-PICA approach showed that those regions are also recruited during implicit mental state reasoning and that they are represented in three independent, functionally connected networks. The first component, mediating face processing and recognition, comprises the occipito-parietotemporal cortices, while the second component, involved in language comprehension, comprises the temporal lobes, lateral prefrontal cortex, and precuneus. The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and the precuneus comprise the third component, which is likely responsible for self-referential mental activity. These results show that the mental state reasoning network can be decomposed into circumscribed functional networks mediating differential aspects of Theory of Mind. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

However, much of the research to date has focused on the encoding of neutral verbal and visual information. The present fMRI study investigated age differences in a social encoding task while participants made judgments about the self or another person. Although previous studies identified an intact self-reference effect with age, subserved by robust engagement of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) by both young and older adults, we identified a number of age differences. In regions including superior mPFC, inferior prefrontal cortex, and anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, young and older adults exhibited reversals in the pattern of activity for self and other conditions. Whereas young primarily evidenced subsequent forgetting effects in the self-reference condition, older adults demonstrated subsequent memory effects in the other-reference condition. These results indicate fundamental differences across the age groups in the engagement of elaborative encoding processes. We suggest that older adults may encode information about the self in a more normative manner, whereas young adults focus on encoding the unique aspects of the self and distinguishing the self from others.

We hypothesized that similar learning and valuation signals may underlie social expectancy violations. Here, we explore the neural correlates of social expectancy violation signals along the universal person-perception dimensions trait warmth and competence. In this context, social learning may result from expectancy violations that occur when a target is inconsistent with an a priori schema. Expectancy violation may activate neural regions normally implicated in prediction error and valuation during appetitive and aversive conditioning. Using fMRI, we first gave perceivers high warmth or competence behavioral information that led to dispositional or situational attributions for the behavior. Participants then saw pictures of people responsible for the behavior; they represented social groups either inconsistent (rated low on either warmth or competence) or consistent (rated high on either warmth or competence) with the behavior information. Warmth and competence expectancy violations activate striatal regions that represent evaluative and prediction error signals. Social cognition regions underlie consistent expectations. These findings suggest that regions underlying reinforcement learning may work in concert with social cognition regions in warmth and competence social expectancy.

In the current fMRI study we aimed at exploring the neural correlates of the positive consequences of being imitated by means of an observation paradigm.

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine age-related changes in the neural correlates of social acceptance and rejection processing. Participants from four age groups participated in the study: pre-pubertal children (8-10 years), early adolescents (12-14 years), older adolescents (16-17 years) and young adults (19-25 years). During the experiment, participants were presented with unfamiliar faces of peers and were asked to predict whether they expected to be liked or disliked by the other person, followed by feedback indicating acceptance or rejection. Results showed that activation in the ventral mPFC and striatum to social feedback was context-dependent; there was increased activation when participants had positive expectations about social evaluation, and increased activation following social acceptance feedback. Age-related comparisons revealed a linear increase in activity with age in these brain regions for positive expectations of social evaluation. Similarly, a linear increase with age was found for activation in the striatum, ventral mPFC, OFC, and lateral PFC for rejection feedback. No age-related differences in neural activation were shown for social acceptance feedback. Together, these results provide important insights in the developmental trajectories of brain regions implicated in social and affective behavior.","[Moor, Bregtje Gunther] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Psychol, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Moor, Bregtje Gunther; van Leijenhorst, Linda; Rombouts, Serge A.

Moreover, this work has not examined adolescents who may frequently witness and empathize with others that experience negative social experiences such as peer rejection. Here, we examined neural activity among early adolescents observing social exclusion compared to observing inclusion, and how this activity related to both trait empathy and subsequent prosocial behavior. Participants were scanned while they observed an individual whom they believed was being socially excluded. At least one day prior to the scan they reported their trait empathy, and following the scan they wrote emails to the excluded victim that were rated for prosocial behavior (e.g., helping, comforting). Observing exclusion compared to inclusion activated regions involved in mentalizing (i.e., dorsomedial prefrontal cortex), particularly among highly empathic individuals. Additionally, individuals who displayed more activity in affective, pain-related regions during observed exclusion compared to inclusion subsequently wrote more prosocial emails to excluded victims. Overall findings suggest that when early adolescents witness social exclusion in their daily lives, some may actually 'feel the pain' of the victims and act more prosocially toward them as a result.","[Masten, Carrie L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Pfeifer, Jennifer H.] Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA","Masten, CL (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, 1285 Franz Hall,Box 951563, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.","cmasten@ucla.edu","","","Elizabeth Munsterberg Koppitz Award; Ruth L.

Very similar neural networks were involved in the processing of angry and happy faces in adults and children, including the amygdala and prefrontal areas. In general, children showed heightened amygdala activation in response to emotional faces relative to adults. While children showed stronger amygdala activation in response to angry adult compared to angry child faces, adults showed stronger amygdala activation for angry child faces.

To determine whether Experience Corps (EC), a social service program, would improve age-vulnerable executive functions and increase activity in brain regions in a high-risk group through increased cognitive and physical activity. Methods. Eight community-dwelling, older female volunteers and nine matched wait-list controls were recruited to serve in the ongoing EC: Baltimore program in three elementary schools. We employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) preintervention and postintervention to examine whether EC volunteers improved executive function and showed increased activity in the prefrontal cortex relative to controls. fMRI volunteers were trained and placed with other volunteers 15 h/wk for 6 months during the academic year to assist teachers in kindergarten through third grade to promote children's literacy and academic achievement. Results. Participants were African American and had low education, low income, and low Mini-Mental State Examination scores (M = 24), indicative of elevated risk for cognitive impairment. Volunteers exhibited intervention-specific increases in brain activity in the left prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex over the 6-month interval relative to matched controls. Neural gains were matched by behavioral improvements in executive inhibitory ability. Conclusions. Using fMRI, we demonstrated intervention-specific short-term gains in executive function and in the activity of prefrontal cortical regions in older adults at elevated risk for cognitive impairment. These pilot results provide proof of concept for use-dependent brain plasticity in later life, and, that interventions designed to promote health and function through everyday activity may enhance plasticity in key regions that support executive function.","[Carlson, Michelle C.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Aging & Hlth, Dept Mental Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Erickson, Kirk I.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Psychol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Kramer, Arthur F.; Voss, Michelle W.] Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Technol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Mielke, Michelle] Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Baltimore, MD USA; [McGill, Sylvia] Greater Homewood Community Corp, Baltimore, MD USA; [Seeman, Teresa] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Med, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Fried, Linda P.] Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, New York, NY USA","Carlson, MC (reprint author), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Aging & Hlth, Dept Mental Hlth, 2024 E Monument St,Suite 2-700, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.","mcarlson@jhsph.edu","","Mielke, Michelle/0000-0001-7177-1185","Research Career Development Core of the Older Americans Independence Center [P30-AG021334]","This work was supported in part by the Research Career Development Core of the Older Americans Independence Center (P30-AG021334) and a gift from S.

Little is known, however, about how neural representations of an anticipated incentive might be influenced by the available alternatives. We used event-related FMRI to investigate the activation in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), while we varied the available alternative incentives in a monetary incentive delay task. Some task blocks included only uncertain gains and losses; others included the same uncertain gains and losses intermixed with certain gains and losses. The availability of certain gains and losses increased NAcc activation for uncertain losses and decreased the difference between uncertain gains and losses. We suggest that this pattern of activation can result from reference point changes across blocks, and that the worst available loss may serve as an important anchor for NAcc activation. These findings imply that NAcc activation represents anticipated incentive value relative to the current context of available alternative gains and losses.","[Cooper, Jeffrey C.; Hollon, Nick G.; Wimmer, G.

Higgins, 2005), the authors hypothesized that brain activity supporting working memory (WM) would be related to Intellect but not to Openness. To test this hypothesis, the authors used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to scan a sample of 104 healthy adults as they performed a difficult WM task. Intellect (and not Openness) was found to correlate with WM accuracy and with accuracy-related brain activity, in left lateral anterior prefrontal cortex and posterior medial frontal cortex. Neural activity in these regions mediated the association between Intellect and WM performance, implicating these regions in the neural substrate of Intellect. Intellect was also correlated significantly with scores on tests of intelligence and WM capacity, but the association of Intellect with brain activity could not be entirely explained by cognitive ability.","[DeYoung, Colin G.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Psychol, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Shamosh, Noah A.; Green, Adam E.; Gray, Jeremy R.] Yale Univ, Dept Psychol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Braver, Todd S.] Washington Univ, Dept Psychol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Gray, Jeremy R.] Yale Univ, Interdepartmental Neurosci Program, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","DeYoung, CG (reprint author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Psychol, 75 E River Rd, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.","cdeyoung@umn.edu; jeremy.gray@yale.edu","Gray, Jeremy/A-2635-2013","Braver, Todd/0000-0002-2631-3393","NIMH NIH HHS [MH R01 6608, F32 MH077382, F32 MH077382-01]","","","63","99","100","1","26","AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC","WASHINGTON","750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA","0022-3514","","","J PERS SOC PSYCHOL","J.

It has been argued that the mirror neuron system may be the key neural locus of such coordination. Instead, here we show that such coordination recruits two separable sets of areas: one that could translate between motor and visual codes and one that could integrate these information to achieve common goals. The former includes regions of the putative mirror neuron system, the latter, regions of the prefrontal, posterior parietal and temporal lobe adjacent to the putative mirror neuron system. Both networks were more active while participants cooperated with a human agent, responding to their actions, compared to a computer that did not, evidencing their social dimension. This finding shows that although the putative mirror neuron system can play a critical role in joint actions by translating both agents' actions into a common code, the flexible remapping of our own actions with those of others required during joint actions seems to be performed outside of the putative mirror neuron system.

Subjective evaluations and brain-imaging findings converge to propose that hypnotic suggestion strongly modulates sensory processing. To reveal the brain regions that mediate such a modulation, we analyzed data from a functional-magnetic-resonance-imaging study on hypnotic-suggestion-induced pain on 14 suggestible subjects. Activation strengths in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during initiation of suggestion for pain correlated positively with the subjective intensity of the subsequent suggestion-induced pain, as well as with the strengths of the maximum pain-related activation in the in the secondary somatosensory (SII) cortex. Furthermore, activation of the insula and the anterior cingulate cortex predicted the pain-related SII activation.

However, there are very few fMRI studies using dynamic emotional stimuli. The aim of this study was (1) to introduce and evaluate a new stimulus database of static and dynamic emotional facial expressions according to arousal and recognizability investigated by a rating by both participants of the present fMRI study and by an external sample of 30 healthy women, (2) to examine the neural networks involved in emotion perception of static and dynamic facial stimuli separately, and (3) to examine the impact of motion on the emotional processing of dynamic compared to static face stimuli. A total of 16 females participated in the present fMRI study performing a passive emotion perception task including static and dynamic faces of neutral, happy and disgusted expressions. Comparing dynamic stimuli to static faces indicated enhanced emotion-specific brain activation patterns in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) including the amygdala (AMG), fusiform gyrus (FG), superior temporal gyrus (STG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and occipital and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). These regions have been discussed to be associated with emotional memory encoding, the perception of threat, facial identity, biological motion, the mirror neuron system, an increase of emotional arousal, and reward processing, respectively. Post hoc ratings of the dynamic stimuli revealed a better recognizability in comparison to the static stimuli. In conclusion, dynamic facial expressions might provide a more appropriate approach to examine the processing of emotional face perception than static stimuli. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Across age, gender, religion and ethnicity, people's judgments on classic dilemmas are sensitive to the same moral principles. In many cases, moral judgments depend not only on the outcome of the action, but on the agent's beliefs and intentions at the time of action. For example, we blame agents who attempt but fail to harm others, while generally forgiving agents who harm others accidentally and unknowingly. Nevertheless, as we report here, there are individual differences in the extent to which observers exculpate agents for accidental harms. Furthermore, we find that the extent to which innocent intentions are taken to mitigate blame for accidental harms is correlated with activation in a specific brain region during moral judgment. This brain region, the right temporo-parietal junction, has been previously implicated in reasoning about other people's thoughts, beliefs, and intentions in moral and non-moral contexts.

The level of curiosity when reading questions was correlated with activity in caudate regions previously suggested to be involved in anticipated reward. This finding led to a behavioral study, which showed that subjects spent more scarce resources (either limited tokens or waiting time) to find out answers when they were more curious. The functional imaging also showed that curiosity increased activity in memory areas when subjects guessed incorrectly, which suggests that curiosity may enhance memory for surprising new information.

It has been proposed that automatic attentional orienting driven by social cues (social orienting) involves a different neural network from automatic orienting driven by nonsocial cues. However, previous neuroimaging studies on social orienting have only compared gaze cues to symbolic cues, which typically engage top-down mechanisms. Therefore, we directly compared the neural activity involved in social orienting to that involved in purely automatic nonsocial orienting. Twenty participants performed a spatial cueing task consisting of social (gaze) cues and automatic nonsocial (peripheral squares) cues presented at short and long stimulus (cue-to-target) onset asynchronies (SOA), while undergoing fMRI. Behaviorally, a facilitation effect was found for both cue types at the short SOA, while an inhibitory effect (inhibition of return: IOR) was found only for nonsocial cues at the long SOA. Imaging results demonstrated that social and nonsocial cues recruited a largely overlapping fronto-parietal network. In addition, social cueing evoked greater activity in occipito-temporal regions at both SOAs, while nonsocial cueing recruited greater subcortical activity, but only for the long SOA (when IOR was found). A control experiment, including central arrow cues, confirmed that the occipito-temporal activity was at least in part due to the social nature of the cue and not simply to the location of presentation (central vs. peripheral). These results suggest an evolutionary trajectory for automatic orienting, from predominantly subcortical mechanisms for nonsocial orienting to predominantly cortical mechanisms for social orienting.","[Greene, Deanna J.; Mooshagian, Eric; Zaidel, Eran] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Kaplan, Jonas T.; Iacoboni, Marco] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Ahmanson Lovelace Brain Mapping Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Greene, DJ (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, 1285 Franz Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.","djgreene@ucla.edu","","Mooshagian, Eric/0000-0001-5998-8445","NCRR NIH HHS [RR13642, M01 RR000865, C06 RR012169, RR00865, P41 RR013642]","","","56","45","45","1","12","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","0340-0727","1430-2772","","PSYCHOL RES-PSYCH FO","Psychol.

Flexible, rapid and precise realization of intentions and goals relies on the brain learning to control its actions on external objects and to predict the consequences of this control. Neural mechanisms that mimic the input-output properties of our own body and other objects can be used to support prediction and control, and such mechanisms are called internal models. We first summarize functional neuroimaging, behavioral and computational studies of the brain mechanisms related to acquisition, modular organization, and the predictive switching of internal models mainly for tool use. These mechanisms support predictive control and flexible switching of intentional actions. We then review recent studies demonstrating that internal models are crucial for the execution of not only immediate actions but also higher-order cognitive functions, including optimization of behaviors toward long-term goals, social interactions based on prediction of others' actions and mental states, and language processing. These studies suggest that a concept of internal models can consistently explain the neural mechanisms and computational principles needed for fundamental sensorimotor functions as well as higher-order cognitive functions.","[Imamizu, Hiroshi] Natl Inst Informat & Commun Technol, Biol Informat & Commun Technol Grp, Keihanna Sci City, Kyoto 6190288, Japan; [Imamizu, Hiroshi; Kawato, Mitsuo] Adv Telecommun Res Inst Int, Computat Neurosci Labs, Keihanna Sci City, Kyoto 6190288, Japan","Imamizu, H (reprint author), Natl Inst Informat & Commun Technol, Biol Informat & Commun Technol Grp, 2-2-2 Hikaridai, Keihanna Sci City, Kyoto 6190288, Japan.","imamizu@gmail.com","","Imamizu, Hiroshi/0000-0003-1024-0051","","","","84","50","50","0","16","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","0340-0727","1430-2772","","PSYCHOL RES-PSYCH FO","Psychol.

These two modes of action selection have distinct neural bases, but few studies investigated how the mode of action selection affects the subjective experience of action. We measured the experience of action using the subjective compression of the interval between actions and their effects, known as 'temporal binding'. Participants performed either a left or a right key press, either in response to a specific cue, or as they freely chose. Moreover, the time of each keypress could either be explicitly cued to occur in one of two designated time intervals, or participants freely chose in which interval to act. Each action was followed by a specific tone. Participants judged the time of their actions or the time of the tone. Temporal binding was found for both internally generated and for stimulus-based actions. However, the amount of binding depended on whether or not both the choice and the timing of action were selected in the same way. Stronger binding was observed when both action choice and action timing were internally generated or externally specified, compared to conditions where the two parameters were selected by different routes. Our result suggests that temporal action-effect binding depends on how actions are selected. Binding is strongest when actions result from a single mode of selection.","[Wenke, Dorit] Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Dept Psychol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Waszak, Florian; Haggard, Patrick] UCL, Inst Cognit Neurosci, London, England; [Waszak, Florian] CNRS, Lab Psychol Percept, Paris, France; [Waszak, Florian] Univ Paris 05, Paris, France","Wenke, D (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Dept Psychol, Stephanstr 1A, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.","wenke@cbs.mpg.de","Wenke, Dorit/K-8278-2012; Haggard, Patrick/A-5081-2010","Haggard, Patrick/0000-0001-7798-793X","Economic and Social Research Council [RES-000-23-1571]","","","47","16","16","0","5","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","0340-0727","1430-2772","","PSYCHOL RES-PSYCH FO","Psychol.

Analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired during training revealed a significant increase in task-related cue sensitivity in a right posterior putamen-globus pallidus region as training progressed. These results provide evidence for a shift from goal-directed to habit-based control of instrumental actions in humans, and suggest that cue-driven activation in a specific region of dorsolateral posterior putamen may contribute to the habitual control of behavior in humans.","[Tricomi, Elizabeth] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Psychol, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Balleine, Bernard W.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Balleine, Bernard W.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Brain Res Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [O'Doherty, John P.] CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [O'Doherty, John P.] CALTECH, Computat & Neural Syst Program, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [O'Doherty, John P.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Psychol, Dublin, Ireland; [O'Doherty, John P.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Inst Neurosci, Dublin, Ireland; [Balleine, Bernard W.] Univ Sydney, Brain & Mind Res Inst, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Tricomi, E (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Psychol, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.","etricomi@psychology.rutgers.edu","O'Doherty, John/F-1204-2013","Balleine, Bernard/0000-0001-8618-7950; Tricomi, Elizabeth/0000-0002-3659-2656","Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; National Institute of Mental Health [RO3MH075763]","We thank Saori Tanaka, Signe Bray, Jan GlAscher, Nicole Tetrault and Ralph Lee for their assistance.

This article considers the implications of these developments for understanding managerial and organizational decision making. Over the past two decades, researchers have made considerable progress in distinguishing intuition from closely-related constructs such as instinct and insight and the interplay between these non-conscious forms of cognition and explicit reasoning processes is now better understood. In the wake of significant theoretical and methodological convergence centred on dual-process theories of reasoning, judgment and social cognition, supported by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, several of the foundational assumptions underpinning classic theories and frameworks in strategic management and entrepreneurship research are being called into question. Old models based on a simplistic left brain/right brain dichotomy are giving way to more sophisticated conceptions, in which intuitive and analytical approaches to decision making are underpinned by complex neuropsychological systems. In the light of these advances, the authors offer their reflections on what this all means for the assessment, development and management of intuition in the workplace. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Findings unique to adolescents indicated that activity in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (subACC) related to greater distress, and that activity in the ventral striatum related to less distress and appeared to play a role in regulating activity in the subACC and other regions involved in emotional distress. Finally, adolescents with higher rejection sensitivity and interpersonal competence scores displayed greater neural evidence of emotional distress, and adolescents with higher interpersonal competence scores also displayed greater neural evidence of regulation, perhaps suggesting that adolescents who are vigilant regarding peer acceptance may be most sensitive to rejection experiences.","[Masten, Carrie L.; Eisenberger, Naomi I.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Masten, Carrie L.; Borofsky, Larissa A.; Mazziotta, John C.; Dapretto, Mirella] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Ahmanson Lovelace Brain Mapping Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Borofsky, Larissa A.; Mazziotta, John C.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Semel Inst Neurosci & Human Behav, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Pfeifer, Jennifer H.] Univ Oregon, Dept Psychol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [McNealy, Kristin; Mazziotta, John C.; Dapretto, Mirella] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Neurosci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [McNealy, Kristin; Dapretto, Mirella] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles Ctr Culture Brain & Dev, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Mazziotta, John C.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Neurol, Dept Pharmacol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Mazziotta, John C.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Radiol Sci, David Geffen Sch Med, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Dapretto, Mirella] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychiat & Biobehav Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Mazziotta, John C.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Brain Res Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","Masten, CL (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Psychol, 1285 Franz Hall,Box 951563, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.","cmasten@ucla.edu","","Del Piero, Larissa/0000-0002-4407-5472","Santa Fe Institute Consortium; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship; Elizabeth Munsterberg Koppitz Award; Ruth L.

The movie highlights the characters' bodily sensations (often pain) and mental states (beliefs, desires, emotions), and is a feasible experiment for young children. Here we report three main findings: (1) ToM and pain networks are functionally distinct by age 3 years, (2) functional specialization increases throughout childhood, and (3) functional maturity of each network is related to increasingly anti-correlated responses between the networks.

Preference-inferring is an important aspect of the theory of mind (TOM). Many previous studies have shown that attachment style is closely related to TOM ability. However, little is known about the effects of adult attachment style on preferences inferring under different levels of certainty. Here, we investigated how adult attachment style affects neural activity underlying preferences inferred under different levels of certainty by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The fMRI results demonstrated that adult attachment influenced the activation of anterior insula (AI) and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in response to ambiguous preference-inferring. More specifically, in the ambiguous preference condition, the avoidant attached groups exhibited a significantly enhanced activation than secure and anxious attached groups in left IPL; the anxious attached groups exhibited a significantly reduced activation secure attached group in left IPL. In addition, the anxious attached groups exhibited a significantly reduced activation than secure and avoidant attached groups in left AI. These results were also further confirmed by the subsequent PPI analysis. The results from current study suggest that, under ambiguous situations, the avoidant attached individuals show lower sensitivity to the preference of other individuals and need to invest more cognitive resources for preference-reasoning; while compared with avoidant attached group, the anxious attached individuals express high tolerance for uncertainty and a higher ToM proficiency. Results from the current study imply that differences in preference-inferring under ambiguous conditions associated with different levels of individual attachment may explain the differences in interpersonal interaction.","[Zhang, Xing; Xu, Wenjian; Ma, Yuanxiao; Chen, Xu] Southwest Univ, Fac Psychol, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xing; Xu, Wenjian; Ma, Yuanxiao; Chen, Xu] Southwest Univ, Key Lab Cognit & Personal, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Ran, Guangming] China West Normal Univ, Inst Educ, Nanchong, Peoples R China","Chen, X (reprint author), Southwest Univ, Fac Psychol, Chongqing, Peoples R China.; Chen, X (reprint author), Southwest Univ, Key Lab Cognit & Personal, Chongqing, Peoples R China.","chenxu@swu.edu.cn","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31771232]","This project was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31771232).","","71","0","0","3","3","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","1664-1078","","","FRONT PSYCHOL","Front.

Recent brain imaging studies focused on structural and functional characteristics of the brain that are correlated with creativity. But whether and how the association between creativity and the brain is moderated by individuals' cultural traits remains unclear. We integrated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and questionnaire measures (Williams creativity aptitude test) of trait creativity and self-construal (e.g., interdependence) in male adults to examine whether trait creativity is associated with neural activities underlying social cognition and whether and how the association is moderated by individuals' self-construals. We found that interdependence moderates the association between trait creativity and neural activities in the left superior temporal sulcus, right anterior insular, right temporal-parietal junction and right precentral gyrus engaged in reflection of one's own social attributes. Interdependence also moderates the association between trait creativity and neural activities in the left superior temporal sulcus and right posterior insular involved in reflection of a friend's social attributes. The link of trait creativity and the functional connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex and postcentral gyri during reflection of a friend's social attributes is also moderated by interdependence. Participants with high and low creativity traits can be dissociated in a three-dimension space defined by integration of interdependence and the brain activity underlying reflection of one's own and the friend's attributes. Our findings suggest that trait creativity is imprinted on the social brain and the link between trait creativity and the neural activities underlying the processing of self and others is moderated by a cultural trait.","[Liu, Yi] Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Psychol, Renmin St 5268, Changchun 130024, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yi] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Psychol & Sociol, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yi; Han, Shihui] Peking Univ, Beijing Key Lab Behav & Mental Hlth, PKU IDG McGovern Inst Brain Res, Sch Psychol & Cognit Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wu, Bing; Wu, Xinhuai] Beijing Mil Gen Hosp, Dept Radiol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Petti, Claudio] Univ Salento, Dept Engn Innovat, Lecce, Italy","Liu, Y (reprint author), Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Psychol, Renmin St 5268, Changchun 130024, Jilin, Peoples R China.; Han, SH (reprint author), Peking Univ, Beijing Key Lab Behav & Mental Hlth, PKU IDG McGovern Inst Brain Res, Sch Psychol & Cognit Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Wu, XG (reprint author), Beijing Mil Gen Hosp, Dept Radiol, Beijing, Peoples R China.","liuyi_psy@163.com; bei925@sina.com; shan@pku.edu.cn","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31470986, 31421003, 31661143039]; European Union [610350]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project 31470986; 31421003; 31661143039) and the European Union under an FP7/2007-2013 Marie Curie International Research Staff Exchange Scheme under REA Grant Agreement N. 610350, Project E.N.T.I.C.E.","","50","2","2","10","15","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","0028-3932","1873-3514","","NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA","Neuropsychologia","MAR","2018","111","","","","","","284","291","","10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2018.02.012","","","","8","Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences; Psychology, Experimental","Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychology","GD6UQ","WOS:000430644300033","29432769","","","","2019-02-21","searchterm","searchterm_records_501-1000.txt"

To identify the underlying mechanism, we compared stress recovery for people reflecting on a stressor while in a positive emotional context with that for people in a neutral context. While blood-oxygen-level dependent data were being collected, participants (N = 43) performed a stressful anagram task, which was followed by a recovery period during which they reflected on the stressor while watching a positive or neutral video. Participants also reported positive and negative emotions throughout the task as well as retrospective thoughts about the task. Although there was no effect of experimental context on emotional recovery, we found that ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activation during the stressor predicted more positive emotions during recovery, which in turn predicted less negative emotions during recovery. In addition, the relationship between vmPFC activation and positive emotions during recovery was mediated by decentering-the meta-cognitive detachment of oneself from one's feelings. In sum, successful recovery from a stressor seems to be due to activation of positive emotion-related regions during the stressor itself as well as to their downstream effects on certain cognitive forms of emotion regulation.","[Yang, Xi; Garcia, Katelyn M.; Waugh, Christian E.] Wake Forest Univ, Dept Psychol, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA; [Jung, Youngkyoo; Whitlow, Christopher T.] Wake Forest Sch Med, Winston Salem, NC USA; [McRae, Kateri] Univ Denver, Dept Psychol, Denver, CO 80208 USA","Yang, X (reprint author), 1227 Univ Oregon, Dept Psychol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.","xiy@uoregon.edu","","","National Institutes of Health [MH106928]","This study was supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (MH106928) to Christian Waugh and Kateri McRae.","","103","1","1","1","2","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

Nevertheless, if a victim perceives the risk of further exploitation by his/her transgressor as non-negligible, the victim may well have difficulty forgiving the transgressor. Therefore, a key ingredient of reconciliation is the transgressor's sincere apology. Theoretical and empirical studies have shown that transgressors can make their apologies credible by incurring a substantial cost. Therefore, we hypothesized that costly apologies, compared to non-costly apologies (i.e., simply saying ""sorry""), would effectively communicate a transgressor's conciliatory intention. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, participants were asked to imagine a friend committing a mild interpersonal transgression (e.g., standing up the participant) and then apologizing in a costly fashion, apologizing in a non-costly fashion, or not apologizing at all. Compared to non-costly apologies and non-apologies, costly apologies (signals of conciliatory intention) more strongly activated the theory-of-mind network (i.e., bilateral temporoparietal junction, precuneus, medial prefrontal cortex). Moreover, we did not observe any significant differences in brain responses to non-costly apologies and non-apology controls. These results underscore the importance of costly signals in human communication and in human peace-making in particular. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Nevertheless, little is known about the specific navigational strategies associated with encoding the position of another person in the wider spatial environment. We asked two groups of participants to learn the location of a target (person or object) during active navigation, while optic flow information, a landmark, or both optic flow information and a landmark were available in a virtual environment. Whereas optic flow information is used for body-based encoding, such as the simulation of motor movements, landmarks are used to form an abstract, disembodied representation of the environment. During testing, we passively moved participants through virtual space, and compared their abilities to correctly decide whether the non-visible target was before or behind them. Using psychometric functions and the Bayes Theorem, we show that both groups assigned similar weights to body-based and environment-based cues in the condition, where both cue types were available. However, the group who was provided with a person as target showed generally reduced position errors compared to the group who was provided with an object as target. We replicated this effect in a second study with novel participants. This indicates a social advantage in spatial encoding, with facilitated processing of both body-based and environment-based cues during spatial navigation when the position of a person is encoded. This may underlie our critical ability to make accurate distance judgments during social interactions, for example, during fight or flight responses.","[Kuehn, Esther; Chen, Xiaoli; Geise, Pia; Oltmer, Jan; Wolbers, Thomas] DZNE, Aging & Cognit Res Grp, D-39120 Magdeburg, Germany; [Kuehn, Esther; Wolbers, Thomas] Ctr Behav Brain Sci Magdeburg, D-39106 Magdeburg, Germany; [Kuehn, Esther] Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Dept Neurol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany","Kuehn, E (reprint author), DZNE, Aging & Cognit Res Grp, D-39120 Magdeburg, Germany.; Kuehn, E (reprint author), Ctr Behav Brain Sci Magdeburg, D-39106 Magdeburg, Germany.; Kuehn, E (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Human Cognit & Brain Sci, Dept Neurol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.","esther.kuehn@dzne.de","","Wolbers, Thomas/0000-0003-2943-8949","Max Planck Society; CBBS-ScienceCampus [Aktenzeichen: SAS-2015_LIN_LWC]; Human Frontiers Science Program [RGP 0062/2014]","Open access funding provided by Max Planck Society.

Following a surge of interest in implicit attitude measures in the 90s, researchers have tried to assess self-esteem implicitly to circumvent the influence of biases inherent in explicit measures. However, the validity of implicit self-esteem measures remains elusive. Critical tests are often inconclusive, as the validity of such measures is examined in the backdrop of imperfect behavioral measures. To overcome this serious limitation, we tested the neural validity of the most widely used implicit self-esteem measure, the implicit association test (IAT). Given the conceptualization of self-esteem as attitude toward the self, and neuroscience findings that the reward-related brain regions represent an individual's attitude or preference for an object when viewing its image, individual differences in implicit self-esteem should be associated with neural signals in the reward-related regions during passive-viewing of self-face (the most obvious representation of the self). Using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) on functional MRI (fMRI) data, we demonstrate that the neural signals in the reward-related regions were robustly associated with implicit (but not explicit) self-esteem, thus providing unique evidence for the neural validity of the self-esteem IAT. In addition, both implicit and explicit self-esteem were related, although differently, to neural signals in regions involved in self-processing. Our finding highlights the utility of neuroscience methods in addressing fundamental psychological questions and providing unique insights into important psychological constructs.","[Izuma, Keise; Kennedy, Kate; Fitzjohn, Alexander] Univ York, Dept Psychol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Sedikides, Constantine] Univ Southampton, Dept Psychol, Southampton, Hants, England; [Shibata, Kazuhisa] Nagoya Univ, Dept Cognit & Psychol Sci, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan","Izuma, K (reprint author), Univ York, Dept Psychol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.","keise.izuma@york.ac.uk","","Sedikides, Contantine/0000-0003-4036-889X","JSPS Kakehnhi [17H04789]","We thank Ellen Kingsley and Olivia Rogerson for their assistance in data collection and the staff of the Neuroimaging Centre for their assistance in conducting the fMRI.

On each trial, participants had to decide whether the taste of a gustatory stimulus matched or did not match the expected taste of the food item depicted in an image. There were four conditions: Negative match (NM; sour gustatory stimulus and image of sour food), negative mismatch (NMM; sour gustatory stimulus and image of sweet food), positive match (PM; sweet gustatory stimulus and image of sweet food), positive mismatch (PMM; sweet gustatory stimulus and image of sour food). Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrasts between the NMM and the NM conditions revealed an increased activity in the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) (BA 6), the lingual gyrus (LG) (BA 18), and the postcentral gyrus. Furthermore, the NMM minus NM BOLD differences observed in the MFG were correlated with the NMM minus NM differences in response time. These activations were specifically associated with conflict control during the aversive gustatory stimulation. BOLD contrasts between the PMM and the PM condition revealed no significant positive activation, which supported the hypothesis that the human brain is especially sensitive to aversive stimuli. Altogether, these results suggest that the MFG is associated with the taste-visual cross-modal conflict control. A possible role of the LG as an information conflict detector at an early perceptual stage is further discussed, along with a possible involvement of the postcentral gyrus in the processing of the taste-visual cross-modal sensory contrast.

In the present fMRI study, we replicated the previously reported observer effect in ethical consumption, in that participants were more likely to purchase social products that are sold to support people in need than non-social products when being observed by others. fMRI data revealed that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) encoded subject-specific value parameters of purchase decisions for social and non-social products, respectively, under social observation. The ACC showed strong functional coupling with the amygdala and the anterior insula when participants in the observation condition were making purchases of social versus non-social products. Finally, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity predicted faster reaction time and increased prosocial behavior during decisions to purchase social versus non-social products, regardless of social observation. The present findings suggest that subregions of the mPFC, namely the dmPFC, ACC, and vmPFC, are hierarchically organized to encode different levels of decision values from the value of context-sensitive reputation to that of internalized prosociality.","[Jung, Daehyun; Lee, Minwoo; Kim, Hackjin] Korea Univ, Lab Social & Decis Neurosci, Seoul, South Korea; [Jung, Daehyun] Korea Univ, Dept Brain & Cognit Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Minwoo; Kim, Hackjin] Korea Univ, Dept Psychol, Seoul, South Korea; [Sul, Sunhae] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Psychol, Busan, South Korea; [Lee, Minwoo] Emory Univ, Dept Anthropol, 201 Dowman Dr, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA","Kim, H (reprint author), Korea Univ, Lab Social & Decis Neurosci, Seoul, South Korea.; Kim, H (reprint author), Korea Univ, Dept Psychol, Seoul, South Korea.","hackjinkim@korea.ac.kr","","Lee, Minwoo/0000-0002-3369-2790; Sul, Sunhae/0000-0001-5286-4343","National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2015S1A3A2046711]","This work was supported by a grant by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2015S1A3A2046711).","","79","1","1","1","7","NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP","LONDON","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","2045-2322","","","SCI REP-UK","Sci Rep","FEB 20","2018","8","","","","","","","","3368","10.1038/s41598-018-21449-z","","","","13","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science & Technology - Other Topics","FW7KA","WOS:000425500300040","29463816","DOAJ Gold, Green Published","","","2019-02-21","searchterm","searchterm_records_501-1000.txt"

It is unclear, however, whether prior knowledge can affect post-encoding brain activity to facilitate memory consolidation. In this fMRI study, we asked participants to associate novel houses with famous/nonfamous faces and investigated how associative-encoding tasks with/without prior knowledge differentially affected post-encoding brain connectivity during rest. Besides memory advantages in the famous condition, we found that post-encoding hippocampal connectivity with the fusiform face area (FFA) and ventral-medial-prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was stronger following encoding of associations with famous than non-famous faces. Importantly, post-encoding functional connectivity between the hippocampus (HPC) and FFA, and between the anterior temporal pole region (aTPL) and posterior perceptual regions (i.e., FFA and the parahippocampal place area), together predicted a large proportion of the variance in subsequent memory performance. This prediction was specific for face-house associative memory, not face/house item memory, and only in the famous condition where prior knowledge was involved. These results support the idea that when prior knowledge is involved, the HPC, vmPFC, and aTPL, which support prior episodic, social-evaluative/schematic, and semantic memories, respectively, continue to interact with each other and posterior perceptual brain regions during the post-encoding rest to facilitate off-line processing of the newly formed memory, and enhance memory consolidation.","[Liu, Zhong-Xu; Grady, Cheryl; Moscovitch, Morris] Univ Toronto, Baycrest Hlth Sci, Rotman Res Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Grady, Cheryl; Moscovitch, Morris] Univ Toronto, Dept Psychol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Grady, Cheryl] Univ Toronto, Dept Psychiat, Toronto, ON, Canada","Liu, ZX (reprint author), Baycrest Hlth Sci, Rotman Res Inst, 3560 Bathurst St, Toronto, ON M6A 2E1, Canada.","zhongxuliu@gmail.com","Hoang, Nick/N-5738-2015","Hoang, Nick/0000-0001-7097-7114","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [RGPIN 8347]; NSERC PDS scholarship","This study was supported by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada RGPIN 8347 to M.

Previous literature concerning social identities generally suggests that people tend to show in-group favoritism toward members who share the same identity. However, how our brains process signals of identity while facing uncertain situations in interpersonal interactions remains largely unclear. To address this issue, we performed an fMRI experiment with 54 healthy adults who belonged to two identity groups of opposing political orientations. The identity information of participants was extracted from a large-scale social survey on the 2012 Taiwan presidential election. Accordingly, participants were categorized as either the Kuomintang (KMT) or the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) supporters. During the experiment, participants played trust games with computer agents with labels of the same or the opposing political identity. Interestingly, our results suggest that the behaviors of the two groups cannot be equally attributed to in-group favoritism. Behaviorally, only the DPP supporter group showed a significant trust preference toward in-group members, which did not hold for the KMT supporter group. Consistently, neurophysiological findings further revealed that only the DPP supporter group showed neuronal responses to both unexpected negative feedback from in-group members in anterior insula, temporoparietal junction, and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, as well as to unexpected rewards from out-group members in caudate. These findings therefore suggest that acquired identities play a more complex role in modulating people's social expectation in interpersonal trust behaviors under identity-relevant contexts.","[Wu, Chien-Te] Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Med, Sch Occupat Therapy, Taipei, Taiwan; [Wu, Chien-Te] Natl Taiwan Univ Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Taipei, Taiwan; [Fan, Yang-Teng; Yang, Tien-Tun; Hsung, Ray-May] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Sociol, Taipei, Taiwan; [Fan, Yang-Teng] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Biol Sci & Technol, Hsinchu, Taiwan; [Du, Ye-Rong; Chen, Shu-Heng] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Du, Ye-Rong] Taiwan Inst Econ Res, Reg Dev Res Ctr, Taipei, Taiwan; [Liu, Ho-Ling] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Imaging Phys, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Yen, Nai-Shing] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Psychol, Taipei, Taiwan; [Yen, Nai-Shing] Natl Chengchi Univ, Res Ctr Mind Brain & Learning, Taipei, Taiwan","Hsung, RM (reprint author), Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Sociol, Taipei, Taiwan.","hsung@nccu.edu.tw","","WU, CHIEN-TE/0000-0001-7349-0731","Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan [MOST 102-2420-H-004-009-MY2, MOST 104-2420-H-004-004-MY3]","This study was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST 102-2420-H-004-009-MY2 and MOST 104-2420-H-004-004-MY3) in Taiwan.","","61","0","0","3","10","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","1662-5161","","","FRONT HUM NEUROSCI","Front.

Lateral PFC areas are particularly susceptible to age-related atrophy, which affects executive function (EF). We used structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to test the hypothesis that older age is associated with greater medial PFC engagement during processing of negative information, and that this engagement is dependent upon the integrity of grey matter structure in lateral PFC as well as EF. Participants (n = 64, 38-79 years) viewed negative and neutral scenes while in the scanner, and completed cognitive tests as part of a larger study. Grey matter probability (GMP) was computed to index grey matter integrity. FMRI data demonstrated less activity in the left ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC) and greater ventromedial PFC (VMPFC) activity with increasing age during negative-picture viewing. Age did not correlate with amygdala responding. GMP in VLPFC and EF were negatively associated with VMPFC activity. We conclude that this change from lateral to medial PFC engagement in response to picture-induced negative affect reflects decreased reliance on executive function-related processes, possibly associated with reduced grey matter in lateral PFC, with advancing age to maintain emotional functioning.","[van Reekum, Carien M.] Univ Reading, Sch Psychol & Clin Language Sci, Ctr Integrat Neurosci & Neurodynam, Reading RG6 6AL, Berks, England; [Schaefer, Stacey M.; Lapate, Regina C.; Norris, Catherine J.; Davidson, Richard J.] Univ Wisconsin, Waisman Brain Imaging Core, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Schaefer, Stacey M.; Lapate, Regina C.; Norris, Catherine J.; Davidson, Richard J.] Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Hlth Minds, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Tun, Patricia A.; Lachman, Margie E.] Brandeis Univ, Dept Psychol, Waltham, MA 02453 USA; [Ryff, Carol A.] Univ Wisconsin, Inst Aging, Madison, WI 53706 USA","van Reekum, CM (reprint author), Univ Reading, Sch Psychol & Clin Language Sci, Whiteknights Campus, Reading RG6 6AL, Berks, England.","c.vanreekum@reading.ac.uk","","","National Institute of Aging [P01-AG20166]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/L02697X/1, BB/J009539/1]","This research was supported by grants from the National Institute of Aging (P01-AG20166) awarded to CAR and RJD, and from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/J009539/1 and BB/L02697X/1) awarded to CvR.","","41","0","0","2","5","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

This has been associated with negative social consequences, as objectified individuals are judged to be less human, competent, and moral. Moreover, behavioral responses toward the person change as a function of the degree of the perceived sexual objectification. In the present study, we investigated how behavioral and neural representations of other social pain are modulated by the degree of sexual objectification of the target. Using a within-subject fMRI design, we found reduced empathic feelings for positive (but not negative) emotions toward sexually objectified women as compared to non-objectified (personalized) women when witnessing their participation to a ball-tossing, game. At the brain level, empathy for social exclusion of personalized women recruited areas coding the affective component of pain (i.e., anterior insula and cingulate cortex), the somatosensory components of pain (i.e., posterior insula and secondary somatosensory cortex) together with the mentalizing network (i.e., middle frontal cortex) to a greater extent than for the sexually objectified women.

Here, we used drift-diffusion models combined with model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging, effective connectivity, and multivariate pattern analysis to characterize the neuro-computational architecture of value-based decisions. We found that 2 key drift-diffusion computations at the selection stage, namely integration and choice readout, engage distinct brain regions, with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex integrating a decision value signal computed in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and the posterior parietal cortex reading out choice outcomes. Our findings suggest that this prefronto-parietal network acts as a hub implementing behavioral selection through a distributed drift-diffusion process.","[Domenech, Philippe; Redoute, Jerome; Dreher, Jean-Claude] CNRS, Inst Sci Cognit Marc Jeannerod, Neuroecon Reward & Decis Making Grp, F-69675 Bron, France; [Domenech, Philippe; Redoute, Jerome; Dreher, Jean-Claude] Univ Lyon 1, Dept Biol Humaine, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Domenech, Philippe] Henri Mondor Hosp, AP HP, DHU Pepsy, Neurosurg Dept, F-94000 Creteil, France; [Redoute, Jerome] CERMEP Imagerie Vivant, F-69675 Bron, France; [Koechlin, Etienne] Ecole Normale Super, INSERM, Lab Neurosci Cognit, F-75005 Paris, France","Domenech, P (reprint author), CNRS, Inst Sci Cognit Marc Jeannerod, Neuroecon Reward & Decis Making Grp, F-69675 Bron, France.; Dreher, JC (reprint author), CNRS, Ctr Neurosci Cognit, Neuroecon Reward & Decis Making Grp, UMR 5229, 67 Bd Pinel, F-69675 Bron, France.","philippe.domenech@inserm.fr; dreher@isc.cnrs.fr","Koechlin, Etienne/E-5061-2016","Koechlin, Etienne/0000-0002-6514-9311; Domenech, philippe/0000-0003-0122-7349","BRAINCHOICE [ANR-14-CE13-0006-01]; ANR-NSF (CRCNS ""SOCIAL_POMDP"") [ANR-16-NEUC-0003-01]; program ""Investissements d'Avenir"" [ANR-11-IDEX-0007]; EURIAS Fellowship Program; LABEX BioPSY [ANR-11-IDEX-0004-02]","This work was funded by the ANR-14-CE13-0006-01 ""BRAINCHOICE"" and ANR-NSF (CRCNS ""SOCIAL_POMDP"" ANR-16-NEUC-0003-01) to J.C.-D.

Neuroimaging studies show that social-based and fairness-related decision-making activates an inconsistent set of areas, which sometimes includes the anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and others lateral prefrontal cortices. Social-based decision-making is complex and variability in findings may be driven by socio-cognitive activities related to social norms. To distinguish among social-cognitive activities related to social norms, we identified 36 eligible articles in the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) literature, which we separate into two categories (a) social norm representation and (b) norm violations. The majority of original articles (>60%) used tasks associated with fairness norms and decision-making, such as ultimatum game, dictator game, or prisoner's dilemma; the rest used tasks associated to violation of moral norms, such as scenarios and sentences of moral depravity ratings. Using quantitative metaanalyses, we report common and distinct brain areas that show concordance as a function of category. Specifically, concordance in ventromedial prefrontal regions is distinct to social norm representation processing, whereas concordance in right insula, dorsolateral prefrontal, and dorsal cingulate cortices is distinct to norm violation processing. We propose a neurocognitive model of social norms for healthy adults, which could help guide future research in social norm compliance and mechanisms of its enforcement.","[Zinchenko, Oksana] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Ctr Cognit & Decis Making, 3 Krivokolenny Pereulok, Moscow 101000, Russia; [Arsalidou, Marie] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Dept Psychol, Moscow, Russia; [Arsalidou, Marie] York Univ, Dept Psychol, Fac Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada","Zinchenko, O (reprint author), Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Ctr Cognit & Decis Making, 3 Krivokolenny Pereulok, Moscow 101000, Russia.","ozinchenko@hse.ru","Zinchenko, Oksana/N-9113-2015","Zinchenko, Oksana/0000-0002-7976-3224; Arsalidou, Marie/0000-0001-9879-3894","Russian Academic Excellence Project [5-100]; Russian Science Foundation [17-18-01047]","The study has been funded by the Russian Academic Excellence Project '5-100' to OZ.

This aspect of social life is captured in the social mindfulness paradigm (SoMi task), in which participants make decisions that either limit or preserve options for their interaction partner's subsequent choice. Here we investigated the neural correlates of spontaneous socially mindful and unmindful behaviours. Functional magnetic resonance data were acquired from 47 healthy adolescents and young adults (age 16-27) as they completed the SoMi task. Being faced with socially relevant choices was associated with activity in the medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, caudate, and insula, which is consistent with prior neuroeconomical research. Importantly, socially mindful choices were associated with activity in the right parietal cortex and the caudate, whereas unmindful choices were associated with activity in the left prefrontal cortex. These neural findings were consistent with the behavioural preference for mindful choices, suggesting that socially mindful decisions are the basic inclination, whereas socially unmindful responses may require greater effort and control. Together, these results begin to uncover the neural correlates of socially mindful and unmindful choices, and illuminate the psychological processes involved in cooperative social behaviour.","[Lemmers-Jansen, Imke L.

These patterns were also suggested by whole brain analyses, with homosexual women showing category-specific activations of greater extents in visual and auditory processing areas.

We report the results of a novel two-person functional MRI study in which trained couple dancers engaged in bimanual contact with an experimenter standing next to the bore of the magnet, and in which the two alternated between being the leader and the follower of joint improvised movements. Leading showed a general pattern of self-orientation, being associated with brain areas involved in motor planning, navigation, sequencing, action monitoring, and error correction. In contrast, following showed a far more sensory, externally-oriented pattern, revealing areas involved in somatosensation, proprioception, motion tracking, social cognition, and outcome monitoring. We also had participants perform a ""mutual"" condition in which the movement patterns were pre-learned and the roles were symmetric, thereby minimizing any tendency toward either leading or following. The mutual condition showed greater activity in brain areas involved in mentalizing and social reward than did leading or following. Finally, the analysis of improvisation revealed the dual importance of motor-planning and working-memory areas.

Whereas the right anterior insula (rAI) were modulated by ingroup bias, in which ingroup member elicited stronger activity than outgroup member did. Furthermore, activity in the ACC was modulated by activity of rAI (i.e., ingroup bias) in the pain condition, while activity in the rAI was modulated by activity of ACC (i.e., racial bias) in the nopain condition.

Empathic neural activity for pain was reduced by alcohol intoxication only in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). More interestingly, we observed that empathic neural activity for pain in the right anterior insula (rAI) was significantly correlated with trait empathy only after alcohol intoxication, along with impaired functional connectivity between the rAI and the fronto-parietal attention network.

Methods: An fMRI-based methodology was employed to examine the brain activation of subjects prescreened for ASMR-receptivity (n=10) as they watched ASMR videos and identified specific moments of relaxation and tingling. Results: Subjects who experienced ASMR showed significant activation in regions associated with both reward (NAcc) and emotional arousal (dACC and Insula/IFG). Brain activation during ASMR showed similarities to patterns previously observed in musical frisson as well as affiliative behaviors. Conclusion: This is the first study to measure the activation of various brain regions during ASMR and these results may help to reveal the mechanistic underpinnings of this sensation.","[Lochte, Bryson C.; Guillory, Sean A.; Kelley, William M.] Dartmouth Coll, Ctr Cognit Neurosci, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Richard, Craig A.

How these individualized patterns may be constrained by environment and genetics is unknown. Here we ask whether the connectotype is familial and heritable. Using a novel approach to estimate familiality via a machine-learning framework, we analyzed resting-state fMRI scans from two well-characterized samples of child and adult siblings. First we show that individual connectotypes were reliably identified even several years after the initial scanning timepoint. Familial relationships between participants, such as siblings versus those who are unrelated, were also accurately characterized. The connectotype demonstrated substantial heritability driven by high-order systems including the fronto-parietal, dorsal attention, ventral attention, cingulo-opercular, and default systems. This work suggests that shared genetics and environment contribute toward producing complex, individualized patterns of distributed brain activity, rather than constraining local aspects of function.

In order to navigate this social world, it is crucial for individuals to learn from and about others. From learning new skills by observing parents perform them tomaking complex collective decisions, understanding the mechanisms underlying social cognitive processes has been of considerable interest to psychologists and neuroscientists. Here, we review studies that have used computational modelling techniques, combined with neuroimaging, to shed light on how people learn and make decisions in social contexts. As opposed to standard social neuroscience methods, the computational approach allows one to directly examine where in the brain particular computations, as estimated by models of behavior, are implemented. Findings suggest that people use several strategies tolearn from others: vicarious reward learning, where one learns from observing the reward outcomes of another agent; action imitation, which relies on encoding a prediction error between the expected and actual actions of the other agent; and social inference, where one learns by inferring the goals and intentions of others. These computations are implemented indistinct neural networks, which may be recruited adaptively depending on task demands, the environment and other social factors.","[Charpentier, Caroline J.; O'Doherty, John P.] CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Charpentier, CJ (reprint author), CALTECH, MC 228-77,1200 E Calif Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.","ccharpen@caltech.edu","","","National Institute of Mental Health [Caltech Conte Center for Social Decision Making]","This work was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health [Caltech Conte Center for Social Decision Making].","","82","0","0","5","5","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1747-0919","1747-0927","","SOC NEUROSCI-UK","Soc.

This report for the first time uses a combination of cognitive and the social neuroscience to put this model to the test.RMT proposes that members of every culture use all four relational models, just in different proportions. It should therefore be possible to study their neural correlates in a mono-cultural sample. In this study, thirty-nine European-American students were imaged in a 3T Siemens Trio with a 24-channel head coil while rating the extent to which each relational model organized relationships with each of thirty-two acquaintances/friend/relatives in a boxcar design. FreeSurfer Functional Analysis Stream (FS-FAST) analyses revealed distinct patterns of activation for each of the relational models.

In the current study, we sought to complement these findings by testing whether inter-individual differences in functional connectivity of humor-related brain regions are modulated by stable personality characteristics during humor processing. Using fMRI techniques, we studied 19 healthy subjects during the processing of standardized humorous and neutral cartoons. In order to isolate the specific effects of humor appreciation, subjective funniness ratings, collected during the scanning procedure, were implemented in the analysis as parametric modulation. Two distinct clusters in the right amygdala and the left insula were identified. Seed-to-voxel connectivity analysis investigating the effects of personality on inter-individual differences in functional connectivity revealed that amygdala and insula connectivity with brain areas previously related to humor comprehension (e.g. middle temporal gyrus) and appreciation (e.g. caudate nucleus) were significantly modulated by personality dimensions. These results underscore the sensitivity of humor processing to moderating influences, such as personality, and call attention to the importance of brain connectivity measures for the investigation of inter-individual differences in the processing of humor.","[Berger, Philipp; Bitsch, Florian; Nagels, Arne; Straube, Benjamin; Falkenberg, Irina] Philipps Univ Marburg, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Rudolf Bultmann Str 8, D-35039 Marburg, Germany","Berger, P (reprint author), Philipps Univ Marburg, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Rudolf Bultmann Str 8, D-35039 Marburg, Germany.","philipp.berger@med.uni-marburg.de","Straube, Benjamin/K-3126-2012","Straube, Benjamin/0000-0002-9837-0944","Else Kroner-Fresenius-Stiftung [2014_A136]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [STR-1146/4-1, STR-1146/8-1, STR-1146/9-1]","This work was supported by the Else Kroner-Fresenius-Stiftung [2014_A136].

Faces of same-sex sibling, best friend, celebrity, and unknown person appear in the middle of the screen while participants perform a task requiring a button click each time a central white dot turns red. Ratings of familiarity (time spent together) and emotionality (feelings toward individual) toward the four individuals are recorded. Local activation within the hypothalamus is assessed via two complementary methods: (1) voxel-based analyses within inclusive mask of the hypothalamus; (2) region-of-interest (ROI) analysis of partial hypothalamic volumes using SON and PVN as center of mass coordinates, with percent signal change extracted and analyzed within these ROIs. Results suggest that the SON responds to all familiar individuals while the PVN has increased response to sibling compared to friend faces and is correlated to familiarity but not emotionality. These findings support differential involvement of local hypothalamic substructures SON and PVN in response to faces of individuals with different social relationships.","[Wolfe, Farah H.; Deruelle, Christine; Chaminade, Thierry] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, UMR7289, Inst Neurosci Timone, Marseille, France","Chaminade, T (reprint author), Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, UMR7289, Inst Neurosci Timone, Marseille, France.","thierry.chaminade@univ-amu.fr","","","","","","31","1","1","2","3","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1747-0919","1747-0927","","SOC NEUROSCI-UK","Soc.

The current study used complementary behavioral and neuroimaging approaches to test the hypothesis that intragroup conflict heightens participants' susceptibility to subsequent false memories. Healthy young adults witnessed and later answered questions about events in which the perpetrator and victim were either 1) identified as in-group members relative to each other and the eyewitness, 2) out-group members relative to the eyewitness, but not each other, or 3) out-group members relative to each other (Experiments 1a and 1b). When perpetrators and victims were in-group members (intragroup conflict), participants showed heightened false memory rates. Moreover, false memories increased upon crime realization. Neuroimaging data analysis revealed that salient (as compared to ambiguous) intragroup conflict elicited heightened activation in neural regions associated with resolving cognitive conflict (anterior cingulate cortex; ACC). Increased functional connectivity between the ACC and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex was associated with subsequent false memories (Experiment 2). Results suggest that the social salience of the intragroup conflict may have been associated with participants' increased susceptibility to false memories.","[Carpenter, Alexis C.] Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, 33 Kirkland St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Krendl, Anne C.] Indiana Univ, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN USA","Carpenter, AC (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, 33 Kirkland St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.","alexiscarpenter@g.harvard.edu","","Carpenter, Alexis/0000-0003-2198-3977","Hutton Honor's College at Indiana University","This work was supported by the Hutton Honor's College at Indiana University.","","60","0","0","8","22","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1747-0919","1747-0927","","SOC NEUROSCI-UK","Soc.

Previous work has studied the perception of combined faces and bodies using behavioural and electrophysiological measurements, but the neural correlates of emotional face-body perception still remain unexplored. Here, we combined happy and fearful faces and bodies to investigate the influence of body expressions on the neural processing of the face, the effect of emotional ambiguity between the two and the role of the amygdala in this process. Our functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses showed that the activity in motor, prefrontal and visual areas increases when facial expressions are presented together with bodies rather than in isolation, consistent with the notion that seeing body expressions triggers both emotional and action-related processes. In contrast, psychophysiological interaction analyses revealed that amygdala modulatory activity increases after the presentation of isolated faces when compared to combined faces and bodies. Furthermore, a facial expression combined with a congruent body enhanced both cortical activity and amygdala functional connectivity when compared to an incongruent face-body compound. Finally, the results showed that emotional body postures influence the processing of facial expressions, especially when the emotion conveyed by the body implies danger.","[Solanas, Marta Poyo; Zhan, Minye; Vaessen, Maarten; Hortensius, Ruud; Engelen, Tahnee; de Gelder, Beatrice] Maastricht Univ, Fac Psychol & Neurosci, Dept Cognit Neurosci, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [de Gelder, Beatrice] UCL, Dept Comp Sci, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Hortensius, Ruud] Bangor Univ, Sch Psychol, Wales Inst Cognit Neurosci, Bangor LL57 2AS, Gwynedd, Wales","de Gelder, B (reprint author), Maastricht Univ, Fac Psychol & Neurosci, Dept Cognit Neurosci, Brain & Emot Lab, Oxfordlaan 55, NL-6229 EV Maastricht, Netherlands.","b.degelder@maastrichtuniversity.nl","","Hortensius, Ruud/0000-0002-5279-6202; Engelen, Tahnee/0000-0001-9285-8968","European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for Research (ERC Grant) [295673]","This work was supported by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for Research 2007-13 (ERC Grant agreement number 295673).","","52","2","2","6","9","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

In recent years, increasing numbers of studies have attempted to bridge these disciplines by looking for genetic factors associated with individual differences in behavior, cognition, and brain structure or function. However, different methodological approaches to guarding against false positives have evolved in the two disciplines. To explore methodological issues affecting neurogenetic studies, we conducted an in-depth analysis of 30 consecutive articles in 12 top neuroscience journals that reported on genetic associations in nonclinical human samples. It was often difficult to estimate effect sizes in neuroimaging paradigms. Where effect sizes could be calculated, the studies reporting the largest effect sizes tended to have two features: (i) they had the smallest samples and were generally underpowered to detect genetic effects, and (ii) they did not fully correct for multiple comparisons. Furthermore, only a minority of studies used statistical methods for multiple comparisons that took into account correlations between phenotypes or genotypes, and only nine studies included a replication sample or explicitly set out to replicate a prior finding. Finally, presentation of methodological information was not standardized and was often distributed across Methods sections and Supplementary Material, making it challenging to assemble basic information from many studies. Space limits imposed by journals could mean that highly complex statistical methods were described in only a superficial fashion. In summary, methods that have become standard in the genetics literaturestringent statistical standards, use of large samples, and replication of findingsare not always adopted when behavioral, cognitive, or neuroimaging phenotypes are used, leading to an increased risk of false-positive findings. Studies need to correct not just for the number of phenotypes collected but also for the number of genotypes examined, genetic models tested, and subsamples investigated. The field would benefit from more widespread use of methods that take into account correlations between the factors corrected for, such as spectral decomposition, or permutation approaches. Replication should become standard practice; this, together with the need for larger sample sizes, will entail greater emphasis on collaboration between research groups. We conclude with some specific suggestions for standardized reporting in this area.","[Grabitz, Clara R.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Button, Katherine S.] Univ Bath, Bath, Avon, England; [Munafo, Marcus R.] Univ Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England; [Newbury, Dianne F.] Oxford Brookes Univ, Oxford, England; [Pernet, Cyril R.] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Thompson, Paul A.; Bishop, Dorothy V.

Individuals who experienced high levels of early life stress showed lower levels of brain activation when processing cues signaling potential loss and increased responsivity when actually experiencing losses. Specifically, those with high childhood stress had reduced activation in the posterior cingulate/precuneus, middle temporal gyrus, and superior occipital cortex during the anticipation of potential rewards; reduced activation in putamen and insula during the anticipation of potential losses; and increased left inferior frontal gyrus activation when experiencing an actual loss. These patterns of brain activity were associated with both laboratory and real-world measures of individuals' risk taking in adulthood.

Recently, some theorists have suggested such decisions actually reflect self-focused concern about causing harm, rather than witnessing others suffering. We examined brain activity while participants witnessed needles pierce another person's hand, versus similar non-painful stimuli. More than a month later, participants completed moral dilemmas where causing harm either did or did not maximize outcomes. We employed process dissociation to independently assess harm-rejection (deontological) and outcome-maximization (utilitarian) response tendencies. Activity in the posterior inferior frontal cortex (pIFC) while participants witnessed others in pain predicted deontological, but not utilitarian, response tendencies. Previous brain stimulation studies have shown that the pIFC seems crucial for sensorimotor representations of observed harm. Hence, these findings suggest that deontological response tendencies reflect genuine other-oriented concern grounded in sensorimotor representations of harm.","[Christov-Moore, Leonardo; Iacoboni, Marco] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Brain Res Inst, Ahmanson Lovelace Brain Mapping Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Christov-Moore, Leonardo; Iacoboni, Marco] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Brain Res Inst, Semel Inst Neurosci & Human Behav,Dept Psychiat &, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Christov-Moore, Leonardo] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Edie & Lew Wasserman Ctr, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Conway, Paul] Florida State Univ, Psychol Dept, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Conway, Paul] Univ Cologne, Social Cognit Ctr Cologne, Dept Psychol, Cologne, Germany","Iacoboni, M (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Brain Res Inst, Ahmanson Lovelace Brain Mapping Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.; Iacoboni, M (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Brain Res Inst, Semel Inst Neurosci & Human Behav,Dept Psychiat &, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.","iacoboni@ucla.edu","","","German Research Foundation (DFG) via Thomas Mussweiler's Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Award [MU 1500/5-1]; National Institute of Mental Health [R21 MH097178]; National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship Grant [DGE-1144087]","The authors acknowledge funding from the German Research Foundation (DFG) via Thomas Mussweiler's Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Award (MU 1500/5-1), the National Institute of Mental Health under Grant R21 MH097178 to MI, and a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship Grant (DGE-1144087) to LC-M.","","41","4","4","2","6","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","","1662-5145","","FRONT INTEGR NEUROSC","Front.

Previous neuroimaging studies have shown that inequitable decisions are related to brain regions that associated with negative emotion and signaling conflict. In the highly complex human social environment, our opinions and behaviors can be affected by social information. In current study, we used a modified dictator game to investigate the effect of social influence on making an equitable decision. We found that the choices of participants in present task was influenced by the choices of peers. However, participants' decisions were influenced by equitable rather than inequitable group choices. fMRI results showed that brain regions that related to norm violation and social conflict were related to the inequitable social influence. The neural responses in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, rostral cingulate zone, and insula predicted subsequent conforming behavior in individuals. Additionally, psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed that the interconnectivity between the dorsal striatum and insula was elevated in advantageous inequity influence versus no-social influence conditions. We found decreased functional connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex and insula, supplementary motor area, posterior cingulate gyrus and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in the disadvantageous inequity influence versus no-social influence conditions. This suggests that a disadvantageous inequity influence may decrease the functional connectivity among brain regions that are related to reward processes. Thus, the neural mechanisms underlying social influence in an equitable decision may be similar to those implicated in social norms and reward processing.","[Wei, Zhenyu] Southwest Univ, Ctr Studies Educ & Psychol Ethn Minor Southwest C, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Wei, Zhenyu; Zhao, Zhiying] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Key Lab NeuroInformat, Minist Educ, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Yong] Southwest Univ, Fac Psychol, Key Lab Cognit & Personal, Minist Educ, Chongqing, Peoples R China","Zheng, Y (reprint author), Southwest Univ, Fac Psychol, Key Lab Cognit & Personal, Minist Educ, Chongqing, Peoples R China.","zhengy@swu.edu.cn","","","MOE Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities, China [15JJDZONGHE022]","This work is supported by the MOE Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities, China (#15JJDZONGHE022).","","76","1","1","1","9","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","PO BOX 110, EPFL INNOVATION PARK, BUILDING I, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND","1664-1078","","","FRONT PSYCHOL","Front.

Voxels across an anterior-posterior axis in ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( vmPFC) distinguished ( i) self-others and ( ii) high-low reward, but cross-generalization between these dimensions decreased from anterior to posterior vmPFC. The vmPFC is characterized by a shift from a common currency for value to independent, distributed representations of self and reward across an anterior-posterior axis. This shift reflected changes in functional connectivity between the posterior part of the vmPFC and the frontal pole when processing self- associated stimuli, and the middle frontal gyrus when processing stimuli associated with high reward. The changes in functional connectivity were correlated with behavioral biases, respectively, to the self and reward.

Using multi-voxel pattern approach, we compared neural pattern similarity for the self and family conditions and found that mothers showed greater perceptual similarity between self and child in the fusiform face area ( FFA), representing high self-child overlap, whereas adolescents showed significantly less self-mother overlap. Adolescents' pattern similarity was dependent upon family relationship quality, such that they showed greater self-mother overlap with higher relationship quality, whereas mothers' pattern similarity was independent of relationship quality. Furthermore, adolescents' perceptual similarity in the FFA was associated with increased social brain activation ( e.g. temporal parietal junction). Mediation analyses indicated that high relationship quality was associated with greater social brain activation, which was mediated by greater self-mother overlap in the FFA. Our findings suggest that adolescents show more distinct neural patterns in perceiving their own vs their mother's distress, and such distinction is sensitive to mother-child relationship quality.

Behavioral studies with adults indicate that math anxiety ( feelings of tension or apprehension about math) is associated with poor performance on cognitively demanding math problems. However, it remains unclear whether there are fundamental differences in how high and low math anxious individuals approach overlearned simple arithmetic problems that are less reliant on cognitive control. The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the neural correlates of simple arithmetic performance across high and low math anxious individuals. We implemented a partial least squares analysis, a data-driven, multivariate analysis method to measure distributed patterns of whole-brain activity associated with performance. Despite overall high simple arithmetic performance across high and low math anxious individuals, performance was differentially dependent on the fronto-parietal attentional network as a function of math anxiety. Specifically, low-compared to high-math anxious individuals perform better when they activate this network less-a potential indication of more automatic problem-solving.

Since our social environment is changing constantly, our internal models of it also need to change. In humans, there is mounting evidence that neural structures such as the insula and the ventral striatum are involved in detecting norm violation and updating internal models. However, because of methodological challenges, little is known about the possible involvement of midbrain structures in detecting norm violation and updating internal models of our norms. Here, we used high-resolution cardiac-gated functional magnetic resonance imaging and a norm adaptation paradigm in healthy adults to investigate the role of the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area ( SN/VTA) complex in tracking signals related to norm violation that can be used to update internal norms. We show that the SN/VTA codes for the norm's variance prediction error ( PE) and norm PE with spatially distinct regions coding for negative and positive norm PE.

The ability to represent recursive structures has been hypothesized to increase the efficiency of hierarchical processing. Theoretical work together with recent empirical findings suggests that the ability to represent the self-similar structure of hierarchical recursive stimuli may be supported by internal neural representations that compress raw external information and increase efficiency. In order to explicitly test whether the representation of recursive hierarchies depends on internalized rules we compared the processing of visual hierarchies represented either as recursive or non-recursive, using task-free resting-state fMRI data. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between task-evoked functional networks induced ""by cognitive representations with the corresponding resting-state architecture. We observed increased connectivity within Default Mode Network (DMN) related brain areas during the representation of recursion, while non-recursive representations yielded increased connectivity within the Fronto-Parietal Control-Network. Our results suggest that human hierarchical information processing using recursion is supported by the DMN. In particular, the representation of recursion seems to constitute an internally-biased mode of information-processing that is mediated by both the core and dorsal-medial subsystems of the DMN. Compressed internal rule representations mediated by the DMN may help humans to represent and process hierarchical structures in complex environments by considerably reducing information processing load.

Multivariate analyses of functional MRI data demonstrated that, while food value is represented in patterns of neural activity in both medial and lateral parts of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), only the lateral OFC represents the elemental nutritive attributes. Effective connectivity analyses further indicate that information about the nutritive attributes represented in the lateral OFC is integrated within the medial OFC to compute an overall value.

This experiment examines the neural underpinnings of such evaluations using functional MRI (fMRI). During fMRI, participants completed an experimental task where they evaluated policy positions attributed to hypothetical political candidates. Each block of trials focused on one candidate (Democrat or Republican), but all participants saw two candidates from each party in a randomized order. On each trial, participants received information about whether the candidate supported or opposed a specific policy issue. These issue positions varied in terms of congruence between issue position and candidate party affiliation. We modeled neural activity as a function of incongruence and whether participants were viewing ingroup or outgroup party candidates. Results suggest that neural activity in brain regions previously implicated in both evaluative processing and work on ideological differences (insula and anterior cingulate cortex) differed as a function of the interaction between incongruence, candidate type (ingroup versus outgroup), and political ideology. More liberal participants showed greater activation to incongruent versus congruent trials in insula and ACC, primarily when viewing ingroup candidates. Implications for the study of democratic representation and linkages between citizens' calls for social change and policy implementation are discussed.","[Haas, Ingrid Johnsen] Univ Nebraska, Dept Polit Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Haas, Ingrid Johnsen] Univ Nebraska, Ctr Brain Biol & Behav, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Baker, Melissa N.] Univ Calif Merced, Dept Polit Sci, Merced, CA USA; [Gonzalez, Frank J.] Univ Arizona, Sch Govt & Publ Policy, Tucson, AZ USA","Haas, IJ (reprint author), Univ Nebraska, Dept Polit Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.; Haas, IJ (reprint author), Univ Nebraska, Ctr Brain Biol & Behav, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.","ihaas2@unl.edu","","","University of Nebraska-Lincoln Office for Research and Economic Development, Center for Brain, Biology, and Behavior; College of Arts and Sciences; Department of Political Science","This work was supported by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Office for Research and Economic Development, Center for Brain, Biology, and Behavior, College of Arts and Sciences, and Department of Political Science.","","77","0","0","1","4","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0885-7466","1573-6725","","SOC JUSTICE RES","Soc.

While neuroscience research has shown that distributed brain circuits are associated with seeing in-group and out-group members as ""us"" and ""them"", it is less clear how these networks exchange signals. This fMRI study uses functional connectivity analyses to investigate the contribution of functional integration to group bias modulation of person perception. Participants were assigned to an arbitrary group and during scanning they observed bodies of in-group or out-group members that cued the recall of positive or negative social knowledge. The results showed that functional coupling between perceptual and cognitive neural networks is tuned to particular combinations of group membership and social knowledge valence. Specifically, coupling between body perception and theory-of-mind networks is biased towards seeing a person that had previously been paired with information consistent with group bias (positive for in-group and negative for out-group). This demonstrates how brain regions associated with visual analysis of others and belief reasoning exchange and integrate signals when evaluating in-group and out-group members. The results update models of person perception by showing how and when interplay occurs between perceptual and extended systems when developing a representation of another person.","[Greven, Inez M.; Ramsey, Richard] Bangor Univ, Sch Psychol, Wales Inst Cognit Neurosci, Bangor LL57 2AS, Gwynedd, Wales","Ramsey, R (reprint author), Bangor Univ, Sch Psychol, Bangor LL57 2AS, Gwynedd, Wales.","r.ramsey@bangor.ac.uk","","Ramsey, Richard/0000-0002-0329-2112; Greven, Inez/0000-0003-2354-7677","Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K001884/1]","This work was funded by a grant from the Economic and Social Research Council (Grant no.: ES/K001884/1 to R.R.).","","90","3","3","3","14","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","0028-3932","1873-3514","","NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA","Neuropsychologia","NOV","2017","106","","","","","","225","235","","10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.09.036","","","","11","Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences; Psychology, Experimental","Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychology","FQ1HS","WOS:000418108200024","28970107","","","","2019-02-21","searchterm","searchterm_records_501-1000.txt"

Understanding how these regions interact is a fundamental step to uncover the neural bases of behavior. Most research on the interactions between brain regions has focused on the univariate responses in the regions. However, fine grained patterns of response encode important information, as shown by multivariate pattern analysis. In the present article, we introduce and apply multivariate pattern dependence (MVPD): a technique to study the statistical dependence between brain regions in humans in terms of the multivariate relations between their patterns of responses. MVPD characterizes the responses in each brain region as trajectories in region-specific multidimensional spaces, and models the multivariate relationship between these trajectories. We applied MVPD to the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and to the fusiform face area (FFA), using a searchlight approach to reveal interactions between these seed regions and the rest of the brain. Across two different experiments, MVPD identified significant statistical dependence not detected by standard functional connectivity. Additionally, MVPD outperformed univariate connectivity in its ability to explain independent variance in the responses of individual voxels. In the end, MVPD uncovered different connectivity profiles associated with different representational subspaces of FFA: the first principal component of FFA shows differential connectivity with occipital and parietal regions implicated in the processing of low-level properties of faces, while the second and third components show differential connectivity with anterior temporal regions implicated in the processing of invariant representations of face identity.","[Anzellotti, Stefano; Caramazza, Alfonso; Saxe, Rebecca] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, E25-618, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Caramazza, Alfonso] Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, 33 Kirkland St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Anzellotti, S (reprint author), MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, E25-618, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.","anzellot@mit.edu","","/0000-0002-8964-6988","University of Trento Center for Mind/Brain Science (CIMeC); NIH [1R01 MH096914-01A1]; Simons Foundation postdoctoral fellowship for the Social Brain","Data acquisition was funded by the University of Trento Center for Mind/Brain Science (CIMeC): http://www.cimec.unitn.it/en.

Neural systems active when adults empathize include regions underlying perspective taking (e.g. medial prefrontal cortex; MPFC) and experience sharing (e.g. inferior parietal lobule; IPL). It is unknown whether adolescents utilize networks implicated in both experience sharing and perspective taking when accurately empathizing. This question is critical given the importance of accurately understanding others' emotions for developing and maintaining adaptive peer relationships during adolescence. We extend the literature on empathy in adolescence by determining the neural basis of empathic accuracy, a behavioral assay of empathy that does not bias participants toward the exclusive use of perspective taking or experience sharing. Participants (N = 155, aged 11.1-15.5 years) watched videos of 'targets' describing emotional events and continuously rated the targets' emotions during functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning. Empathic accuracy related to activation in regions underlying perspective taking (MPFC, temporoparietal junction and superior temporal sulcus), while activation in regions underlying experience sharing (IPL, anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula) related to lower empathic accuracy. These results provide novel insight into the neural basis of empathic accuracy in adolescence and suggest that perspective taking processes may be effective for increasing empathy.","[Kral, Tammi R.

Standard analyses for fMRI data typically use general linear models (GLM), which require a priori models of task effects on neural processes. These may inadequately model non-stimulus-locked or temporally overlapping cognitive processes, as mentalizing about other agents. We used the data-driven approach of independent component analysis (ICA) to investigate neural processes involved in a competitive interaction. Participants were confronted with an angry-looking opponent while having to anticipate the trial outcome and the opponent's behaviour. We show that several spatially distinctive neural networks with associated temporal dynamics were modulated by the opponent's facial expression. These results dovetail and extend the main effects observed in the GLM analysis of the same data. Additionally, the ICA approach identified effects of the experimental condition on neural systems during inter-trial intervals. We demonstrate that cognitive processes during aggressive interactions are poorly modelled by simple stimulus onset/duration variables and instead have more complex temporal dynamics. This highlights the utility of using data-driven analyses to elucidate the distinct cognitive processes recruited during complex social paradigms.","[Beyer, Frederike; Kramer, Ulrike M.] Univ Lubeck, Dept Neurol, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany; [Beyer, Frederike; Kramer, Ulrike M.] Univ Lubeck, Inst Psychol 2, D-23538 Lubeck, Germany; [Beyer, Frederike] UCL, Inst Cognit Neurosci, Alexandra House,17 Queen Sq, London WC1N 3AR, England; [Beckmann, Christian F.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Cognit Neurosci, Med Ctr, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Beckmann, Christian F.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Donders Inst Brain Cognit & Behav, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Beckmann, Christian F.] Univ Oxford, John Radcliffe Hosp, Oxford Ctr Funct MRI Brain, Nuffield Dept Clin Neurosci, Oxford OX3 9DU, England","Beyer, F (reprint author), UCL, Inst Cognit Neurosci, Alexandra House,17 Queen Sq, London WC1N 3AR, England.","f.beyer@ucl.ac.uk","Beckmann, Christian/E-6374-2012","Kramer, Ulrike M./0000-0002-3841-1812; Beckmann, Christian F./0000-0002-3373-3193","German section of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology; German Research Foundation [KR3691/5-1]; University of Lubeck; German Research Foundation DFG [BE 5779/1-1]; Wellcome Trust UK [098369/Z/12/Z]; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO-Vidi) [864-12-003]","This study was supported by the German section of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology, the German Research Foundation (KR3691/5-1) and through intramural funding by the University of Lubeck.

Previous fMRI research has suggested that a network of brain regions, including bilateral temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), superior temporal sulcus (STS), and medial prefrontal-cortex (MPFC), are reliably recruited for mental state reasoning. Here, in two fMRI experiments, we investigate the representational content of these regions. Building on existing computational and neural evidence, we hypothesized that social brain regions contain at least two functionally and spatially distinct components: one that represents information related to others' motivations and values, and another that represents information about others' beliefs and knowledge. Using multi-voxel pattern analysis, we find evidence that motivational versus epistemic features are independently represented by theory of mind (ToM) regions: RTPJ contains information about the justification of the belief, bilateral TPJ represents the modality of the source of knowledge, and VMPFC represents the valence of the resulting emotion. These representations are found only in regions implicated in social cognition and predict behavioral responses at the level of single items. We argue that cortical regions implicated in mental state inference contain complementary, but distinct, representations of epistemic and motivational features of others' beliefs, and that, mirroring the processes observed in sensory systems, social stimuli are represented in distinct and distributed formats across the human brain.","[Koster-Hale, Jorie; Richardson, Hilary; Saxe, Rebecca] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, E25-618, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Velez, Natalia; Asaba, Mika] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Young, Liane] Boston Coll, Dept Psychol, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA","Richardson, H (reprint author), 43 Vassar St,46-4021, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.","hlrich@mit.edu","","","NSF Graduate Research Fellowships [0645960, 1122374]; NSF CAREER award [095518]; National Institutes of Health [1R01 MH096914-01A1]; Packard Foundation [2008-333024]","We thank the Athinoula A.

In this study, we acquired resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) data from 10 Cantonese (L1)-Mandarin (L2) early bilinguals (acquired L2: 3 years old) and 11 late bilinguals (acquired L2: 6 years old), and analyzed their topological properties of language networks after controlling the language daily exposure and usage as well as PL in LI and L2. We found that early bilinguals had significantly a higher clustering coefficient, global and local efficiency, but significantly lower characteristic path length compared to late bilinguals. Modular analysis indicated that compared to late bilinguals, early bilinguals showed significantly stronger intra-modular functional connectivity in the semantic and phonetic modules, stronger inter-modular functional connectivity between the semantic and phonetic modules as well as between the phonetic and syntactic modules. Differences in global and local parameters may reflect different patterns of neuroplasticity respectively for early and late bilinguals. These results suggested that different L2 experience influences topological properties of language network, even if late bilinguals achieve high PL-L2. Our findings may provide a new perspective of neural mechanisms related to early and late bilinguals. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

To address this issue, we examined the neural signatures underlying the context- and person-dependent altruistic punishment, conjoining event-related fMRI with both task-based and resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). Acting as an impartial third party, participants decided how to punish norm violators either alone or in the presence of putative others. We found that the presence of others decreased altruistic punishment due to diffusion of responsibility. Those behavioral effects paralleled altered neural responses in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and putamen. Further, we identified modulation of responsibility diffusion on task-based functional connectivity of dACC with the brain regions implicated in reward processing (i.e., posterior cingulate cortex and amygdala/orbital frontal cortex). Finally, the RSFC results revealed that (i) increased intrinsic connectivity strengths of the putamen with temporoparietal junction and dorsolateral PFC were associated with attenuated responsibility diffusion in altruistic punishment and (ii) increased putamen-dorsomedial PFC connectivity strengths were associated with reduced responsibility diffusion in self-reported responsibility. Taken together, our findings elucidate the context- and person-dependent altruistic behaviors as well as associated neural substrates and thus provide a potential neurocognitive mechanism of heterogeneous human altruistic behaviors.

Recently, some studies have explored the association between scale-free dynamic properties of resting-state brain activation and individual personality traits. However, little is known about whether the scale-free dynamics of resting state function networks is associated with delay discounting. To address this question, we calculated the Hurst exponent which quantifies long-term memory of the time series in resting-state networks (RSNs) identified via independent component analysis (ICA) and examined what relationship between delay discounting and the Hurst exponent of RSNs is. ICA results showed that entire nine RSNs were successfully recognized and extracted from independent components. After controlling some covariates, including gender, age, education, personality and trait anxiety, partial correlation analysis revealed that the Hurst exponent in default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN) was positively correlated with the delay discounting rates. No significant correlation between delay discounting and mean Hurst exponent of the whole brain was found. Thus, our results suggest the individual delay discounting is associated with the dynamics of inner-network interactions in the DMN and SN, and highlight the crucial role of scale-free dynamic properties of function networks on intertemporal choice.

We have shown that this population of responders further fractionates into two distinct subsets (Sensory/localized and Affective/General), which presents an important opportunity to investigate the neural underpinnings of individual differences in empathic responses. Our study uses fMRI to determine how regions involved in the perception of pain interact with regions implicated in empathic regulation in these two groups, relative to controls. When observing pain in others (minor injuries to the hands and feet), the two responder groups show activation in both the sensory/discriminative and affective/motivational components of the pain matrix. The control group only showed activation in the latter. The two responder groups showed clear differences in functional connectivity. Notably, Sensory/Localized responders manifest significant coupling between the right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ) and bilateral anterior insula. We conclude that conscious experiences of vicarious pain is supported by specific patterns of functional connectivity between pain-related and regulatory regions, and not merely increased activity within the pain matrix itself.","[Grice-Jackson, Thomas; Ward, Jamie] Univ Sussex, Sch Psychol, Falmer, England; [Grice-Jackson, Thomas; Critchley, Hugo D.; Ward, Jamie] Univ Sussex, Sackler Ctr Consciousness Sci, Falmer, England; [Critchley, Hugo D.] Univ Sussex, Brighton & Sussex Med Sch, Falmer, England; [Banissy, Michael J.] Univ London, Dept Psychol, Goldsmiths Coll, London, England","Ward, J (reprint author), Univ Sussex, Sch Psychol, Falmer, England.; Ward, J (reprint author), Univ Sussex, Sackler Ctr Consciousness Sci, Falmer, England.","jamiew@sussex.ac.uk","Ward, Jamie/F-3609-2011","Ward, Jamie/0000-0001-7007-1902; critchley, hugo/0000-0002-2445-9284","Sackler Center for Consciousness Science","This research is funded by the Sackler Center for Consciousness Science.","","45","2","2","2","13","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","1662-5161","","","FRONT HUM NEUROSCI","Front.

Activity in this network is language-selective, showing virtually no modulation by nonlinguistic tasks. In addition, language comprehension engages a second network consisting of bilateral frontal, parietal, cingulate, and insular regions. Activity in this ""multiple demand"" (MD) network scales with comprehension difficulty, but also with cognitive effort across a wide range of nonlinguistic tasks in a domain-general fashion. Given the functional dissociation between the language and MD networks, their respective contributions to comprehension are likely distinct, yet such differences remain elusive. Prior neuroimaging studies have suggested that activity in each network covaries with some linguistic features that, behaviorally, influence on-line processing and comprehension. This sensitivity of the language and MD networks to local input characteristics has often been interpreted, implicitly or explicitly, as evidence that both networks track linguistic input closely, and in a manner consistent across individuals. Here, weused fMRI to directly test this assumption by comparing the BOLD signal time courses in each network across different people (n = 45, men and women) listening to the same story. Language network activity showed fewer individual differences, indicative of closer input tracking, whereas MD network activity was more idiosyncratic and, moreover, showed lower reliability within an individual across repetitions of a story. These findings constrain cognitive models of language comprehension by suggesting a novel distinction between the processes implemented in the language and MD networks.","[Blank, Idan A.] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Fedorenko, Evelina] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Charlestown, MA 02129 USA; [Fedorenko, Evelina] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Psychiat, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Blank, IA (reprint author), 43 Vassar St,Room 46-3037c, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.","iblank@mit.edu","","Blank, Idan/0000-0001-7057-8391","NICHD [K99/R00, HD 057522]; Simons Foundation; Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), via Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) [FA8650-14-C-7358]","This work was supported by a K99/R00 award HD 057522 from NICHD and a grant from the Simons Foundation to the Simons Center for the Social Brain at MIT to E.F., and partially supported by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), via Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), under contract FA8650-14-C-7358.

However, the contributions of genetic variability in this system to individuals' cognitive control abilities are poorly understood and the brain processes that mediate such genetic contributions remain largely unidentified. In this first large-scale neuroimaging genetics study of the human nicotinic receptor system (two cohorts, males and females, fMRI total N = 1586, behavioral total N = 3650), we investigated a common polymorphism of the high-affinity nicotinic receptor alpha 4 beta 2 (rs1044396 on the CHRNA4 gene) previously implicated in behavioral and nicotine-related studies (albeit with inconsistent major/minor allele impacts). Based on our prior neuroimaging findings, we expected this polymorphism to affect neural activity in the cingulo-opercular (CO) network involved in core cognitive control processes including maintenance of alertness. Consistent across the cohorts, all cortical areas of the CO network showed higher activity in heterozygotes compared with both types of homozygotes during cognitive engagement. This inverted U-shaped relation reflects an overdominant effect; that is, allelic interaction (cumulative evidence p = 1.33 * 10(-5)). Furthermore, heterozygotes performed more accurately in behavioral tasks that primarily depend on sustained alertness. No effects were observed for haplotypes of the surrounding CHRNA4 region, supporting a true overdominant effect at rs1044396. As a possible mechanism, we observed that this polymorphism is an expression quantitative trait locus modulating CHRNA4 expression levels. This is the first report of overdominance in the nicotinic system.

Whereas individualistic cultural groups emphasize an independent self, reflected in processing biases towards centralized salient objects, collectivistic cultures are oriented towards an interdependent self, attending to contextual associations between visual cues. It is unknown how these perceptual biases may affect brain activity in response to negative social cues. Moreover, while some studies have shown that individual differences in self-construal moderate cultural group comparisons, few have examined self-construal differences separate to culture. To investigate these issues, a final sample of a group of healthy participants high in trait levels of collectivistic self-construal (n = 16) and individualistic self-construal (n = 19), regardless of cultural background, completed a negative social cue evaluation task designed to engage face/object vs context-specific neural processes whilst undergoing fMRI scanning. Between-group analyses revealed that the collectivistic group exclusively engaged the parahippocampal gyrus (parahippocampal place area) -a region critical to contextual integration -during negative face processing - suggesting compensatory activations when contextual information was missing. The collectivist group also displayed enhanced negative context dependent brain activity involving the left superior occipital gyrus/cuneus and right anterior insula. By contrast, the individualistic group did not engage object or localized face processing regions as predicted, but rather demonstrated heightened appraisal and self-referential activations in medial prefrontal and temporoparietal regions to negative contexts - again suggesting compensatory processes when focal cues were absent. While individualists also appeared more sensitive to negative faces in the scenes, activating the right middle cingulate gyrus, dorsal prefrontal and parietal activations, this activity was observed relative to the scrambled baseline, and given that prefrontal and occipital regions were also engaged to neutral stimuli, may suggest an individualistic pattern to processing all social cues more generally. These findings suggest that individual differences in self-construal may be an important organizing framework facilitating perceptual processes to emotionally salient social cues, beyond the boundary of cultural group comparisons.","[Liddell, Belinda J.; Whitford, Thomas J.; Battaglini, Eva; Bryant, Richard A.] UNSW Sydney, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Felmingham, Kim L.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Psychol Sci, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Das, Pritha; Malhi, Gin S.] Univ Sydney, Royal North Shore Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Sydney Med Sch Northern, Level 3,Main Bldg, St Leonards, NSW 2065, Australia","Liddell, BJ (reprint author), UNSW Sydney, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.","b.liddell@unsw.edu.au","","Liddell, Belinda/0000-0002-8036-5864","Australian Research Council [LP120200284]","This study was supported by funding from the Australian Research Council (LP120200284).

Past work has identified brain regions that represent morally relevant features and distinguish moral domains, but has not yet advanced a broader account of where and on what basis neural representations of moral violations are organized. With searchlight representational similarity analysis, we investigate where category membership drives similarity in neural patterns during moral judgment of violations from two key moral domains: Harm and Purity. Representations converge across domains in a network of regions resembling the mentalizing network. However, Harm and Purity violation representations respectively converge in different regions: precuneus (PC) and left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG). Examining substructure within moral domains, Harm violations converge in PC regardless of subdomain (physical harms, psychological harms), while Purity subdomains (pathogen-related violations, sex-related violations) converge in distinct sets of regions mirroring a dissociation observed in principal-component analysis of behavioral data. Further, we find initial evidence for representation of morally relevant features within these two domain-encoding regions. The present analyses offer a case study for understanding how organization within the complex conceptual space of moral violations is reflected in the organization of neural patterns across the cortex.","[Wasserman, E.

Previously, we demonstrated that monetary reward and the social reward of good reputation activated the same striatal regions including the caudate nucleus and putamen. However, it remains unclear whether overlapping activations reflect activities of identical neuronal populations or two overlapping but functionally independent neuronal populations. Here, we re-analyzed the original data and addressed this question using multivariate-pattern-analysis and found evidence that in the left caudate nucleus and bilateral nucleus accumbens, social vs monetary reward were represented similarly. The findings suggest that social and monetary rewards are processed by the same population of neurons within these regions of the striatum. Additional findings demonstrated similar neural patterns when participants experience high social reward compared to viewing others receiving low social reward (potentially inducing schadenfreude). This is possibly an early indication that the same population of neurons may be responsible for processing two different types of social reward (good reputation and schadenfreude). These findings provide a supplementary perspective to previous research, helping to further elucidate the mechanisms behind social vs non-social reward processing.","[Wake, Stephanie J.; Izuma, Keise] Univ York, Dept Psychol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England","Izuma, K (reprint author), Univ York, Dept Psychol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.","keise.izuma@york.ac.uk","","","","","","33","7","7","3","11","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1749-5016","1749-5024","","SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR","Soc.

Here, we investigated variations in error related activity depending on two sub-traits of perfectionism, Personal Standard Perfectionism (PSP) and Evaluative Concern Perfectionism (ECP) in a large scale functional magnetic resonance imaging study (N = 75) using a digit-flanker task. Participants with higher PSP scores showed both more post-error slowing and more neural activity in the medial-frontal gyrus including anterior cingulate cortex after errors. Interestingly, high-EC perfectionists with low PSP showed no post-error slowing and the highest activity in the middle frontal gyrus, whereas high-EC perfectionists with high PSP showed the lowest activity in this brain area and more post-error slowing. Our findings are in line with the hypothesis that perfectionists with high concerns but low standards avoid performance monitoring to avoid the worry-inducing nature of detecting personal failure and the anticipation of poor evaluation by others. However, the stronger goal-oriented performance motivation of perfectionists with high concerns and high standards may have led to less avoidance of error processing and a more intense involvement with the imperfect behaviour, which is essential for improving future performance.","[Barke, Antonia] Philipps Univers Marburg, Dept Psychol, Div Clin Psychol & Psychotherapy, D-35032 Marburg, Germany; [Barke, Antonia] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Inst Psychol, Dept Clin Psychol & Psychotherapy, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Bode, Stefan; Van Heer, Christina] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Psychol Sci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Dechent, Peter; Schmidt-Samoa, Carsten] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Univ Med Ctr, Inst Cognit Neurol, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Stahl, Jutta] Univ Cologne, Dept Psychol, Pohligstr 1, D-50969 Cologne, Germany","Stahl, J (reprint author), Univ Cologne, Dept Psychol, Pohligstr 1, D-50969 Cologne, Germany.","jutta.stahl@uni-koeln.de","Barke, Antonia/D-9286-2011","Barke, Antonia/0000-0002-6863-3213; Stahl, Jutta/0000-0002-3252-180X; Bode, Stefan/0000-0002-0258-7795","German Research Foundation [STA 1035/3-1]; Australian Research Council [DP160103353]; ethic committee at the University of Gottingen [0082011]","This research was funded by grants of the German Research Foundation (STA 1035/3-1) to JS and an Australian Research Council Discovery Project Grant (DP160103353) to SB.

Neuroimaging studies have shown that, when participants believe they are interacting via a virtual interface with another human agent, they show different patterns of brain activity compared to when they know that their virtual partner is computer-controlled. The suggestion is that users adopt an ""intentional stance'' by attributing mental states to their virtual partner. However, it remains unclear how beliefs in the agency of a virtual partner influence participants' behaviour and subjective experience of the interaction. We investigated this issue in the context of a cooperative ""joint attention'' game in which participants interacted via an eye tracker with a virtual onscreen partner, directing each other's eye gaze to different screen locations. Half of the participants were correctly informed that their partner was controlled by a computer algorithm (""Computer'' condition). The other half were misled into believing that the virtual character was controlled by a second participant in another room (""Human'' condition). Those in the ""Human'' condition were slower to make eye contact with their partner and more likely to try and guide their partner before they had established mutual eye contact than participants in the ""Computer'' condition. They also responded more rapidly when their partner was guiding them, although the same effect was also found for a control condition in which they responded to an arrow cue. Results confirm the influence of human agency beliefs on behaviour in this virtual social interaction context. They further suggest that researchers and developers attempting to simulate social interactions should consider the impact of agency beliefs on user experience in other social contexts, and their effect on the achievement of the application's goals.","[Caruana, Nathan] Macquarie Univ, Dept Cognit Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Caruana, Nathan] Percept Act Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Caruana, Nathan; Brock, Jon] Ctr Atyp Neurodev, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Caruana, Nathan; Brock, Jon] ARC Ctr Excellence Cognit & its Disorders, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Spirou, Dean; Brock, Jon] Macquarie Univ, Dept Psychol, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Caruana, N (reprint author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Cognit Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Caruana, N (reprint author), Percept Act Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Caruana, N (reprint author), Ctr Atyp Neurodev, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Caruana, N (reprint author), ARC Ctr Excellence Cognit & its Disorders, Sydney, NSW, Australia.","nathan.caruana@mq.edu.au","","Caruana, Nathan/0000-0002-9676-814X; Brock, Jon/0000-0002-9655-3667","Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Cognition and its Disorders [CE110001021]","This work was supported by the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Cognition and its Disorders [CE110001021].

Recent studies suggest an involvement of these afferents in the modulation of pain in healthy volunteers. Small fiber neuropathy (SFN) is associated with a damage of C-fibers. Therefore, an impairment of C-LTMRs can be assumed. We aimed to elaborate a possible role of CT-afferents in pain modulation by investigating healthy volunteers and SFN-patients. Methods: Experiment I: 20 SFN-patients (12 women, median age 52.0 years) and 20 healthy controls (14 women, median age 43.0 years) participated in this prospective fMRI and psychophysical study. Heat-pain (HP), CT-targeted touch (slow brushing) and HP combined with CT-targeted touch were applied in randomized order to the left shank in a block design. The participants rated pain intensity on a visual analogue scale. Experiment II: We investigated a possible impact of pain intensity on CT induced pain modulation (10 healthy participants). The intensity of HP stimulation was chosen to induce pain intensity 50/100 (NRS). HP stimulation was applied with and without CT-targeted touch. Results: Experiment I: CT-stimulation was sufficient to reduce heat pain in healthy participants (p = 0.016), but not in SFN-patients. HP induced pain intensity was significantly higher (32,2 vs 52,6) in SFN-patients. During HP, bold responses in pain associated areas were observed in both groups. Additional CT-stimulation elicited no significant difference of bold responses compared to HP. Experiment II: In healthy volunteers, we reproduced a significant reduction of HP intensity by CT-stimulation (p = 0.038). Conclusions: CT input seems to be sufficient to modulate pain, independent of intensity of the pain stimulus. As a prerequisite, the CT fibers have to be intact as in healthy volunteers. If CT fibers are impaired -as in SFN-, CT-targeted touch does not modulate pain intensity. The location of CT-induced pain modulation might be attributed to the level of the dorsal horn since the cortical activation pattern of heat pain with and without CT-targeted touch did not differ in healthy subjects and in SFN-patients.","[Habig, Kathrin; Schirner, Wolfgang; Lautenschlaeger, Gothje; Kraemer, Heidrun H.] Justus Liebig Univ, Dept Neurol, Klin Str 33, D-35392 Giessen, Germany; [Schaenzer, Anne] Justus Liebig Univ, Inst Neuropathol, Arndtstr 16, D-35392 Giessen, Germany; [Dassinger, Benjamin] Justus Liebig Univ, Dept Radiol, Klin Str 33, D-35392 Giessen, Germany; [Olausson, Hakan] Linkoping Univ, Ctr Social & Affect Neurosci, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden; [Birklein, Frank] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Univ Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Langenbeckstr 1, D-56101 Mainz, Germany; [Gizewski, Elke R.] Med Univ Innsbruck, Dept Neuroradiol, Innrain 52, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria","Habig, K (reprint author), Justus Liebig Univ, Dept Neurol, Klin Str 33, D-35392 Giessen, Germany.","kathrin.habig@neuro.med.uni-giessen.de","","Gizewski, Elke Ruth/0000-0001-6859-8377","Forschungsfrderung 2 of the Justus Liebig University, Giessen","This work was supported by the Forschungsfrderung 2 of the Justus Liebig University, Giessen to HHK.","","38","2","2","3","11","BIOMED CENTRAL LTD","LONDON","236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND","1471-2377","","","BMC NEUROL","BMC Neurol.","SEP 15","2017","17","","","","","","","","184","10.1186/s12883-017-0963-6","","","","11","Clinical Neurology","Neurosciences & Neurology","FH2WU","WOS:000411003900003","28915853","DOAJ Gold, Green Published","","","2019-02-21","searchterm","searchterm_records_501-1000.txt"

Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have studied the neural mechanisms underlying bistable perception through univariate and multivariate pattern analyses; however, no studies have investigated the issue of category selectivity. Here, we used fMRI to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the Rubin face-vase illusion by introducing univariate amplitude and multivariate pattern analyses. The results from the amplitude analysis suggested that the activity in the fusiform face area was likely related to the subjective face perception. Furthermore, the pattern analysis results showed that the early visual cortex (EVC) and the faceselective cortex could discriminate the activity patterns of the face and vase perceptions. However, further analysis of the activity patterns showed that only the face-selective cortex contains the face information. These findings indicated that although the EVC and face-selective cortex activities could discriminate the visual information, only the activity and activity pattern in the face-selective areas contained the category information of face perception in the Rubin face-vase illusion.","[Wang, Xiaogang; Sang, Na; Hao, Lei; Qiu, Jiang] Minist Educ, Key Lab Cognit & Personal SWU, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaogang; Sang, Na; Hao, Lei; Qiu, Jiang] Southwest Univ, Fac Psychol, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yong] Southwest Univ Polit Sci & Law, Sch Foreign Languages, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Bi, Taiyong] Zunyi Med Univ, Sch Management, Zunyi, Guizhou, Peoples R China","Qiu, J (reprint author), Minist Educ, Key Lab Cognit & Personal SWU, Chongqing, Peoples R China.; Qiu, J (reprint author), Southwest Univ, Fac Psychol, Chongqing, Peoples R China.; Bi, TY (reprint author), Zunyi Med Univ, Sch Management, Zunyi, Guizhou, Peoples R China.","bitaiyong@swu.edu.cn; qiuj318@swu.edu.cn","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31271087, 31470981, 31571137, 31500885, 31400960]; National Outstanding Young People Plan; Program for the Top Young Talents by Chongqing; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [SWU1509383, SWU1509451]; Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing [cstc2015jcyjA10106]; Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation [151023]; General Financial Grant from the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015M572423, 2015M580767]; Special Funds from the Chongqing Postdoctoral Science Foundation [Xm2015037]; Key Research for Humanities and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education [14JJD880009]","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31271087, 31470981, 31571137, 31500885, 31400960), National Outstanding Young People Plan, the Program for the Top Young Talents by Chongqing, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (SWU1509383, SWU1509451), Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing (cstc2015jcyjA10106), Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation (151023), General Financial Grant from the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2015M572423, 2015M580767), Special Funds from the Chongqing Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Xm2015037), and Key Research for Humanities and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education (14JJD880009).","","53","1","1","1","5","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","PO BOX 110, EPFL INNOVATION PARK, BUILDING I, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND","1664-1078","","","FRONT PSYCHOL","Front.

Task-dependent increase in the coupling of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a region involved in cognitive control, and brain areas in the left prefrontal and right parietal cortex, respectively, regions involved in task execution, was proposed as the mechanism underlying this task-dependency of hemispheric lateralization. The aim of the present study was two-fold: First, we aimed for a conceptual replication of these findings in an independent sample of subjects. Second, we investigated the test retest reliability of the imaging paradigm to assess whether the task can be used to capture reliable measures of inter-individual differences in hemispheric lateralization. We were able to confirm previous findings showing that hemispheric lateralization depends on the nature of the cognitive task rather than on the nature of the processed stimuli. The task-related brain activation patterns were highly reliable across sessions (as indicated by intra-class correlation coefficients - ICCs, >=.51). We could, however, not replicate previous results proposing task-dependent changes in the coupling between ACC and brain regions for task execution as the mechanism underlying hemispheric lateralization. This re-opens the question which mechanisms could determine the task-dependent functional asymmetries that were observed previously and replicated in this study. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The high reward value of interpersonal closeness and touch in couples is a key proximate mechanism facilitating the maintenance of enduring romantic bonds. However, surprisingly, the neurobiological underpinnings mediating the unique experience of a romantic partner's touch remain unknown. In this randomized placebo (PLC)-controlled, between-group, pharmacofunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study involving 192 healthy volunteers (96 heterosexual couples), we intranasally administered 24 IU of the hypothalamic peptide oxytocin (OXT) to either the man or the woman. Subsequently, we scanned the subjects while they assumed that they were being touched by their romantic partners or by an unfamiliar person of the opposite sex, although in reality an identical pattern of touch was always given by the same experimenter. Our results show that intranasal OXT compared to PLC selectively enhanced the subjective pleasantness of the partner's touch. Importantly, intranasal OXT selectively increased responses to partner touch in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and anterior cingulate cortex. Under OXT, NAcc activations to partner touch positively correlated with the subjects' evaluation of their relationship quality. Collectively, our results suggest that OXT may contribute to the maintenance of monogamous relationships in humans by concomitantly increasing the reward value of partner touch and diminishing the hedonic quality of stranger touch.

However, it remains unresolved whether changes in one's own pain sensation may affect empathic responding to others' pain. Here we show that inducing analgesia through hypnosis leads to decreased responses to both self and vicarious experience of pain. Activations in the right anterior insula and amygdala were markedly reduced when participants received painful thermal stimuli following hypnotic analgesia on their own hand, but also when they viewed pictures of others' hand in pain. Functional connectivity analysis indicated that this hypnotic modulation of pain responses was associated with differential recruitment of right prefrontal regions implicated in selective attention and inhibitory control. Our results provide novel support to the view that self-nociception is involved during empathy for pain, and demonstrate the possibility to use hypnotic procedures to modulate higher-level emotional and social processes.","[Braboszcz, Claire; Vuilleumier, Patrik] Univ Geneva, Lab Behav Neurol & Imaging Cognit, Campus Biotech, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Braboszcz, Claire] Univ Plymouth, Sch Psychol, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Brandao-Farinelli, Edith] Univ Hosp Geneva, Dept Anesthesiol Pharmacol & Crit Care, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Vuilleumier, Patrik] Univ Geneva, Swiss Ctr Affect Sci, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland","Braboszcz, C (reprint author), Univ Geneva, Lab Behav Neurol & Imaging Cognit, Campus Biotech, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.; Braboszcz, C (reprint author), Univ Plymouth, Sch Psychol, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.","claire.braboszcz@plymouth.ac.uk","","Braboszcz, Claire/0000-0001-9572-6653","European Union's Seventh Framework Programme [267171]; Fyssen Foundation; European Union's Horizon research and innovation programme [660711]","This project was supported by funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme under grant agreement no. 267171 as well as from the Fyssen Foundation and from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement no. 660711.

Theories of embodied cognition and simulation suggest that this mechanism takes place through a direct and automatic matching process that occurs between an observed action and past actions. This process occurs via the reactivation of past self-related sensorimotor experiences within the inferior frontoparietal network (including the mirror neuron system, MNS). The working model is that the anticipatory representations of others behaviors require internal predictive models of actions formed from pre-established, shared representations between the observer and the actor. This model suggests that observers should be better at predicting intentions performed by a familiar actor, rather than a stranger. However, little is known about the modulations of the intention brain network as a function of the familiarity between the observer and the actor. Here, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a behavioral intention inference task, in which participants were asked to predict intentions from three types of actors: A familiar actor (their significant other), themselves (another familiar actor), and a non-familiar actor (a stranger). Our results showed that the participants were better at inferring intentions performed by familiar actors than non-familiar actors and that this better performance was associated with greater activation within and beyond the inferior frontoparietal network i.e., in brain areas related to familiarity (e.g., precuneus). In addition, and in line with Hebbian principles of neural modulations, the more the participants reported being cognitively close to their partner, the less the brain areas associated with action self-other comparison (e.g., inferior parietal lobule), attention (e.g., superior parietal lobule), recollection (hippocampus), and pair bond (ventral tegmental area. VTA) were recruited, suggesting that the more a shared mental representation has been pre-established, the more neurons show suppression in their response to the presentation of information to which they are sensitive. These results suggest that the relation of performance to the extent of neural activation during intention understanding may display differential relationships based on the cognitive domain, brain region, and the cognitive interdependence between the observer and the actor.","[Cacioppo, Stephanie] Univ Chicago, Dept Psychiat & Behav Neurosci, Div Biol Sci, Pritzker Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Cacioppo, Stephanie; Monteleone, George] Univ Chicago, Ctr Cognit & Social Neurosci, High Performance Elect NeuroImaging Lab, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Juan, Elsa] Univ Geneva, Dept Psychol, Geneva, Switzerland","Cacioppo, S (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Dept Psychiat & Behav Neurosci, Div Biol Sci, Pritzker Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.; Cacioppo, S (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Ctr Cognit & Social Neurosci, High Performance Elect NeuroImaging Lab, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.","scacioppo@bsd.uchicago.edu","","","Swiss National Science Foundation [FNS_PP00_1_128599/1]","The Swiss National Science Foundation (#FNS_PP00_1_128599/1 to SC) supported this work.

These task-based hemodynamic changes are synchronized across subjects and involve large areas of the cortex, and it is unclear whether individual differences in functional connectivity are enhanced or diminished under such naturalistic conditions. This work first aims to characterize variability in BOLD-signal based functional connectivity (FC) across 2 distinct movie conditions and eyes-open rest (n=31 healthy adults, 2 scan sessions each). We found that movies have higher within- and between-subject correlations in cluster-wise FC relative to rest. The anatomical distribution of inter-individual variability was similar across conditions, with higher variability occurring at the lateral prefrontal lobes and temporoparietal junctions. Second, we used an unsupervised test-retest matching algorithm that identifies individual subjects from within a group based on FC patterns, quantifying the accuracy of the algorithm across the three conditions. The movies and resting state all enabled identification of individual subjects based on FC matrices, with accuracies between 61% and 100%. Overall, pairings involving movies outperformed rest, and the social, fasterpaced movie attained 100% accuracy. When the parcellation resolution, scan duration, and number of edges used were increased, accuracies improved across conditions, and the pattern of movies > rest was preserved. These results suggest that using dynamic stimuli such as movies enhances the detection of FC patterns that are unique at the individual level.","[Vanderwal, Tamara; Eilbott, Jeffrey; Finn, Emily S.; Turnbull, Adam] Yale Univ, 230 South Frontage Rd, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Craddock, R.

Upon learning, participants viewed different badge/shape pairs and their task was to judge whether the viewed pair was a match or a mismatch. For whole brain analyses increased activity was found in the IFG, DLPFC, AI, fusiform gyrus, precuneus and pSTS (all in the left hemisphere) for the rival over the in-group mismatch. Further, the ROI analyses revealed larger beta-values for the rival badge in the left pSTS, left AI and the left IFG. However, larger beta-values were found in the left pSTS and the left IFG (but not AI) for the in-group shape. The intrinsic functional connectivity analyses revealed that compare to the pre-task, post task functional connectivity was decreased between the left DLPFC and the left AI. In contrast, it was increased between the left IFG and the left AI and this was correlated with the difference in RT for the rival vs. in-group team.

Ways through which social-ecological factors contribute to adolescent neural cognitive control have not been thoroughly examined. We hypothesize that household chaos is a context that may modulate the associations among parental control, adolescent neural cognitive control, and developmental changes in social competence. The sample involved 167 adolescents (ages 13-14 at Time 1, 53% male). Parental control and household chaos were measured using adolescents' questionnaire data, and cognitive control was assessed via behavioral performance and brain imaging at Time 1. Adolescent social competence was reported by adolescents at Time 1 and at Time 2 (one year later). Structural equation modeling analyses indicated that higher parental control predicted better neural cognitive control only among adolescents living in low-chaos households. The association between poor neural cognitive control at Time 1 and social competence at Time 2 (after controlling for social competence at Time 1) was significant only among adolescents living in high-chaos households. Household chaos may undermine the positive association of parental control with adolescent neural cognitive control and exacerbate the detrimental association of poor neural cognitive control with disrupted social competence development.","[Kim-Spoon, Jungmeen; Maciejewski, Dominique; King-Casas, Brooks] Virginia Tech, Dept Psychol, MC 0436, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Lee, Jacob; King-Casas, Brooks] Virginia Tech, Caril Res Inst, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Deater-Deckard, Kirby] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA","Kim-Spoon, J (reprint author), Virginia Tech, Dept Psychol, MC 0436, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.","jungmeen@vt.edu","","","National Institutes of Health [DA036017]","Support for this study was provide by the National Institutes of Health (DA036017; Kim-Spoon and Brooks King-Casas).

These dimensions are typically treated as independent in many neuroimaging experiments, yet recent behavioural findings suggest that they are actually interdependent. This result has impact on neuroimaging design, analysis and theoretical development. We were interested in determining the extent of this interdependence both behaviourally and neuroanatomically, as well as teasing apart any activation that is specific to each dimension. While we found extensive overlap in activation for each dimension in traditional emotion areas (bilateral insulae, orbitofrontal cortex, amygdalae), we also found activation specific to each dimension with characteristic relationships between modulations of these dimensions and BOLD signal change. Increases in arousal ratings were related to increased activations predominantly in voice-sensitive cortices after variance explained by valence had been removed. In contrast, emotions of extreme valence were related to increased activations in bilateral voice-sensitive cortices, hippocampi, anterior and midcingulum and medial orbito- and superior frontal regions after variance explained by arousal had been accounted for. Our results therefore do not support a complete segregation of brain structures underpinning the processing of affective dimensions.","[Bestelmeyer, Patricia E.

Indeed, behavioral studies have shown that observed social exclusion elicits prosocial compensating behavior in children, but motivations for the compensation of social exclusion are not well understood. To distinguish between self concerns and other-concerns when observing social exclusion in childhood, participants (aged 7-10) played a four-player Prosocial Cyberball Game in which they could toss a ball to three other players. When one player was excluded by the two other players, the participant could compensate for this exclusion by tossing the ball more often to the excluded player. Using a three-sample replication (N = 18, N = 27, and N = 26) and meta-analysis design, we demonstrated consistent prosocial compensating behavior in children in response to observing social exclusion. On a neural level, we found activity in reward and salience related areas (striatum and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)) when participants experienced inclusion, and activity in social perception related areas (orbitofrontal cortex) when participants experienced exclusion. In contrast, no condition specific neural effects were observed for prosocial compensating behavior. These findings suggest that in childhood observed social exclusion is associated with stronger neural activity for self-concern. This study aims to overcome some of the issues of replicability in developmental psychology and neuroscience by using a replication and meta-analysis design, showing consistent prosocial compensating behavior to the excluded player, and replicable neural correlates of experiencing exclusion and inclusion during middle childhood.","[van der Meulen, Mara; Steinbeis, Nikolaus; Achterberg, Michelle; Bilo, Elisabeth; van den Bulk, Bianca G.; van IJendoorn, Marinus H.; Crone, Eveline A.] Leiden Univ, Leiden Consortium Individual Dev, Leiden, Netherlands; [van der Meulen, Mara; Steinbeis, Nikolaus; Achterberg, Michelle; Crone, Eveline A.] Leiden Univ, Inst Psychol, Leiden, Netherlands; [van der Meulen, Mara; Steinbeis, Nikolaus; Achterberg, Michelle; van den Bulk, Bianca G.; Crone, Eveline A.] Leiden Univ, Leiden Inst Brain & Cognit, Leiden, Netherlands; [Bilo, Elisabeth; van den Bulk, Bianca G.; van IJendoorn, Marinus H.] Leiden Univ, Ctr Child & Family Studies, Leiden, Netherlands","van der Meulen, M (reprint author), Leiden Univ, Fac Social Sci, Wassenaarseweg 52, NL-2333 AK Leiden, Netherlands.","m.van.der.meulen@fsw.leidenuniv.nl","van IJzendoorn, Marinus/I-1379-2012","van IJzendoorn, Marinus/0000-0003-1144-454X; Crone, Eveline/0000-0002-7508-6078","Consortium on Individual Development (CID); Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [024.001.003]","The Consortium on Individual Development (CID) is funded through the Gravitation program of the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture, and Science and the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO grant number 024.001.003).","","46","2","2","8","24","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","0028-3932","1873-3514","","NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA","Neuropsychologia","AUG","2017","103","","","","","","29","37","","10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.07.008","","","","9","Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences; Psychology, Experimental","Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychology","FF3IR","WOS:000408789200004","28709987","","","","2019-02-21","searchterm","searchterm_records_501-1000.txt"

The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test media imagery and peer feedback combinations on neural activity related to thin-body ideals. Twenty-four healthy female late adolescents rated precategorized body sizes of bikini models (too thin or normal), directly followed by ostensible peer feedback (too thin or normal). Consistent with prior studies on social feedback processing, results showed increased brain activity in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC)/anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and bilateral insula in incongruent situations: when participants rated media models' body size as normal while peer feedback indicated the models as too thin (or vice versa). This effect was stronger for girls with lower self-esteem. A subsequent behavioral study (N = 34 female late adolescents, separate sample) demonstrated that participants changed behavior in the direction of the peer feedback: precategorized normal sized models were rated as too thin more often after receiving too thin peer feedback. This suggests that the neural responses upon peer feedback may influence subsequent choice.

The mechanism is rooted in scientific studies from various disciplines. For our evidence, we propose and estimate a dynamic model of tie formation using different experimental data sets regarding public goods, test its within-sample and out-of-sample predictive performance, and compare it with other models. In addition to the support obtained for the mechanism, we find that the effects of interaction experiences show substantial persistence over time, and that only a minority looks ahead to strategically influence the behavior of interaction partners. Furthermore, our model appears to track the often volatile behavioral dynamics of the different datasets remarkably well. Additional evidence is presented of a neural substrate of the tie mechanism, based on a recent (fMRI) application of the estimated model, and of the explanatory power of our model regarding other extant experimental findings.

While many studies have delineated the neural mechanisms supporting extrinsic motivation induced by monetary rewards, less work has examined the neural processes that support intrinsically motivated behaviors, such as self-improvement motivation. Because cultural groups traditionally vary in terms of their self-improvement motivation, we examined cultural differences in the behavioral and neural processes underlying motivated behaviors during cognitive persistence in the absence of extrinsic rewards. In Study 1, 71 American (47 females, M=19.68 years) and 68 Chinese (38 females, M=19.37 years) students completed a behavioral cognitive control task that required cognitive persistence across time. In Study 2, 14 American and 15 Chinese students completed the same cognitive persistence task during an fMRI scan. Across both studies, American students showed significant declines in cognitive performance across time, whereas Chinese participants demonstrated effective cognitive persistence. These behavioral effects were explained by cultural differences in self-improvement motivation and paralleled by increasing activation and functional coupling between the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and ventral striatum (VS) across the task among Chinese participants, neural activation and coupling that remained low in American participants. These findings suggest a potential neural mechanism by which the VS and IFG work in concert to promote cognitive persistence in the absence of extrinsic rewards. Thus, frontostriatal circuitry may be a neurobiological signal representing intrinsic motivation for self-improvement that serves an adaptive function, increasing Chinese students' motivation to engage in cognitive persistence.","[Telzer, Eva H.; Lin, Lynda C.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Qu, Yang] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Telzer, EH (reprint author), Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, 235 E,Cameron Ave, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.","ehtelzer@unc.edu","","Lin, Lynda/0000-0001-6703-4182","University of Illinois Psychology Department; Beckman Institute of Science and Technology at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign","We are grateful to the Biomedical Imaging Center at the Beckman Institute of Science and Technology at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign and Nicolas Ichien for support in collecting the fMRI data.

The memory enhancement related to the self is known as the self-reference effect (SRE). However, little is known regarding the neural mechanisms underlying the SRE in a social context modulated by social relationships. In the present fMRI study, we investigated encoding-related activation of face memories encoded with the self-referential process in a social context that was manipulated by imagining a person-to-person relationship. Healthy young adults participated in the present study. During encoding, participants encoded unfamiliar target faces by imagining a future friendship with themselves (Self), their friends (Friend), or strangers (Other). During retrieval, participants were presented with target and distracter faces one by one, and they judged whether each face had been previously learned. In the behavioral results, target faces encoded in the Self condition were remembered more accurately than those encoded in the Other condition. fMRI results demonstrated that encoding-related activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was significantly greater in the Self condition than in the Friend or Other conditions. In addition, the generalized psycho-physiological interaction (gPPI) analysis showed that functional connectivity between activation in the hippocampus and the cortical midline structures (CMSs), including the mPFC and precuneus, was significant in the Self but not in the Other condition.

This utterance was either direct, indirect but relevant, irrelevant with contextual hint, or irrelevant with no contextual hint. Results indicated that compared with direct replies, indirect replies showed increased activations in bilateral IFG, bilateral MTG, bilateral TPJ, dmPFC, and precuneus, and increased connectivity between rTPJ/dmPFC and both IFG and MTG. Moreover, irrelevant replies activated right MTG along an anterior-posterior gradient as a function of the level of irrelevance.

This involves shifting attention between different perspectives. Previous studies suggest that flexibility is mainly subserved by the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). However, although rarely emphasized, the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is frequently recruited during flexible behaviour. A crucial question is whether TPJ plays a role in different types of flexibility, compared to its limited role in perceptual flexibility. We hypothesized that TPJ activity during diverse flexibility tasks plays a common role in stimulus-driven attention-shifting, thereby contributing to different types of flexibility, and thus the collaboration between DLPFC and TPJ might serve as a more appropriate mechanism than DLPFC alone. We used fMRI to measure DLPFC/TPJ activity recruited during moral flexibility, and examined its effect on other domains of flexibility (economic/perceptual). Here, we show the additional, yet crucial role of TPJ: a combined DLPFC/TPJ activity predicted flexibility, regardless of domain. Different types of flexibility might rely on more basic attention-shifting, which highlights the behavioural significance of alternatives.","[Tei, Shisei; Fujino, Junya; Kawada, Ryosaku; Sugihara, Genichi; Miyata, Jun; Murai, Toshiya; Takahashi, Hidehiko] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Tei, Shisei] Waseda Univ, Inst Appl Brain Sci, 2-579-15 Mikajima, Tokorozawa, Saitama 3591192, Japan; [Tei, Shisei] Tokyo Int Univ, Sch Human & Social Sci, Saitama 3501198, Japan; [Fujino, Junya] Showa Univ, Karasuyama Hosp, Med Inst Dev Disabil Res, Tokyo 1578577, Japan; [Jankowski, Kathryn F.] Univ Oregon, Dept Psychol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Kauppi, Jukka-Pekka] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Math Informat Technol, Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Kauppi, Jukka-Pekka] Univ Helsinki, Dept Comp Sci, PO 68 Gustaf Hallstromin Katu 2b, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Kauppi, Jukka-Pekka] Univ Helsinki, HIIT, PO 68 Gustaf Hallstromin Katu 2b, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [van den Bos, Wouter] Max Planck Inst Human Dev, Ctr Adapt Rat, D-14197 Berlin, Germany; [Abe, Nobuhito] Kyoto Univ, Kokoro Res Ctr, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068507, Japan","Takahashi, H (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068507, Japan.","hidehiko@kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp","","Abe, Nobuhito/0000-0002-9897-4414; van den Bos, Wouter/0000-0002-8017-3790","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (MEXT) [24243061, 15H04750, 23120009, 16H01504, 16H06572]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [23680045]; Strategic Research Program for Brain Sciences by Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED); Joint Usage/Research Program of Medical Institute of Developmental Disabilities Research, Showa University; Kobayashi Magobei Foundation; Takeda Foundation; Uehiro Foundation on Ethics and Education; Academy of Finland Postdoctoral Researcher program (Research Council for Natural Sciences and Engineering) [286019]; Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science International Research Fellowship; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Opportunities Worldwide (GROW) Fellowship [2011122786]","This work was supported by grants-in-aid for scientific research A (24243061), B (15H04750) and for Innovative Areas (23120009, 16H01504, 16H06572), from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (MEXT); Grants-in-Aid for Young Scientists A (23680045) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).

The psychodynamic view, however, is commonly not supported by self-report studies on subclinical narcissism. Personality neuroscience might help to better understand the phenomenon of narcissism beyond the limits of self-report research. While social-cognitive theory would predict that self-relevant processing should be accompanied by brain activity in reward-related areas in narcissistic individuals, psychodynamic theory would suggest that it should be accompanied by activation in regions pointing to negative affect or emotional conflict. In this study, extreme groups of high and low narcissistic individuals performed a visual self-recognition paradigm during fMRI. Viewing one's own face (as compared to faces of friends and strangers) was accompanied by greater activation of the dorsal and ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in highly narcissistic men. These results suggest that highly narcissistic men experience greater negative affect or emotional conflict during self-relevant processing and point to vulnerable aspects of subclinical narcissism that might not be apparent in self-report research.","[Jauk, Emanuel; Benedek, Mathias; Koschutnig, Karl; Kedia, Gayannee; Neubauer, Aljoscha C.] Univ Graz Austria, BioTechMed Graz, Graz, Austria","Jauk, E (reprint author), Univ Graz Austria, BioTechMed Graz, Graz, Austria.","emanuel.jauk@uni-graz.at","Kedia, Gayannee/J-2355-2018","Kedia, Gayannee/0000-0003-0163-0867; Benedek, Mathias/0000-0001-6258-4476; Jauk, Emanuel/0000-0003-3267-1688; Koschutnig, Karl/0000-0001-6234-0498","Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P23914]","This research was supported by a grant from the Austrian Science Fund (FWF): P23914.

Raw perceptions would be useless without an ability to classify items as, for example, threat or food. Previous work suggests that people have a tendency to group stimuli either on the basis of a single dimension or by overall similarity (e.g., Milton, F.N., Longmore, C.A., and Wills, A.J. (2008). Processes of overall similarity sorting in free classification. J. Exp. Psychol. Hum. Percept. Perform, 34, 676-692.). It has recently been suggested that overall similarity sorting can engage similar rule-based processes to single-dimension sorting and, in addition, requires greater use of working memory (Milton, F.N., and Wills, A. J. (2004). The influences of stimulus properties on category construction. J. Exp. Psychol. Learn. Mem. Cogn, 30, 407-415.). These predictions were tested in an event-related fMRI study of spontaneous categorization. Results showed a striking overlap of activation between overall similarity and single-dimension sorting indicating engagement of common neural processes. Furthermore, overall similarity sorting recruited additional activity in bilateral precuneus, right cuneus, left cerebellum, left postcentral gyrus, right thalamus and right ventrolateral frontal cortex (VLFC). Our findings suggest that overall similarity sorting can be the result of rule-based processes and highlight a potential role for right VLFC in integrating multi-dimensional sensory information to form conceptual categories.

For example, we are more motivated to do well on a task when we are told that our abilities are being evaluated. We set out to study the effect of self-motivation on a working memory task. By telling one group of participants that we were assessing their cognitive abilities, and another group that we were simply optimizing task parameters, we managed to enhance the motivation to do well in the first group. We matched the performance between the groups. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, the motivated group showed enhanced activity when making errors.

The anterior paracingulate activity correlated with self-image ratings, and overlapped with activity when participants explicitly reflected upon their performance.

Previously, imaging studies have investigated neural correlates of facial motion primarily using abstract motion stimuli. Here, we studied how the brain processes natural non-rigid facial motion in direct comparison to static stimuli and matched phase-scrambled controls. As predicted from previous studies, dynamic faces elicit higher responses than static faces in lateral temporal areas corresponding to hMT+/V5 and STS. Interestingly, individually defined, static-face-sensitive regions in bilateral fusiform gyrus and left inferior occipital gyrus also respond more to dynamic than static faces. These results suggest integration of form and motion information during the processing of dynamic faces even in ventral temporal and inferior lateral occipital areas. In addition, our results show that dynamic stimuli are a robust tool to localize areas related to the processing of static and dynamic face information.","[Pilz, Karin S.] McMaster Univ, Dept Psychol Neurosci & Behav, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Schultz, Johannes] Max Planck Inst Biol Cybernet, Dept Human Percept Cognit & Act, Tubingen, Germany","Pilz, KS (reprint author), McMaster Univ, Dept Psychol Neurosci & Behav, 1280 Main St W, Hamilton, ON, Canada.","pilzk@mcmaster.ca","Pilz, Karin/U-7476-2017; Schultz, Johannes/B-8613-2012","Pilz, Karin/0000-0003-4566-9122; Schultz, Johannes/0000-0003-4117-232X","","","","67","92","93","0","9","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","0014-4819","1432-1106","","EXP BRAIN RES","Exp.

In Experiment 1, participants learned two sets of novel words on successive days. A subsequent recognition test revealed high levels of familiarity for both sets. However, a lexical decision task showed that only novel words learned on the previous day engaged in lexical competition with similar-sounding existing words. Additionally, only novel words learned on the previous day exhibited faster repetition latencies relative to unfamiliar controls. This overnight consolidation effect was further examined using fMRI to compare neural responses to existing and novel words learned on different days prior to scanning (Experiment 2). This revealed an elevated response for novel compared with existing words in left superior temporal gyrus (STG), inferior frontal and premotor regions, and right cerebellum. Cortical activation was of equivalent magnitude for unfamiliar novel words and items learned on the day of scanning but significantly reduced for novel words learned on the previous day. In contrast, hippocampal responses were elevated for novel words that were entirely unfamiliar, and this elevated response correlated with postscanning behavioral measures of word learning. These findings are consistent with a dual-learning system account in which there is a division of labor between medial-temporal systems that are involved in initial acquisition and neocortical systems in which representations of novel spoken words are subject to overnight consolidation.","[Davis, Matthew H.] Cognit & Brain Sci Unit, Cambridge, England; [Di Betta, Anna Maria; Gaskell, M.

This proposition stands in sharp contrast to the standard economic assumption of rationality that requires individuals to judge the value of money only on the basis of the bundle of goods that it can buy-its real value-and not on the basis of the actual amount of currency-its nominal value. We used fMRI to investigate whether the brain's reward circuitry exhibits money illusion. Subjects received prizes in 2 different experimental conditions that were identical in real economic terms, but differed in nominal terms. Thus, in the absence of money illusion there should be no differences in activation in reward-related brain areas. In contrast, we found that areas of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), which have been previously associated with the processing of anticipatory and experienced rewards, and the valuation of goods, exhibited money illusion. We also found that the amount of money illusion exhibited by the vmPFC was correlated with the amount of money illusion exhibited in the evaluation of economic transactions.","[Wibral, Matthias; Falk, Armin] Univ Bonn, Dept Econ, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Weber, Bernd] Univ Bonn, Dept Epileptol, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Weber, Bernd] Univ Bonn, Dept Neurocognit, Life & Brain Ctr, D-53127 Bonn, Germany; [Rangel, Antonio] CALTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Falk, A (reprint author), Univ Bonn, Dept Econ, Adenauerallee 24-42, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.","armin.falk@uni-bonn.de","Weber, Bernd/H-5244-2012","Weber, Bernd/0000-0002-7811-9605","Deutsche Forschungsgesellschaft [SFB/TR 15]; European Research Council Starting Grant","We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Deutsche Forschungsgesellschaft through SFB/TR 15 and from the European Research Council Starting Grant.","","24","38","40","0","9","NATL ACAD SCIENCES","WASHINGTON","2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA","0027-8424","","","P NATL ACAD SCI USA","Proc.

However, the functional significance of STPs remains largely unknown. Methodology/Principal Finding: Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we first identified an STPs-network whose activity was positively correlated with the subjects' tendency of having STPs during a task-free state. The STPs-network was then found to be strongly associated with the default network, which has previously been established as being active during the task-free state. Interestingly, we found that offline reprocessing of previously memorized information further increased the activity of the STPs-network regions, although during a state with less STPs. In addition, we found that the STPs-network kept a dynamic balance between functional integration and functional separation among its component regions to execute offline memory reprocessing in STPs. Conclusion/Significance: These findings strengthen a view that offline memory reprocessing and STPs share the brain's default network, and thus implicate that offline memory reprocessing may be a predetermined function of STPs. This supports the perspective that memory can be consolidated and modified during STPs, and thus gives rise to a dynamic behavior dependent on both previous external and internal experiences.","[Wang, Kun; Xu, Lijuan; Jiang, Tianzi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, Natl Lab Pattern Recognit, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yu, Chunshui; Qin, Wen; Li, Kuncheng] Capital Med Univ, Xuanwu Hosp, Dept Radiol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xu, Lin] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Zool, Lab Learning & Memory, Kunming, Peoples R China","Wang, K (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, Natl Lab Pattern Recognit, Beijing, Peoples R China.","jiangtz@nlpr.ia.ac.cn","Jiang, Tianzi/I-4256-2012","Jiang, Tianzi/0000-0001-9531-291X; Yu, Chunshui/0000-0001-5648-5199; Xu, Lin/0000-0002-2710-3507; Qin, Wen/0000-0002-9121-8296","Natural Science Foundation of China [30425004, 60121302]; National Key Basic Research and Development Program (973) [2004CB318107]; Beijing Scientific and Technological New Star Program [2005B21]; CAS graduate science and social practice special funding innovative research projects","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant Nos. 30425004, and 60121302, the National Key Basic Research and Development Program (973), Grant No. 2004CB318107, Beijing Scientific and Technological New Star Program Grant No. 2005B21, and CAS graduate science and social practice special funding innovative research projects.

Evidence from language and sensory paradigms suggests that the superior temporal sulcus and gyrus (STS/STG) play a key role in the integration of auditory and visual cues. Emotion perception research has focused on static facial cues; however, dynamic audio-visual (AV) cues mimic real-world social cues more accurately than static and/or unimodal stimuli. Novel dynamic AV stimuli were presented using a block design in two fMRI studies, comparing bimodal stimuli to unimodal conditions, and emotional to neutral stimuli. Results suggest that the bilateral superior temporal region plays distinct roles in the perception of emotion and in the integration of auditory and visual cues.

Recent imaging studies have shown that imitation of facial expressions is associated with activation in limbic regions such as the amygdala. Yet, the physiological interaction between this limbic activation and facial feedback remains unclear. To study if facial feedback effects on limbic brain responses during intentional imitation of facial expressions, we applied botulinum toxin (BTX)-induced denervation of frown muscles in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging as a reversible lesion model to minimize the occurrence of afferent muscular and cutaneous input. We show that, during imitation of angry facial expressions, reduced feedback due to BTX treatment attenuates activation of the left amygdala and its functional coupling with brain stem regions implicated in autonomic manifestations of emotional states. These findings demonstrate that facial feedback modulates neural activity within central circuitries of emotion during intentional imitation of facial expressions. Given that people tend to mimic the emotional expressions of others, this could provide a potential physiological basis for the social transfer of emotion.","[Hennenlotter, Andreas; Dresel, Christian; Castrop, Florian; Wohlschlager, Afra M.; Haslinger, Bernhard] Tech Univ Munich, Klinikum Rechts Isar, Neurol Klin, D-81675 Munich, Germany; [Hennenlotter, Andreas] Max Planck Inst Kognit & Neurowissensch, Abt Neuropsychol, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Baumann, Andres O.

Ten adults (22-32 years) and 18 adolescents (11-18 years) were scanned while thinking about scenarios in which a social or a basic emotion would be experienced. Unlike basic emotions (such as disgust and fear), social emotions (such as embarrassment and guilt) require the representation of another's mental states. In both adults and adolescents, an anterior rostral region of medial prefrontal cortex (arMPFC) involved in mentalising showed greater connectivity with the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) bordering on the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and with anterior temporal cortex (ATC) during social than during basic emotion. This result provides novel evidence that components of the mentalising system interact functionally during a social emotion task. Furthermore, functional connectivity differed between adolescence and adulthood.

Despite the visible role played by gesture in social interactions, relatively little is known about how the brain integrates hand gestures with co-occurring speech. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and an ecologically valid paradigm to investigate how beat gesture-a fundamental type of hand gesture that marks speech prosody-might impact speech perception at the neural level. Subjects underwent fMRI while listening to spontaneously-produced speech accompanied by beat gesture, nonsense hand movement, or a still body; as additional control conditions, subjects also viewed beat gesture, nonsense hand movement, or a still body all presented without speech. Validating behavioral evidence that gesture affects speech perception, bilateral nonprimary auditory cortex showed greater activity when speech was accompanied by beat gesture than when speech was presented alone. Further, the left superior temporal gyrus/sulcus showed stronger activity when speech was accompanied by beat gesture than when speech was accompanied by nonsense hand movement. Finally, the right planum temporale was identified as a putative multisensory integration site for beat gesture and speech (i.e., here activity in response to speech accompanied by beat gesture was greater than the summed responses to speech alone and beat gesture alone), indicating that this area may be pivotally involved in synthesizing the rhythmic aspects of both speech and gesture. Taken together, these findings suggest a common neural substrate for processing speech and gesture, likely reflecting their joint communicative role in social interactions.

One such process may rely on precompiled, semantic beliefs about the characteristics common to members of a social group, that is, on stereotypes; for example, judging that a woman may be more likely than a man to have certain interests or opinions. In the current study, we identified a pattern of neural activity associated with the use of stereotypes to judge another person's psychological characteristics. During fMRI scanning, participants mentalized about the likely responses of a female and male target to a series of questions, some of which were related to gender stereotypes ( e. g., ""enjoys shopping for new clothes''). Trials on which participants applied a stereotype were segregated from those on which participants avoided stereotype use. The BOLD response in an extensive region of the right frontal cortex differentiated stereotype-applied from-unapplied trials. Moreover, this neural difference was correlated with a behavioral index of gender associations-the Implicit Association Test administered after scanning. Results suggest that stereotype application may draw on cognitive processes that more generally subserve semantic knowledge about categories.","[Mitchell, Jason P.] Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Mitchell, JP (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, William James Hall,33 Kirkland St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.","mitchell@wjh.harvard.edu","","","National Science Foundation [BCS 0642448]; National Center for Research Resources [P41RR14075]; Mental Illness and Neuroscience Discovery (MIND) Institute","We thank D.

In a phenomenon known as temporal discounting, people value immediate gains over future gains. According to a future self-continuity hypothesis, individuals perceive and treat the future self differently from the present self, and so might fail to save for their future. Neuroimaging offers a novel means of testing this hypothesis, since previous research indicates that self- vs other-judgments elicit activation in the rostral anterior cingulate (rACC). Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, we predicted and found not only individual differences in rACC activation while rating the current vs future self, but also that individual differences in current vs future self activation predicted temporal discounting assessed behaviorally a week after scanning. In addition to supporting the future self-continuity hypothesis, these findings hold implications for significant financial decisions, such as choosing whether to save for the future or spend in the present.","[Ersner-Hershfield, Hal; Wimmer, G.

However, although some studies reported involvement of the insula, little attention has been paid to this region as forming part of the ""self''-network. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we aimed at replicating and extending previous studies by scanning subjects whilst reflecting upon their own personal qualities as compared to those of an acquaintance. A third condition with statements about general knowledge was used to control for attention, semantic processing and decision making processes. The results showed a significant effect of task in brain activity, consistent with previous findings, by which both person conditions recruited a common set of medial prefrontal and posterior regions, yet significant differences between self and other were found in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Notably, significant neural activation in the left anterior insula was observed as uniquely associated with self-reflection. Conclusions/Significance: The results provide further evidence for the specific recruitment of anterior MPFC and ACC regions for self-related processing, and highlight a role for the insula in self-reflection. As the insula is closely connected with ascending internal body signals, this may indicate that the accumulation of changes in affective states that might be implied in self-processing may contribute to our sense of self.","[Modinos, Gemma; Aleman, Andre] Univ Groningen, BCN Neuroimaging Ctr, Groningen, Netherlands; [Ormel, Johan] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, ICPE, Dept Psychiat, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands","Modinos, G (reprint author), Univ Groningen, BCN Neuroimaging Ctr, Groningen, Netherlands.","g.modinos@med.umcg.nl","Aleman, Andre/E-1341-2012; Frank, David/E-8213-2012; Ormel, Johan/C-6094-2013","","European Science Foundation EURYI [044035001]","This work was supported by European Science Foundation EURYI grant (NWO number: 044035001) awarded to AA.

We examined neural changes related to variations in working memory load by using an n-back task with three levels and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Younger adults were divided into high- and low-performing groups (Young-High; Young-Low) and compared with older adults. Relative to Young-High, capacity-constraints in working memory were apparent between load 1-2 for the elderly and between load 2-3 for Young-Low. Capacity-constraints in neural activity followed this pattern by showing a monotonically increasing response in parietal cortex and thalamus for Young-High, whereas activity leveled off at 1-back for the elderly and at 2-back for Young-Low. The response in dorsal frontal cortex followed a similar pattern with the addition that the magnitude of activation differed within capacity limitations (Old > Young at 1-back; Young-Low > Young-High at 2-back).

Although neural processes underlying social decision making are suggested to overlap with those involved in economic decision making, the neural systems associated with women's sexual decision making are unknown. Using fMRI, we measured the brain activation of 12 women while they viewed photos of men's faces. Face stimuli were accompanied by information regarding each man's potential risk as a sexual partner, indicated by a written description of the man's number of previous sexual partners and frequency of condom use. Participants were asked to evaluate how likely they would be to have sex with the man depicted. Women reported that they would be more likely to have sex with low compared to high risk men. Stimuli depicting low risk men also elicited stronger activation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), midbrain. and intraparietal sulcus, possibly reflecting an influence of sexual risk on women's attraction, arousal, and attention during their sexual decision making. Activation in the ACC was positively correlated with women's subjective evaluations of sex likelihood and response times during their evaluations of high, but not low risk men. These findings provide evidence that neural systems involved in sexual decision making in women overlap with those described previously to underlie nonsexual decision making.

Even backward masked fearful faces facilitate spatial attention. However, visual stimuli other than fearful faces can signal potential threat. Indeed, unmasked snakes and spiders modulate spatial attention. Yet, it is unclear if the rapid threat-related facilitation of spatial attention to backward masked stimuli is elicited by non-face threat cues. Evolutionary theories claim that phylogenetic threats (i.e. snakes and spiders) should preferentially elicit an automatic fear response, but it is untested as to whether this response extends to enhancements in spatial attention under restricted processing conditions. Thirty individuals completed a backward masking dot-probe task with both evolutionary relevant and irrelevant threat cues. The results suggest that backward masked visual fear stimuli modulate spatial attention.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we show that there are at least two neural mechanisms differentiating social perception in lonely and nonlonely young adults. For pleasant depictions, lonely individuals appear to be less rewarded by social stimuli, as evidenced by weaker activation of the ventral striatum to pictures of people than of objects, whereas nonlonely individuals showed stronger activation of the ventral striatum to pictures of people than of objects. For unpleasant depictions, lonely individuals were characterized by greater activation of the visual cortex to pictures of people than of objects, suggesting that their attention is drawn more to the distress of others, whereas nonlonely individuals showed greater activation of the right and left temporo-parietal junction to pictures of people than of objects, consistent with the notion that they are more likely to reflect spontaneously on the perspective of distressed others.","[Cacioppo, John T.] Univ Chicago, Ctr Cognit & Social Neurosci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Norris, Catherine J.] Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA","Cacioppo, JT (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Ctr Cognit & Social Neurosci, 5848 S Univ Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.","Cacioppo@uchicago.edu","","","NIMH [P50 MH72850]; NIA [PO1 AG18911]; John Templeton Foundation","We thank Robert Lyons, Carden Safran, John Scott Railton, J.

To understand the mechanisms underlying pro-sociality toward self-resembling faces, we investigated the neural correlates of implicit trustworthiness ratings for self-resembling faces. Here we show that idiosyncratic trustworthiness ratings of self-resembling faces predict brain activation in the ventral inferior, middle and medial frontal gyri, substrates involved in reward processing. These findings demonstrate that neural reward centers are implicated in evaluating implicit pro-social behaviors toward self-resembling faces. These findings suggest that humans have evolved to use neurocomputational architecture dedicated to face processing and reward evaluation for the differentiation of kin, which drives implicit idiosyncratic affectively regulated social interactions.

It is likely that the engagement of these processes by music can have beneficial effects on the psychological and physiological health of individuals, although the mechanisms underlying such effects are currently not well understood.

Then, neuroscientific studies using music to investigate emotion, perception-action mediation (""mirror function""), and social cognition are reviewed, including illustrations of the relevance of these domains for music therapy.","Univ Sussex, Dept Psychol, Brighton BN1 9QH, E Sussex, England","Koelsch, S (reprint author), Univ Sussex, Dept Psychol, Pevensey Bldg, Brighton BN1 9QH, E Sussex, England.","koelsch@cbs.mpg.de","","","","","","60","114","123","10","85","WILEY-BLACKWELL","MALDEN","COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN STREET, MALDEN 02148, MA USA","0077-8923","","978-1-57331-739-9","ANN NY ACAD SCI","Ann.NY Acad.Sci.","","2009","1169","","","","","","374","384","","10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04592.x","","","","11","Psychology, Developmental; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Neurosciences; Psychology; Psychology, Experimental","Psychology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Neurosciences & Neurology","BKY88","WOS:000269652300058","19673812","","","","2019-02-21","searchterm","searchterm_records_5500-5635.txt"

Fourteen participants were measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with the visual Go/No-go task after normal sleep and following 36 hours of TSD. The TSD-induced positive and negative blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals compared with that after a normal night's sleep (NORM). The areas activated with positive BOLD signals include the superior prefrontal cortex and inferior prefrontal cortex, with negative BOLD signals in the anterior cingulated cortex (ACC) and right lingual gyrus. Increased activation may be related to the compensatory response since more attention resources are needed to perform the Go/No-go task after 36 hours of TSD and the decreased activation in the ACC may reflect the impact of executive control function by the TSD.","[Shao, Yongcong; Fan, Ming; Ye, Enmao; Bi, Guohua; Yang, Zheng] Beijing Inst Basic Med Sci, Beijing 100850, Peoples R China; [Shao, Yongcong; Qi, Jianlin; Miao, Danmin] Fourth Mil Med Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Qi, Jianlin] AF Gen Hosp, Peoples Liberat Army China, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wen, Bo] Gen Hosp, Peoples Liberat Army China, Beijing, Peoples R China","Yang, Z (reprint author), Beijing Inst Basic Med Sci, Taiping Rd 27, Beijing 100850, Peoples R China.","yangzhengchina@yahoo.com.cn; psych@fmmu.edu.cn","","","","","","26","0","0","0","1","SOC PERSONALITY RES INC","PALMERSTON NORTH","P O BOX 1539, PALMERSTON NORTH 5330, NEW ZEALAND","0301-2212","1179-6391","","SOC BEHAV PERSONAL","Soc.

Greater effective connectivity from left MOFC to amygdala differentiated positive and neutral expressions from negatively valenced angry, disgust, and fear expressions. Greater effective connectivity from right LOFC to amygdala differentiated emotion expressions conducive to perceiver approach (happy, neutral, and fear) from angry expressions that elicit perceiver withdrawal. Finally, consistent with the categorical view, there were unique patterns of connectivity in response to fear, anger, and disgust, although not in response to happy expressions, which did not differ from neutral ones.","[Liang, Xiaoyun; Zebrowitz, Leslie A.] Brandeis Univ, Dept Psychol MS 062, Waltham, MA 02454 USA; [Aharon, Itzhak] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Charlestown, MA USA","Zebrowitz, LA (reprint author), Brandeis Univ, Dept Psychol MS 062, Waltham, MA 02454 USA.","zebrowitz@brandeis.edu","","Liang, Xiaoyun/0000-0002-1851-3408","National Institutes of Mental Health [MH066836, K02MH72603]","This work was supported by the National Institutes of Mental Health Grants (grant numbers MH066836 and K02MH72603) to L.

The increased scrutiny highlighted the lack of controlled oreal lifeo, i.e. prospective clinical trials of this technology that conform to the common standards of medical device development. The ethics of conducting such trials given the paucity of data on fMRI-based lie detection has also been questioned. To probe the potential issues of translating the laboratory research into practice, we conducted a case study in which we adapted the standard Guilty Knowledge Test (GKT), a well-established model of producing deception, to the common scenario of lying on a resume. The task consisted of questions about pertinent items on the subject's resume, three of which could be independently verified as truth (KNOWN) and three that could not be verified and were thus termed UNKNOWN. The subject had an incentive to lie on all UNKNOWN items, and on debriefing confirmed that he had done so. Data was preprocessed, masked with a priori regions of interest, thresholded, and qualitatively evaluated for consistency with the previously reported prefronto-parietal Lie Truth pattern. Deceptive responses to two out of the three UNKNOWN items were associated with the predicted prefronto-parietal fMRI pattern. In the third UNKNOWN this pattern was absent, and instead, increased limbic (amygdala and hippocampus) response was observed. Based on published prefronto-parietal Lie response pattern, only the first two items could be categorized as Lie. If confirmed, this demonstration of amygdala and hippocampus activation in a Lie Truth contrast illustrates the need to integrate the limbic system and its emotional and cognitive correlates into the existing model of deception. Our experiment suggests an approach to a naturalistic scenario and the research questions that need to be answered in order to set the stage for prospective clinical trials of fMRI-based lie detection.","[Langleben, D.

The reasoning is that there is a neural locus or circuit for lying that is sensitive, specific, generalizable across individuals and measurement contexts, and robust to countermeasures. To determine the extent to which the group results predicted lying at the level of the individual, we reanalyzed data on 14 participants from a study that had previously identified regions involved in lying (thus satisfying the criterion for sensitivity). We assessed the efficacy of functionally determined brain regions based on the lie-truth contrast for N - 1 participants to detect deception in the Nth individual. Results showed that no region could be used to correctly detect deception across all individuals. The best results were obtained for medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), correctly identifying 71% of participants as lying with no false alarms. Lowering the threshold for a response increased hits and false alarms. The results suggest that although brain imaging is a more direct index of cognition than the traditional polygraph, it is subject to many of the same caveats and thus neuroimaging does not appear to reveal processes that are necessarily unique to deception.","[Monteleone, George T.] Univ Chicago, Ctr Cognit & Social Neurosci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Fienberg, Stephen E.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA","Monteleone, GT (reprint author), Univ Chicago, Ctr Cognit & Social Neurosci, 5848 S Univ Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.","","","","Department of Army Research [DAAD19-03-1-0042]; MacArthur Law & Neuroscience Project","We thank Alex Japour for his contributions to this research.
