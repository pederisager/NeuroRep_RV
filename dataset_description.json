  "description": "This repository contains materials and data related to the first component of the NeuroRep project. The goal of this project component is to select a target study for replication based partly on quantitative estimates of the replication value of a large dataset of relevant studies within the social neuroscience literature. A subgoal is to empirically validate the replication value quantification procedure against the intuitive judgement of a sample of researchers within the field.",
